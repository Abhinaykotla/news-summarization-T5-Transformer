This is the heart-stopping moment a truck travelling the wrong way along a motorway crashes headlong into a Ford Mustang, bursting into two of flame and killing both drivers. Jeremy Smeltzer, 29, was spotted careering along the left-hand side of U.S. 131, near Plainwell, Michigan, in a lorry just before midnight on April 15. Michigan troopers set off in pursuit, desperately trying to overtake and stop him before there was a serious accident. But they were too late. Scroll down for video . Debris: Debris flies into the windscreen of one of the troopers' cars as Smeltzer's lorry careers into Jaryd Ford's Mustang . Fireballs: Both vehicles burst instantly into balls of flame, lighting up the highway as more officers rushed to the scene . Jeremy Smeltzer's (left) family paid tribute to the keen fisherman, saying he was a 'pure joy to be around'. He died in hospital after the incident while Jaryd Ford (right) was pronounced dead at the scene . Just as one of the officers pulled into the hard shoulder to perform a U-turn into Smeltzer's lane, 21-year-old Jaryd Ford's Mustang speeds past, smashing straight into the truck. The camera in the trooperâ€™s car captures the collision as debris scatters onto the highway. 'He hit a car, he just hit a car,' the trooper says as he witnesses the crash. Sole survivor: As flames light up the highway, more officers rushed to the scene and managed to drag Megan Covey, 26, from the passenger seat of Ford's car before it was consumed by fire . Tragic: Ford, however, was pronounced dead at the scene while Smeltzer died later in hospital . Too late: Moments earlier, one of the officers pulled into the hard shoulder to perform a U-turn into Smeltzer's lane in a bid to stop him. But it was too late . Mystery: It is unclear why Smeltzer was driving on the wrong side of the road as police await toxicology reports to see if either driver had been drinking . Both vehicles burst instantly into balls of flame, lighting up the highway as more officers rushed to the scene. Incredibly, the quick-thinking troopers managed to drag Megan Covey, 26, from the passenger seat of Ford's car before it was consumed by fire. She was last night being treated in hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. Ford, however, was pronounced dead at the scene while Smeltzer died later in hospital. It is unclear why Smeltzer was driving on the wrong side of the road as police await toxicology reports. Married Smeltzer's family paid tribute to him on a website, describing him as a 'pure joy to be around'. 'Jeremy enjoyed making people laugh, time with his dogs (Ender & Newton), hockey, fishing, and time with his wife and family,' they wrote. 'He loved reading, writing, singing too loud and making up stories. He was a pure joy to be around.'","The crash happened on the U.S. 131 highway, near Plainwell, Michigan .

fef8ad9fec16dbe0d2b035cbaa7f432c1ba261c2,"Editor's note: Frances Fragos Townsend, a CNN contributor on national security issues, formerly served as President George W. Bush's chief anti-terrorism and homeland security adviser. Townsend has spent more than two decades in the fields of intelligence and criminal justice and has served during the past three administrations. Townsend is currently a consultant to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a member of President Bush's Intelligence Advisory Board, the Council on Foreign Relations and the Aspen Institute Homeland Security Program. Frances Townsend says the director of the CIA is not a post for on-the-job training. (CNN) -- Leon Panetta is an impressive man with many laudable achievements to his credit. Mr. Panetta served eight terms in Congress and worked in the Clinton White House as chief of staff to the president and director of the Office of Management and Budget. But his impressive credentials are insufficient to allay the well-founded concerns of senior Democrats and Republicans that he is the wrong man to be the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Panetta is a seasoned political operative and a proven manager -- both of which would be useful to him as CIA director -- but more is required. Accurate and actionable intelligence is among our most effective tools in fighting against terror threats. The nation has gone more than seven years without a terrorist attack and much of the credit for that lies with the men and women of the intelligence community: in the CIA, FBI, and Defense and Homeland Security departments, among others. Career intelligence officials need a leader they can count on to protect their mission from inappropriate political interference and who would be willing to defend their efforts when, as is often the case, they are attacked based on less than accurate or complete facts. Because of the critical role the intelligence community plays in protecting our nation, the director of the CIA is not a position for on-the-job training. President-elect Barack Obama had a competent, qualified career intelligence official to nominate. John Brennan served for decades at the CIA under numerous directors and in both Democratic and Republican administrations. Just prior to his retirement, Mr. Brennan served as the director of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, the predecessor to the current National Counterterrorism Center. John Brennan had no loyalty to the policies of the Bush administration and in fact at times voiced his disagreement. Mr. Brennan's loyalty was to the mission and role of the intelligence community in protecting our nation. Unfortunately, the incoming administration permitted the vicissitudes of party politics and special interests to derail this nomination. [In a letter to Obama obtained by CNN in early December, Brennan said he was dropping out of consideration for the job because of strong criticism by people who associated his work at the CIA with controversial Bush administration policies on interrogation techniques and the pre-emptive war in Iraq.] . The next CIA director has many important issues to confront. He or she must continue to ensure adequate resources for the intelligence community and continue to build our human and technical intelligence capabilities. The new director will necessarily review detention, interrogation and rendition policies. And at the same time, the CIA director must seek new ways to gain the intelligence advantage on crucial priorities such as terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and a host of regional issues in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Regardless of who becomes the next CIA director, the nation is fortunate that from the deputy director on down, the CIA is run by career officials who will continue to do the nation's business. But they will continue to require the tools necessary to do the job. Before abrogating Bush Administration policies on interrogation and detention, the new CIA director must learn: what is legal; what is effective; and how have these policies been implemented. A new administration may choose to make more limited use of these tools or add additional procedural safeguards. But any decision must be made with caution. Tools that the Justice Department deem legal and the intelligence community determines are effective must not be taken away because they are politically unpopular. The nation and the intelligence community deserve better and must be led with the same courage that they have displayed. President-elect Obama is off to a strong start, taking daily intelligence briefings and asking probing questions. If Mr. Panetta is to be the next CIA director, he will need to earn the trust, confidence and respect of career intelligence officials. Mr. Panetta will need these career intelligence officers to best advise the new president on the CIA capabilities at his disposal to support critical foreign policy and national security objectives. The most important objective will remain protecting American lives. Mr. Panetta is smart and no doubt a quick study. Let's pray if he is confirmed that he is up to the difficult job ahead of him. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frances Townsend.","Frances Townsend: Leon Panetta has had a fine career in government .

This is the stunning aftermath of the largest landslide ever recorded in North America, which saw 165 million tons of earth dropping more than a half mile at a Utah copper mine last month. The natural disaster cut mining production in half at the Bingham Canyon Mine after the April 10 incident. Operators rushed to bring out all workers and equipment from the mine before a massive landslide ripped through the canyon. It started at the mine's northeastern corner and then plummeted to very bottom of the mine, some six-tenths of a mile down. Miraculously, there were no injuries. Landslide brought it down: The devastation at the Bingham Canyon Mine outside of Salt Lake City. The mine's production was cut in half after the natural disaster . According to Kennecott Copper Corp., the . London-based company that operates the mine, more than 165 million tons . of earth had fallen in the landslide. Production at the mine was cut in half due to the disaster. In a message to customers, Kennecott representatives said that shipments of refined copper would continue as normal through April, but that May deliveries would be down and 'thereafter, we do not anticipate the ability to make further shipments for the foreseeable future' Production began at the mines again in late April, but only limited operations. In an effort to reduce costs at the slide-damaged mine, Kennecott has offered 270 workers in their 50s or older a $20,000 early retirement bonus in addition to pension and health insurance benefits. About a third of these workers are planning on taking the retirement, Union officials told the Associated Press May 31. The workers have until Saturday to accept or reject the plan. Aftermath: A mining truck hauls rock from the Kennecott Copper Corp. owned Bingham Canyon Mine after the April 10 landslide . The company, which employed 2,100 employees, had been looking to reduce costs with layoffs ever since a massive landslide hit the Bingham Canyon Mine. According to Jeff Moore, a geological engineer at the University of Utah, this was the largest landslide North America has had to date. 'It's so big it's hard to sense and feel,' Moore told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'We haven't had something of this magnitude since [Montana's] Earthquake Lake' Moore estimates that around 85 million to 92 million cubic yards of rock and dirt, along with copper, gold, silver and molybdenum were moved. Moore explains this amount of earth as being able to fill 21 Great Pyramids of Giza, or if it were spread out over New York City's Central Park, it would be 65 feet deep. More...

fef8e14d363c2f95420ce25f5f61dfb85033de64,"(CNN)The wait is finally over for aviation fanatics wanting to book a flight aboard the Airbus A350 XWB. Qatar Airways, the global launch customer of the A350 XWB, accepted delivery of the commercial plane during a ceremony at Airbus' headquarters in Toulouse, France, on Monday morning. ""It is more than a great day for Airbus,"" the manufacturer's CEO, Fabrice Bregier, told a press conference. ""I would say it was an historic day."" The ""XWB"" in the name means ""extra wide body."" There are three different iterations of the plane being built: the A350-800, the A350-900 and the A350-1000, which seat 270, 314 and 350 passengers, respectively, in three-class seating. Qatar Airways opted for a two-class, 283-seat configuration in its A350-900, offering 36 business class seats and 247 in economy class. In total, the airline has ordered 80 of the airplanes -- 43 A350-900 jetliners and 37 of the longer-fuselage -1000 versions. In a statement, the airline said it expects to induct the first eight production aircraft into its fleet before 2015 year-end. Qatar Airways' new A350-900 will enter into commercial service in January, operating daily flights between its Hamad International Airport hub in Doha, Qatar and Frankfurt, Germany. Minor turbulence delays delivery . Monday's A350 delivery ceremony was originally supposed to take place on December 12, but the airline canceled the event just a few days beforehand. Neither side initially offered an explanation, leaving aviation analysts to speculate on what was behind the hold up. Qatar Airlines CEO Akbar Al Baker told Monday's press conference that the delay was related to one of its suppliers and was not an issue with Airbus. ""It's important to note that the aircraft has been delivered to us one week ahead of schedule, not late,"" he said. Delays are nothing new for Qatar Airways, which also postponed the delivery of three of its A380 superjumbos this year after Al Baker reportedly expressed concerns about the quality of the interior. Airbus chief Bregier described Al Baker as a ""tough customer... you are demanding, sometimes for us a bit too demanding."" He said Qatar's exacting standards had raised the quality of the final product and would make it easier to sell to other carriers. Bregier also used Monday's event to try to draw a line under recent reports that it might pull the plug on A380 production after a fall off in orders. He said such speculation was ""just crazy... after all the efforts we have made."" ""I can tell you the A380 will have a brighter future as the market gets bigger."" The A350's road to flight . The A350 XWB is the first in a family of super-efficient passenger planes Airbus designed to go head-to-head with rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner and 777s. The project for the new jet began in 2006 and was initially criticized by some in the industry, including airlines, for not really advancing the global aviation scene. Being publicly lambasted by some of its largest customers -- one aviation executive called it a Band-Aid reaction to the 787 Dreamliner, while the CEO of Singapore Airlines said the plane just didn't go far enough -- the pressure was on for Airbus to come up with a game changing plane. Much of the aircraft we see today is the result of that pressure. Made from advanced materials, 53% of the A350 XWB frame consists of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer, including Airbus' first carbon-fiber fuselage. As a result, Airbus says the plane will burn 25% less fuel than existing similar size jets. The A350 XWB is powered by two massive Rolls Royce Trent XWB engines, though those who have experienced its test flights say it's remarkable just how quiet the plane actually is. Airbus says passengers will also get a higher quality of air (replaced on the aircraft every two to three minutes), wider cabins and 18-inch-wide seats in economy. As of the end of November, Airbus has received 778 firm A350 orders from 41 airlines. To meet this demand, Airbus says it's ramping up production progressively to reach the planned rate of 10 aircraft per month by 2018. The 2014 list prices for the aircraft are: $260.9 million for the A350-800, $295.2 million for the A350-900 and $340.7 million for the A350-1000. How to spot an A350? With the first of nearly 800 A350s set to hit the skies, plane spotters will be particularly keen to see the sporty new jet in flight. So how will you know when you're looking at one? Key distinguishing features include a streamlined nose and wrap-around cockpit windows. Also, located just ahead of the windshield are the jetliner's nose-mounted pitot tubes, which measure speed, lateral drift and angle of attack during flight, says Airbus. But perhaps the most noticeable feature is the plane's tapered wings, which Airbus says makes the plane faster, more efficient and quieter. These include winglet-type devices -- ""sharklets"" -- that reduce aerodynamic drag.","Qatar Airways is the global launch customer of the A350, accepting delivery of the XWB plane on Monday .

fef8fbdc6a6fd964505007975e62404fd85de7b9,"(CNN) -- Is hip design more important than being green? Technology giant Apple is catching heat on blogs this week for its decision to drop out of an environmental certification program for electronics, called EPEAT. ""In making this move, Apple is signaling that it won't let future design decisions be governed by those seeking to uphold environmental standards,"" Erica Ogg writes for the GigaOm blog network. The decision has some strong ramifications. By U.S. law, 95% of electronics purchases from U.S. federal agencies must be EPEAT-compliant, said Sarah O'Brien, spokeswoman for the group. That probably means Apple desktop and laptop computers can make up a maximum of 5% of federal agencies' purchases, if they can buy them at all. EPEAT doesn't certify tablets or phones, so iPads and iPhones would be OK for the agencies to buy, O'Brien said. San Francisco also has a rule on the books prohibiting the city from purchasing desktop and laptop computers that are not EPEAT-certified, said Christine Falvey, spokeswoman for the mayor. So the city will not be able to purchase Apple desktops and laptops unless Apple gets the green certification again. ""We hope they reconsider and get back on the EPEAT certification list,"" Falvey said, ""and we'll be reaching out to them to see how we can help understand their decision."" Apple hasn't commented on why it removed itself from EPEAT, which is awarded to electronics that are recyclable and energy-efficient. But EPEAT's CEO, Robert Frisbee, says Apple's ""design direction"" may be to blame. ""They said their design direction was no longer consistent with the EPEAT requirements,"" Frisbee told the Wall Street Journal. ""They were important supporters and we are disappointed that they don't want their products measured by this standard anymore."" So what's the design hangup? There's speculation that Apple's new line of ""retina display"" laptops aren't easily recyclable because their batteries are glued to the aluminum case on the computer. ""At the heart of the controversy is the company's newest MacBook Pro with Retina Display, which Apple designed in such a way that it's difficult to disassemble for the sake of repairs, upgrades, and recycling,"" wrote InfoWorld. Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet issued a statement to CNN via e-mail: ""Apple takes a comprehensive approach to measuring our environmental impact and all of our products meet the strictest energy efficiency standards backed by the U.S. government, Energy Star 5.2. We also lead the industry by reporting each product's greenhouse gas emissions on our website, and Apple products are superior in other important environmental areas not measured by EPEAT, such as removal of toxic materials."" She declined to comment further. On its website, Apple says the MacBook Pro is recyclable (PDF): . ""Through ultra-efficient design and the use of highly recyclable materials, Apple has minimized material waste at the product's end of life. In addition, Apple offers and participates in various product take-back and recycling programs in 95% of the regions where Apple products are sold."" In a statement posted on its website last month, EPEAT did not elaborate on Apple's reasons for quitting the standard, which the company and other industry leaders helped create. ""We regret that Apple will no longer be registering its products in EPEAT. We hope that they will decide to do so again at some point in future,"" the group says. Greenpeace ranks Apple in the middle of the pack of tech companies -- behind HP and Dell but ahead of Samsung, Sony and others -- in terms of its sustainability and environmental friendliness.

An elderly man who spent six months in hospital after having his leg amputated was discharged to find his son had spent 50 years' worth of his life savings. Jonathan Hicks, 48, from Newquay, Cornwall, stole almost £28,000 while his Swansea-based 71-year-old father, Leonard, was recovering from losing his leg. He spent the cash on shopping sprees and a holiday to Egypt, only stopping when the cash ran out - leaving the elder Mr Hicks overdrawn for the first time in his life. A court heard the pensioner almost had a heart attack when he discovered his savings had been plundered. Hicks, who was first arrested in December 2013 but initially tried to escape justice by fleeing to Cyprus, was jailed for two years and eight months after admitting theft. It took him just six months to blow the nest egg his father had saved up over more than 50 years - taking out the cash in 177 secret withdrawals. Prosecutor Frank Phillips told the court that Mr Hicks's right leg was amputated in January 2013 and the pensioner was kept in hospital until July due to complications. His son secretly moved into his home in Swansea, South Wales, while he was in hospital, the court heard. 'The pensioner mentioned his bank card PIN number while he was quite agitated during a visit by his son,' Mr Phillips was quoted as telling the court by Wales News Service. 'Hicks then began siphoning off the cash, having located his father's bank card. 'He told his brothers he had withdrawn around £27,000 and said that the social services would take the money and sell his house to pay for care home costs.' After Mr Hicks' release from hospital, his other son Michael took him in a wheelchair to a local branch of Lloyds TSB - where he found he was £300 in the red. Mr Phillips said: 'When he was told that he was overdrawn his son Michael described him as being in a hell of a state. 'He was so upset his son thought that he was going to have a heart attack.' Police were called in to find the younger Hicks had moved back to Newquay, Cornwall. Swansea Crown Court heard he initially tried to blame his brothers and a sister for stealing the cash. But police discovered cash was spent on a holiday to Egypt - with £1,000 changed up for spending money along with car expenses. Hicks was arrested in December 2013. He was released on police bail and fled abroad to Cyprus, but was arrested again when he returned to Britain for the funeral of his step-son. Camel: Police discovered cash was spent on a holiday to Egypt - with £1,000 changed up for spending money . Andrew Evans, defending, said Hicks would 'turn back the clock' if he could. 'The defendant acknowledges that his actions between January and July 2013 were deplorable to say the least,' Mr Evans told the court. 'This was a significant gross breach of trust against a person who, he has to concede, was particularly vulnerable at the time.' Judge Keith Thomas heard Hicks had a history of dishonesty including a conviction in 2007 for money laundering and attempting to obtain money by deception. Sending Hicks to prison, the judge said: 'You plundered your father's bank account at the time when he was extremely vulnerable. 'He was in need of care rather than the dishonest actions that you indulged in.'","Pensioner almost had a heart attack when he found himself £300 in debt .

Despite her leg being amputated, Ms Waters is now back on her horse and hopes to enter the Paralympics . The biker (pictured left before the accident) was thrown from her motorcycle after crashing into a ditch. Her right leg was sliced off after she collided with a telegraph pole and she is now learning how to walk again . The dental nurse, who has been riding horses since the age of two, now hopes to represent the UK at the Paralympics after her grandfather Dennis made her a prosthetic wooden leg. She said: 'When I was lying in hospital I never thought I'd be back riding ever again, I thought it was all over for me. 'I was a very sporty person and I've had to learn to adjust my life around my leg, I think my passion to get back on the horse has helped my recovery. 'I've always loved horses and needed to start riding again, but the NHS were quite slow making a riding leg me so my granddad started work on his own version. 'It doesn't look very pretty but he painted the toenails pink for me just to give it a more girly feel. 'I'm a real fighter but it was tough learning how to walk with my prosthetic, thankfully my family and friends helped me get through it all. 'I don't think I could have done it without them - I'm eternally grateful. 'Sometimes I think they forget I've got a prosthetic leg when we're out walking and I have to ask them to slow down for me to catch up.' Ms Waters (pictured above before the accident) led an active life and was a keen bike and horse rider . She has now been given hope after her grandfather Dennis made her a prosthetic wooden leg to help her get back on her feet. He even went to the effort of painting the toenails on the false limb with pink nail varnish . Ms Waters (pictured with friends after a fundraising run) now leaves a fairly active life and goes to the gym . Ms Waters said she feared she would never walk or ride again after being thrown off her motorcyle in the crash last October. She recalls: 'I remember looking down at the speedometer, I was doing 40mph and looked up to be blinded by the sun. 'Then the handlebars started shaking, I barely had time to think other than to realise the danger I was in and hit the ditch. 'I can't remember hitting the telegraph pole or the supporting wire that took my leg clean off. 'I woke up with my hands by my side facing down without my helmet. I started to panic and tried to stand up to see where it was. 'A lady came over to help me while I sat up, it was then that I realised I didn't have a leg. 'I kept shouting at her, asking where my leg was over and over. 'It was all very surreal, it's weird but there wasn't any pain at all.' Before falling unconscious she managed to give her phone to the woman who came to her aid and asked her to call her family. She was then airlifted by Essex Air Ambulance to St George's Hospital in London and rushed straight into surgery, where doctors decided to amputate to the knee because her wound so full of dirt and gravel. Ms Waters was a keen biker before the crash in October last year in which she was thrown from her vehicle . Her leg was virtually sliced off in the crash but had to be further amputated above the knee due to the injury . Ms Waters has undergone four months of rehabilitation but is now able to walk with the help of prosthetics . Ms Waters also suffered a fractured femur and severe grazing across her body in the crash, leaving doctors no other option than to induce a coma with breathing apparatus to keep her alive. She said: 'I remember waking up to my sister stroking my forehead and mum holding my hand, I was in a state of shock. 'I couldn't talk because there were tubes in my throat, all I could do was look at my missing leg. 'My mum couldn't keep eye contact with me and I panicked so much that I had to be sedated. 'All I kept thinking was how my life would change and how active I used to be, I really struggled to comprehend what happened.' However, after months of rehabilitation she can now walk and ride again and uses the prosthetic limb to help her move forward with her life. She said: 'My life has been completely changed, it's a struggle to put on my prosthetic leg but I still lead a very active life, I got to the gym several times a week and enter the Paralympics. 'I'm not as active as I used to be but I'm still able to do a lot. Ms Waters said she is eternally grateful to her family for their support and help, particularly her grandfather Dennis (together left after the accident), who created her a wooden prosthetic leg to help get her riding again . The dental nurse has joined Riders for the Disabled Association in the hope of breaking through into the Paralympic team. She hopes she will be able to represent the UK at the Games with the help of her false leg . 'At first I blocked the accident out - I don't think I'll ever be able to accept what happened - but I'm learning to live with it and at least I can still walk. 'I've overcame a lot to get where I am now, I keep setting the bar high and pushing myself more and more.' Ms Waters has even joined her local Riders for the Disabled Association in the hope of breaking through into the Paralympic team. She added: 'It's everyone's dream to represent their country doing something they love. 'I'm entering a lot of competitions and hope to be picked for the team. 'Horse riding for Great Britain after everything I've been through would be the best thing imaginable - I have a lot of fun riding and reckon I have a good chance.'","Kerry Waters lost right leg in horrific motorbike crash in October last year .

fef9efc6bb38ccae92f799b0a57f933766a302fb,"It's doubtful Kenny McDowall was even aware of the fierce winds buffeting Murray Park yesterday. Every way the Rangers caretaker manager turns just now, a new storm is brewing. Not three weeks into his new role, the former assistant manager must already feel he’s been occupying the chair for a lifetime. Already devoid of his star player in Lewis Macleod, each day of the January transfer window is a trial. If only that was the sum total of his worries. Kenny McDowall has filled in as caretaker manager at Rangers during turbulent times at the club . Star player Lewis Macleod has left Ibrox, joining Championship high-fliers Brentford . Former Fulham manager Felix Magath is reportedly eyeing the role of technical director at Rangers . In the past week alone, McDowall has seen both Ian Cathro and Felix Magath separately linked with coaching and technical director positions respectively at the club. It can safely be assumed they would not be hired to complement the remainder of the backroom team. More immediately, Rangers are rapidly running out of money. Further loans will be required to see them through January unless unforeseen funds can be raised by selling further players. Sensing the existing board are running out of rabbits to pull from the hat, Dave King, the group known colloquially as the Three Bears and American financier Robert Sarver are manoeuvring independently but with the common goal of usurping the Easdale brothers and Mike Ashley from their positions of power. It would be a brave man to wager on who will be sitting in which seat when the music stops. Somewhere amid the relentless tumult, McDowall has to put a football team on the park that stands half a chance of eating into Hearts’ 13 point lead at the top of the Championship. Little wonder he fielded an enquiry relating to his enjoyment of the job yesterday with a broad grin as opposed to robotically answering in the affirmative. ‘I am not going to kid you on, it is a big job,’ was his diplomatic reply. ‘It is an absolute honour to be in charge of Glasgow Rangers, whether it is caretaker or manager or whatever post. ‘At the moment, I am at the helm and I have to try to get this team winning games and see where that goes. Robert Sarver (right), owner of baseball side Phoenix Suns, has tabled a bid to purchase a stake in Rangers . McDowall has stepped into the role of caretaker manager after the departure of Ally McCoist . ‘In terms of getting easier, I know the boys well and I have worked with them long enough. It is not as if a whole lot has changed and I have been flung into a bunch of guys I don’t know. I know them, they know me and we carry on regardless.’ There was a time under Ally McCoist’s watch where team meetings to enlighten the squad about off-field matters seemed only sensible. Had that continued into 2015, McDowall, you suspect, would be spending more time around a table than on the training field. ‘They are human beings like anyone else,’ the caretaker boss added. ‘They read the papers and get to know what is going on. ‘If you choose to, you can get to know as much as you want to know. When they go out they are professional football players, it is our job to get them concentrating and enjoying their work. ‘That is all we can do to get their minds off it: have a bright week, get them up for it and then come Saturday. ‘In terms of having meetings, I don’t think that does anything apart from highlight there is stuff going on. We go the opposite way if we can.’ McDowall stonewalled the notion of Cathro – the Taysider who is now assistant manager at Valencia – returning to Scotland. Ian Cathro, the assistant manager at Valencia, has been linked with the manager's role at Rangers . ‘I am the caretaker manager at the moment. There is no point me worrying about anything apart from trying to beat Alloa. You could go crazy if you worried about everything that was in the paper.’ Considering the fanfare that previously accompanied the elevation of men to the Rangers post, it’s impossible not to sympathise with McDowall – an individual who didn’t seek to be at the centre of this maelstrom. He’s not been short on sympathy or advice. ‘I have been speaking to a lot of people who I have worked with or know through the years,’ he added. ‘People in the game understand the situation. Listen, I just have to do what I have to do. I have a good group of boys in there and I have to get them going, motivate them as far as I can. ‘Walter (Smith) always used to say to the players when he was in charge that the motivational side has to come from within. A coach or a manger can motivate so far but it has to be self-motivation as well on their behalf to win and to want to achieve. The boys know that.’ If the mere mention of Alloa doesn’t get the blood pumping in the Rangers dressing room then all hope of pipping Hearts to automatic promotion is surely lost. Rangers have failed to beat Alloa in all three of their attempts to do so this season . Three times this season the Ibrox men have set out to defeat Barry Smith’s part-timers and three times they’ve failed - with a capitulation from two goals up in the semi-final of the Petrofac Training Cup the nadir. ‘They let themselves down on the night - and our support who back them wherever we go,’ McDowall lamented. ‘I am sure they will want to fix it for them as well. A bit of personal pride would come into it.’ Stevie Smith can count himself as one of the lucky ones. Suspension and a family matter ensured he only had to watch what passed for a performance at the Indodrill Stadium that night from afar. ‘I was suspended and I wasn’t there,’ he recalled. ‘My brother Christopher was getting married and I was at my mum’s the night before. ‘I saw it was 2-0 to us and then I saw it went to 3-2 and couldn’t believe it myself. These things shouldn’t happen, but it did happen and we’ve got to go and put it right tomorrow. My brother was watching it as well.’ With Hearts still to lose a league game, Rangers’ best hope of seeing their season have a happy ending appears to rest with successfully negotiating the play-offs. Stevie Smith was suspended when Rangers lost 3-2 against Alloa and surrendered a two-goal advantage . Smith acknowledged that, if such a scenario comes to pass, only a radical improvement on the display his side turned in at Easter Road two weeks ago will suffice. ‘They were night and day by far the better team and deserved to beat us convincingly which, from our point of view, isn’t good enough,’ he said. ‘It was so far from good enough it was incredible. You have to take your hat off to them and say they played really well on the day but we never turned up and that’s been the case for the majority of the big games this season. ‘But it’s not a worry to me (playing Hibs in a play-off). It’s quite a bit away and there’s a lot of football to be played and the talk about play-offs or catching Hearts...there’s still a lot to happen. ‘I would like to think we would be playing better by then because everyone knows the performances haven’t been great.'","Financially troubled  Rangers in action against Alloa at the weekned .

Van Gaal's debut campaign has been one decimated by an alarming number of fitness problems to key players. As a result the 63-year-old has been forced to chop and change his formations. Ahead of their Premier League clash with Southampton on Sunday, the Dutchman would not be drawn on whether United will sign any other players in January following the capture of Victor Valdes, but did reveal that Young is their only forced absentee.

Also in action was Daley Blind, who has been out since November with a knee injury, and Marcos Rojo, as Van Gaal oversaw his side's preparations ahead of the visit of Southampton to Old Trafford. Valdes has been training at Carrington for a while as he recovered from a knee injury. And he told the club's official website of his delight at completing a move.

fefa5078872d383d2ea9715a74b19dfd6ad6e705,"(CNN) -- When ""Sorcery"" was demonstrated during the Sony presentation at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2010, it was touted as the quintessential game for the new Move motion controller, showcasing how action can be directed with the new device. Fast forward two years, and ""Sorcery"" doesn't quite live up to expectations of what the Move system could be. Despite some controller issues, it still offers a fun experience though. In it, you step into the role of Finn, a young apprentice in the art of magic who is thrust into battle against the dark forces to save a faerie princess, Erline. The princess, by the way, is a cat with a very long tail. As the game progresses, Finn discovers the ability to cast new spells, which the player casts using the Move controller. A flick of the wrist helps you select your spell and target your enemies. The navigation controller keeps Finn moving while you blast bogeys and assassins with the wand controller. Spell selection is done by holding down the Move button, then making the appropriate gesture to select your spell -- down for an earth spell, counterclockwise for an ice spell and so on. Switching spells is quick and very responsive. Players can also combine spell effects for more powerful attacks. Using an ice spell three times will freeze an enemy and allow them to be shattered with a magic missile. A whirlwind can be created with an air spell, then using a fire spell will spew fire bolts all over the place. However, targeting your opponents gets a little tricky. Players are supposed to aim higher for foes located on a higher level than Finn, but those shots don't seem as consistent as level ones. Unfortunately, the foes on ledges and stairs seem to have no problem raining down shots on you. Also, when multiple foes start attacking, that flicking action can be a bit hard on the arm and shoulder. Take frequent breaks or else suffer the aches later. The player will collect raw materials to make potions that restore health and enhance spell abilities. There is also treasure to be found, and it can be used to buy more materials for those potions. Interestingly, once you create a potion and drink it, you never have to make that potion again. The only potions to be reused repeatedly are health potions, which can be bought or found but not created. The Move controller creates the potions. You are asked to go through the motions of grinding berries, sprinkling dust or pouring a liquid into a cauldron, and then must stir using the wand controller to mix the ingredients together. Despite being a role-playing game, there is no traditional ""leveling up."" Any advancement happens through the potions you create and quaff and the spells you find as the game progresses. The game's dialogue is funny and spirited. There are plenty of quips and one-liners but unfortunately no chances for players to retort. The voice actors for Finn and Erline project real emotions into the characters and help the players feel empathic to their fears, their jokes and their hopes. ""Sorcery"" should be the right game for the Move controller, and in many ways, it is. The action flows well, the story is easy to follow and the characters are noteworthy. It isn't a very deep game, but as an introduction of sorts to Sony's Move tech, it doesn't have to be. ""Sorcery"" is now available for the PlayStation 3, and only uses the Move motion controller, navigation controller and Eye camera. It is rated E 10+ for Everyone 10 years of age and older due to fantasy violence, mild blood, and mild suggestive themes.

fefa7a8f6b26fb893903767f9367ce4c2f350bf7,"Scandal: Ex leader of the Paedophile Information Exchange, Tom O'Carroll, was jailed for child sex offences, and claimed today that 'Harman and co' made no effort to remove him or other members . Fresh questions emerged today about how influential a despised paedophile group were in the civil liberties organisation that Harriet Harman helped run before she became an MP. The former leader of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) said the Labour Deputy Leader and the National Council of Civil Liberties (NCCL) made 'no attempts' to 'kick out' his group. Tom O'Carroll, who has been convicted of a number of child sex offences and was described as 'one of the most infamous perverts on Earth', sat on the NCCL's  gay rights sub-committee in the late 1970s. In the eight years PIE was given affiliate status, O'Carroll said he spoke at the NCCL's 1977 Spring conference, two years after he helped lead a campaign to cut the age of consent to as low as ten. Today he told the BBC that Ms Harman and . Patricia Hewitt, then general secretary of the NCCL, and later a Labour health secretary, 'didn't even try' to remove him or other members because they 'didn't want to rock the boat' to protect their own careers. 'Really they didn't do much to oppose PIE's presence in my view because . there were these other liberal forces, or radical forces, within NCCL,' he told the Today Programme. 'The . support didn't come from Harman and co but it was there. The gay . liberation front was very radical and at that time Harman and Patricia . Hewitt couldn't just kick out PIE, well they could both try but they . didn't even try and the reason they didn't try is they didn't want to . rock the boat because their careers within NCCL depended on them not . rocking the boat too much.' Scroll down for video . Questions remain: Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman arrives in Oxford today for a media convention . Scandal: After six days of questions over her links to a paedophile group, Labour's Harriet Harman has finally expressed regret but not a full apology . He told the programme he never met Ms Harman or her husband Jack Dromey, who was on the NCCL's executive, but he met Ms Hewitt briefly at a conference in Sheffield in 1978. He said: 'I spoke to her when we were just going up a floor or two in a lift and she was somewhat frosty. 'I . said something to her, I think as a pleasantry, and she didn't take it . that way. She said that I'd been rude to her afterwards, which I hadn't . been. 'My impression was that she simply had great distaste for being in the same lift as me.' His comments were rubbished today by people including, Jack Dromey, who said the convicted paedophile has no credibility. Mr Dromey said in a statement: 'Quite simply, no one will believe a man like Tom O'Carroll.' Big players: Harriet Harman once legal officer . of the NCCL, now Labour Deputy Leader and husband Jack Dromey, right, a . Left-wing firebrand, now a shadow minister . O'Carroll was not the only prominent member to find themselves in court charged with appalling sex offences. They . included David Joy, a member of its governing committee, prosecuted for . indecent assault, child rape and possession of 1,129 indecent images of . children. Patricia Hewitt: General Secretary of the NCCL. O'Carroll said he met her in a lift but never met Mr Dromey or Ms Harman . They also . included Andrew Sadler, a prep school teacher and PIE organiser jailed . in Romania for sexual corruption and sex with a minor; Steven Smith, a former . chairman, who was jailed for possessing indecent images; and Morris . Fraser, a co-founder. Harriet Harman belatedly expressed ‘regret’ yesterday that the vile paedophile group was allowed to forge links with the National Council for Civil Liberties. But she still refused to apologise over the NCCL’s extraordinary relationship with the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange. Labour’s deputy leader has repeatedly resisted calls to comment on the Mail’s revelations that she, her MP husband Jack Dromey and former health secretary Patricia Hewitt held key roles in the pressure group that granted ‘affiliate’ status to PIE, a group of predatory paedophiles who openly campaigned to legalise child sex. On Monday evening, Miss Harman dismissed the revelations as a ‘politically-motivated smear campaign’. But hours after a disastrous BBC Newsnight appearance she abruptly changed tack. Faced with questions over why she found it so difficult in the interview to condemn the link with PIE – who wanted the age of consent to be four – Miss Harman issued a statement yesterday through her spokesman, who said: ‘She regrets the existence of PIE and she regrets their involvement with NCCL before she joined, although it was immaterial to her work.’ Document: This is the cover page of the NCCL's submission to Parliament on the 1976 Sexual Offences Act held at the LSE library, which suggests that the age of consent be lowered to 14 . Damning: On page six of the document it is argued that 'a person aged 14 or over should be legally capable of giving consent' and the age of sexual consent cut to ten 'if the child understood the nature of the act' Former culture secretary Tessa Jowell has said Ms Harman had been a . lifelong feminist and 'wasn't chasing wacky causes' during the 1970s. She . told Today: 'Harriet, Jack Dromey, were completely consistent in their . opposition to the vile influence of the Paedophile Information . Exchange.' Ms Jowell said there was 'not one shred of evidence that they gave any comfort to this revolting organisation'. She . added: 'There's no question of post-hoc justification here. The . evidence shows how vigorous Jack Dromey was in his attack on the . Paedophile Information Exchange. 'Harriet's work at NCCL didn't bring her into contact with them at all.' 1978 briefing: The NCCL legal officer Harriet Harman wrote this briefing paper on the Protection of Children Bill, which sought to ban child pornography. She argued that it would lead to an 'increase in censorship' Argument: The second page contains a paragraph saying that a picture should not be considered indecent if the model was not harmed . Recommendations: Miss Harman's briefing went on that the NCCL would argue that the Bill to protect children should be amended . Signed: The Labour Deputy Leader's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered . Jack Dromey has spoken out for the first time and said he is 'proud' of his support for a controversial civil liberties organisation in the 1970s. He also said that he led the fight to stop paedophiles having any influence in it. Mr Dromey said he chose to stay within the civil liberties organisation and led the fight against paedophile attempts to infiltrate it. He said: 'I took them on and defeated them. They published a leaflet denouncing me.' Asked why he didn't simply resign from the NCCL when the Paedophile Information Exchange became involved, he said he believed it was important to stay and fight them. 'I stayed and took them on. 'I'm proud of the stand that I took. They are loathsome. And I'm proud of the stand that I took taking them on. 'So the idea that we should allow these . sinister men, and they were sinister, to infiltrate the NCCL and then we . should walk away - that was not appropriate. 'NCCL did outstanding work. That includes the early foundations of work on children's rights. On women's rights. On gay rights. On trade union rights.' The Mail revealed . that during the 1970s and 80s, the NCCL described PIE – . granted formal ‘affiliate’ status from 1975 to the mid-Eighties – in . glowing terms as ‘a campaigning/counselling group for adults attracted . to children’. AGM minutes: This page reveals how the PIE was represented at an NCCL AGM at the University of Lancaster. Below the list of organisations present is Jack Dromey's name, after he was re-elected to the executive committee of the NCCL in 1977 . The NCCL – . now the respected Liberty – filed a submission to Parliament claiming . that ‘childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult, . result in no identifiable damage’. NCCL lawyers also acted for PIE members who were questioned by police over their disgusting behaviour. Ms Hewitt was general  secretary of . the NCCL from 1974-83. Miss Harman was a newly qualified solicitor when . she became its legal officer in 1978 until 1982, when she entered . Parliament. Mr Dromey sat on the NCCL executive committee from 1970 to . 1979. Police are . investigating PIE as part of Operation Fernbridge, launched after the . Jimmy Savile affair, with one source saying there is evidence that PIE . members were abusing children ‘on an industrial scale’. The . Home Office is also carrying out a ‘thorough, independent . investigation’ into shocking claims that the Labour government of the . 1970s may have helped finance the notorious group. Ever . since December, when The Mail first investigated the NCCL’s links to . the paedophile lobby, we have been sending detailed questions to Miss . Harman, Miss Hewitt and Mr Dromey about their links to PIE and whether . they now regret supporting such a group.","Convicted child abuser Tom O'Carroll led PIE and sat on gay rights committee of National Council of Civil Liberties .

fefab2606119758f1695faa09524bd1ce71eaf96,"His dramatic post-court speech, in which he announced he had saved Casey Anthony's life, drew gasps almost as loud as those that came when the jury found his client not guilty of murdering her young daughter. It was a rather bold statement to make by defence lawyer of the moment Jose Baez, who has been called 'the luckiest man in America' by one lawyer. Baez was chosen by Casey Anthony to represent her 'at random', court tapes revealed, after she heard his name mentioned by other prison inmates. It was a choice many questioned at the time - both among her family and in the legal profession. Scroll down for video . Delighted: Man of the moment Jose Baez pulls off the victory of his career . Speaking to the Miami Herald, Robert Jarvis, a lawyer and law professor at Nova Southeastern University, echoed the thoughts of many when he called Baez: 'The luckiest man in America.' In taking on the job of attempting to clear Anthony of murder charges related to the death of her two-year-old daughter Caylee, Baez went from being a small-time local lawyer to the defence attorney in the most high-profile case in America. Jeff Ashton, one of the three . prosecutors who led the case against Anthony, announced tonight that he . will retire at the end of the week. Mr Ashton, 53, has prosecuted for the . Orange-Osceola State Attorney's Office for 30 years. His reputation and . experience was in stark contrast to that of Jose Baez, Anthony's lead . defence attorney, who was admitted to the Florida Bar only three years . ago. In 2008, when the decision went public, Richard Hornsby, the president of the Central Florida Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers, was shocked. 'I first said, ""Jose who?"" Hornsby told ABC News. 'I had no idea who he was.' Baez, 42, a Navy veteran, took almost a decade simply to start practising as a professional lawyer. Despite graduating from law school in 1997, he was was perennially denied entry to the Florida bar until 2005 - because he refused to pay child support to his former wife or secure life and health insurance for his teenage daughter. Hand in hand: Baez clings tight to Anthony as they await today's verdict . Victory for them both: Casey and Baez hug after she is found not guilty today . Relief: Casey Anthony clings on and cries as Baez looks proudly ahead . He had previously declared himself bankrupt and defaulted on loans, according to an order by the Supreme Court of Florida. As a result, he was barred from the bar for eight years, because, according to the Florida Supreme Court, the financial marks on his name showed 'a lack of respect for the rights of others and a total lack of respect for the legal system, which is absolutely inconsistent with the character and fitness qualities required of those seeking to be afforded the highest position of trust and confidence recognised by our system of law.' 'It kind of happened at random in booking. 'I . heard a couple of people talking about attorneys... His name came up and . I said if he's good, can you do me a favour and pass my name along' Casey Anthony on why she hired Baez . The decision to hire Baez was also criticised by Anthony's family. In jail house tapes from July 2008 played to the court, Lee Anthony, Casey's brother, warned her to switch attorneys. Understand your rights in this... If at any point you want to change jockeys in this horse race, you can do it…it's as simple as you reaching out to anyone in the Corrections Department…and make it known on what you want to do,' he told his sister. Her father George Anthony added: 'I just, I hope that the compassion that he says that he has is being . genuine…I hope he's not building a reputation for himself.' When Lee probed her on how she came to hire Baez, Casey explained: 'It kind of happened at random in booking. 'I heard a couple of people talking about attorneys...His name came up and I said if he's good, can you do me a favour and pass my name along…It was an inmate and there was three other people that confirmed it.' In court, Baez faced much media criticism for what appeared to be a series of bold and dangerous moves, which could have scuppered his defence case. He was slammed, in particular, almost daily by notorious host Nancy Grace for his choice of argument in court and for 'relishing in the spotlight' outside of it, supposedly using the case as an opportunity for fame. In his opening statements, Baez stunned onlookers by claiming his client had lied all along about what had happened to her daughter. Furious: Nancy Grace has continually argued against Baez's tactics in court . She was no longer arguing that a nanny had taken her for a month before her disappearance was reported but that a tragic accident in her parents' swimming pool led to them attempting to cover up little Caylee's death. Baez then told the court she had lied . because of psychological problems that stemmed from Casey having been . sexually abused by her father - a claim he completely denied. 'You can't say they won because of Jose Baez but I guess you can say they won in spite of Jose Baez' Nancy Grace on the verdict . Once the new story was established, Baez essentially backed himself into a corner, critics argued. The . only witness who could corroborate these bold claims was Casey herself . and legal experts almost always warn against bringing one's client to . the stand. As it transpired, the claims were never backed up and Casey did not give evidence. Baez . was heavily criticised throughout the case by notorious host Nancy . Grace and was labelled 'incompetent' on one of her shows. Speaking . with defence attorney Raymond Giudice about testimony instigated by . Baez that Caylee's remains may have been tampered with by woodland . animals, Grace said: 'You know what? Maybe it was a dingo dog or . Sasquatch or Bigfoot or a martian! 'You . know what? I really think -- you know, I see you laughing, but here`s . the deal.. The defence can`t laugh. They've done it now. They can sit . there and laugh in open court. What were they thinking?  A coyote did . it?' Different: Baez was criticised for using so many posters and charts in court . Giudice responded: 'We`re seeing is an entire team, not just Mr Baez, their incompetency.' After the not guilty verdict was announced today, Grace said rather ungraciously: 'You can't say they won because of Jose Baez but I guess you can say they won in spite of Jose Baez.' Baez had been practising as a lawyer for just three years when he was booked by Anthony. In his highest profile case before the Anthony trial, he defended a Nilton Diaz, a man accused of killing the granddaughter of a boxer. After Diaz was convicted of manslaughter, the client filed a . motion arguing that Baez was a defective attorney, although his motion was denied. While he was waiting to be admitted to the bar he worked with two bikini businesses - Bon Bon Bikinis and Brazilian-Bikinis.com, which are both now inactive. He also worked for not for profit organisations which fought to prevent domestic violence and child abuse. While his profile has soared since the Anthony trial began, Baez's financial troubles have not ceased. 'Saved a life': Baez addresses the media after the historic result . His home was in foreclosure last . year, according to reports, and it is unclear how he was paid to . represent Anthony, although money from sales of pictures and footage of . Caylee are thought to have contributed. 'He's . a guy with a colourful and complicated past and a very confusing . present,' Robert Jarvis, a lawyer and professor at Nova Southeastern . University Law Center told ABC News during the case. 'His courtroom demeanour leaves you with a sense that this is a guy who is in over his head. 'He's really flying by the seat of his pants. From his very confusing open, from the way he's been cross examining witnesses, at this point, you really have to wonder what his strategy is.' Despite all the criticism, however, today's result is an undoubted milestone success for the attorney - which is perhaps why he so basked in the moment. Turnaround: Baez won despite claims he took the job for fame . As the clerk of the court read the verdicts, Anthony hugged Baez and soon after began to cry. Later, as the judge spoke to the jury, she could be seen mouthing . 'thank you' to him, before the whole defence team hugged in tears like a victorious sports team as the . session ended. In a bizarre speech given after the case in both English and Spanish, Baez appeared shaken with emotion as he shamelessly declared that his defence had ‘saved a life’. He told the media he was ‘very happy for Casey. I’m ecstatic for her and I want her to be able to grieve and grow and somehow get her life back together’ but spent much of the speech focussed on how the moment felt for him. He used to opportunity to speak out against Casey’s ‘trial by media’ and the death penalty, which he labelled ‘disgusting’, before saying: ‘I want to thank everyone who stood behind me and supported me throughout this time.’ The speech then reached its climax as, holding back tears, Baez declared he was especially proud that when he went home this evening his daughter ‘will ask me what did you do today and I can say I saved a life.’ Watch the videos .","'I saved a life' says Casey lawyer .

fefb0302ad8a8106f40a221d5efa2838e580f37f,"A day after he was heckled by new New York Police Department officers at an academy graduation ceremony, the city's mayor sat down with union heads in a bid to clear the air between the two sides. Mayor Bill de Blasio was joined by Police Commissioner William Bratton on Tuesday afternoon at the Police Academy in Queens for the private meeting with union heads. De Blasio had requested the meeting with the heads of all five police unions following several displays of disrespect against him by officers in the wake of the shooting deaths of officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. Scroll down for video . A day after he was heckled by new New York Police Department officers at an academy graduation ceremony, Mayor de Blasio sat down with union heads in a bid to clear the air between the two sides . A rift between de Blasio and much of the NYPD's rank and file has widened recently following the two murders on December 20 and City Hall's response to protests over police conduct. Union leaders have blamed the mayor for fostering an anti-NYPD atmosphere and said it contributed to the officers' deaths. Present was one of the mayor's harshest critics Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association chief Pat Lynch whose son, Kevin, graduated from the academy on Monday. He has accused de Blasio of having 'blood on his hands' over the two deaths at the hands of Ismaaiyl Brinsley. The Democratic mayor was elected last year on promises of keeping crime low while reforming the NYPD. Meanwhile, police unions have been seeking new contracts. Another union leader, Captains Endowment Association President Roy Richter, has informed officers not to turn their backs on the mayor at the upcoming funeral of Officer Liu. Among the NYPD union leaders that de Blasio met with on Tuesday was Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association chief Pat Lynch, left, and Captains Endowment Association President Roy Richter, right . 'In this forum the appropriate protest is not a sign or turning away from mourners, or people the family has asked to speak, but rather cold, steely silence,' he wrote in a memo to his membership on Tuesday. Three days ago, dozens of police officers showed their disdain for de Blasio byturning their backs to a video monitor as the Mayor spoke at the funeral of Liu's partner, Rafael Ramos. Richter says there can be no repeat of this at Liu's wake and funeral this weekend, reports the New York Daily News. 'In the coming days and weeks you will be looked upon by many for guidance, leadership and advice at a time when many of our peers and officers under our care are deeply angry,' he wrote. 'Unfortunately, but understandably, this anger provided visual displays of back-turning at the funeral of Police Officer Ramos that caused pain for his loved ones.' NYPD officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot while on duty in Brooklyn just over a week ago, claim sources within the department . De Blasio angered police by expressing sympathy for protesters demonstrating against a Staten Island grand jury's decision not to prosecute a white cop for killing Eric Garner with a chokehold. NYPD officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot while on duty in Brooklyn just over a week ago, claim sources within the department. An unnamed supervisor told the New York Post on Monday that his officers are writing significantly fewer summonses and 'probably only making arrests when they have to - like when a store catches a shoplifter.' 'I'm not writing any summonses. Do you think I'm going to stand there so someone can shoot me or hit me in the head with an ax?' one cop told the Post. 'I'm concerned about my safety. I want to go to home to my wife and kids.' A union mandate requiring that two patrol cars respond to all police calls – introduced following the shootings of Officers Ramos and Liu – has also contributed to slower response times to non-emergencies. The PBA's directive is creating a manpower shortage that is delaying response times to crimes such as burglaries and car crashes to as much as four hours, according to the paper. Mayor de Blasio was booed on Monday by the newest members of the NYPD as he delivered a speech at the academy graduation ceremony. Several boos could be heard at Madison Square Garden as de Blasio took the podium in front of 884 newly-minted cops. Mayor de Blasio ignored the boos and thanked the new recruits for their service to the city of New York . At least one cadet could be heard shouting 'traitor!' Then, when de Blasio remarked that the new officers would be confronted with problems they didn't make, someone from the crowd shouted, 'You created them!' The heckler was met with applause and cheering. The incident shows that mistrust has taken hold even among the NYPD's newest officers. On Saturday, hundreds of cops turned their backs on de Blasio as he spoke at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos, one of two NYPD cops gunned down by a fanatic who was enraged about recent police brutality cases - including the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner. The Mayor has come in for sharp criticism from the police union after expressing sympathy for protesters who took to the streets in the wake of a grand jury's failure to indict the NYPD cop who allegedly put Garner in a chokehold. At least one of the new NYPD academy graduate shouted 'traitor!' as the mayor took the podium in front of 884 newly minted cops . Tense: The Mayor (left) and NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton (second from left) stood on stage with police union president Patrick Lunch (second from right) - who has said de Blasio has 'blood on his hands' Thousands of friends and family members filled Madison Square Garden - along with the nearly 900 recruits . In a speech following the grand jury decision, de Blasio, whose children are half-black, recounted how he told his teenage son Dante how to deal with the police and that he might be discriminated against by the NYPD. Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said de Blasio had 'blood on his hands' in the death of Ramos and his partner Officer Wenjian Liu, who were assassinated on December 20 as they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said on Sunday that the strife between de Blasio and the rank-and-file officers is likely to last 'for some time.' City Hall and the Patrolman's Benevolent Association are in the midst of rancorous contract negotiations that are set to go to arbitration - further exacerbating the strife. The Mayor and Lynch - his most outspoken critic - came face-to-face on Monday when they posed together for a photo for an award that the PBA gives out for the top squad sergeant from the graduating class. Lynch's son Kevin is among the graduating class.","The mayor sat down with union heads on Tuesday in a bid to clear the air between the two sides .

The Curiosity rover currently scanning the Red Planet has not detected any methane, a gas that is produced by living things. Since landing in Gale Crater last year, every morning and evening the car-size probe has analysed Mars' air and scanned it with a tiny laser in search of the greenhouse gas. Scroll down for video . Disappointment: The Curiosity rover has scanned Mars for methane every day but has not found any, which probably means it does not support life . Not finding it means that it is unlikely that microbes . capable of producing the gas are living below the planet's surface, . scientists said today. NASA had high hopes that the rover would inhale methane after . orbiting spacecraft and Earth-based telescopes detected plumes of the . gas several years ago. On Earth, most of the gas is a by-product of . life, spewed when animals digest or plants decay. 'If you had microbial life somewhere on Mars that was really healthy and . cranking away, you might see some of the signatures of that in the . atmosphere,' said mission scientist Paul Mahaffy of NASA's Goddard Space . Flight Center. During Curiosity's first eight months on the red planet, it probed . the air during the day and at night as the season changed from spring to . summer. Journey: Curiosity has traveled around one mile in the past year. This map shows where the rover has been between landing at 'Bradbury Landing' on August 6 last year and August 1 . 'Every time we looked, we never saw it,' said Christopher . Webster, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who led the research . published online in the journal Science. Webster said while the . result was 'disappointing in many ways,' the hunt for the elusive gas . continues. While methane is linked to living things, it can also be made . by non-biological processes. Mars today is a hostile place - . extremely dry and constantly bombarded by radiation. Billions of years . ago, the planet boasted a thicker atmosphere and possible lakes. Scientists generally agree that nothing can exist on the Martian surface . at present since it's too toxic. If there are living things on Mars, . scientists theorize they're likely underground. Just because . Curiosity didn't detect methane near its landing site doesn't mean the . gas is not present elsewhere on the planet, said Bill Nye, chief . executive of the Planetary Society, a space advocacy group. At work: Curiosity spends its time analysing all elements of Mars using a series of lasers and probes - but some results have been disappointing fo scientists on Earth . 'Suppose . you're an alien coming to Earth and you landed in the Four Corners . area, would you feel as if you've explored the Earth?' he said. Several . years ago, scientists became excited at the prospect of . methane-producing microbes after Michael Mumma of NASA's Goddard Space . Flight Center noticed a mysterious belch of methane from three regions . in Mars' western hemisphere. Mumma, who had no role in the latest study, said he stood by his observations. Earlier . this month, Curiosity reached its first rest stop in its long trek . toward Mount Sharp, a mountain rising from Gale Crater near the equator. The rover will take monthly readings of the Martian atmosphere during . the road trip, expected to last almost a year. Curiosity previously . found evidence of an ancient environment that could have once been . suitable for microscopic life.

fefbadfd98e20a6896fa8d17e60bc2e964736567,"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Energy prices in Britain will rise unless urgent action is taken to prevent Russia holding countries to ransom by cutting off gas supplies, a minister has warned. Energy Secretary Ed Davey warned aggression from Russian President Vladimir Putin could quickly force up costs for families in the UK. Energy security will be high on the agenda of a meeting of the G7 meeting in Rome early next month. Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) has claimed it is 'impossible' European countries will stop buying Russian gas, but British Energy Secretary Ed Davey urged action to improve energy security . A quarter of Europe’s gas comes from Russia, half of which passes through Ukraine which has been the focus of mounting tensions after the Crimea region was annexed by Moscow. Last week President Putin insisted it was ‘impossible’ for Europe to stop buying gas from Russia. In Britain there is growing concern about the impact of moves by Russia to use gas supplies to increase its stranglehold on the region. Ministers from Britain will join counterparts from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US to draw up a plan to speed up alternative energy supplies. The G7 talks on May 5 and 6 will examine how to increase gas storage, find alternative supplies and reopen nuclear power stations which have been closed down. Mr Davey said: ‘It can’t be right for Russia to hold individual countries to ransom. This is an issue we cannot allow to go off the table. ‘There have been at least two, if not three, occasions in recent times when Russia has sought to use its energy superpower status in quite an aggressive manner,’ he told The Times. ‘If this [the current Ukraine crisis] goes away, who is to say it won’t happen again? Putin wrote his Phd about the possibility of Russia using energy to reassert its political status.’ Tensions have mounted over Russian gas supplies to Ukraine, and the wider impact on the rest of Europe . He insisted that the EU should show ‘solidarity’  with countries at risk from Russian aggression and show ‘we mean business’. ‘If, because of Russian action, EU gas prices go up, that affects consumers and businesses here very quickly. Gas and energy goes around the world, so we are interrelated. ‘We have got to look at everything, from more diversified supplies of gas, whether it’s from the US, from shale, or helping other countries who are demanding a lot of gas now but who needn’t. Maybe Japan will turn on some of its reactors.’ Russian Vladimir Putin . However, President Putin has been dismissive of the idea that countries will reduce their demand for Russian gas. In an interview last week, he said: ‘Of course, everyone is taking care about supply diversification. There, in Europe, they talk about increasing independence from the Russian supplier... It's just like we begin to talk and take action towards independence from our consumers.' 'We sell gas in European countries which have around 30-35 percent of their gas balance covered by supplies from Russia. Can they stop buying Russian gas? In my opinion it is impossible.' EU Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger also opposes cutting back gas ties with Russia. In an interview with Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Mr Oettinger conceded there is a risk of Russia cutting supplies to Ukraine, an important transit country, over unpaid bills. But he added: ‘We agree that the gas sector should not be a priority in possible economic sanctions — whether on the European or Russian side.’ He added that he is ‘against reducing or even breaking off gas relations with Russia in the coming years. However, we must pursue our diversification strategy’.","G7 countries to hold talks on how to improve energy security .

fefcde14475058e901b9343b53493e599e75e69e,"(CNN) -- Greece may have given us the word democracy and many of the principles of civil society. But now it is ""the sick man of Europe,"" and the people of other European democracies are asking whether it's worth saving with billions more dollars of their money. Put crudely, their argument is this: So what if Greece slides ignominiously out of the eurozone? Goodbye Greece... In continental terms, Greece is peripheral. It doesn't sit on reservoirs of oil, and it relies on agriculture and tourism as money-earners. It accounts for just 5% of the European Union's economic output. With the Cold War long over, its strategic position on the edge of the Balkans is not as important as it was. Second, critics question whether Greece has the will or capacity to stay within the eurozone. In last Sunday's elections, the main Greek parties -- those that had promised to swallow the medicine doled out by the European Union and International Monetary Fund -- were trounced at the polls. Thursday, a third political leader was invited to try to form a government. Greek commentators predict no stable coalition is likely -- and new elections probable, just as a further $15 billion of austerity measures are due. Two weeks ago, the governor of Greece's Central Bank, George Provopoulos, warned that unless the country stayed the course, there could be ""a disorderly regression, taking the country back several decades and eventually driving it out of the euro area and the European Union."" A majority of Greek -- some 70% -- tell pollsters they want the country to remain in the eurozone. But a substantial minority have just voted for parties that oppose what they see as austerity imposed by Berlin. They believe the medicine is actually making the situation worse. This year, the Central Bank forecasts the economy will shrink by 5%, after a 7% contraction last year. That means fewer jobs, less tax revenue and more difficulty meeting debt obligations. Third, is the endless bailout smart economics? Or does it just perpetuate the crisis, as new debt replaces old? A confidential analysis by the IMF, European Central Bank and European Commission in February projected that Greek debt would still amount to 129% of GDP in 2020 and could be as high as 160%. The analysis, obtained by Reuters in February, estimated Greece would need some $175 billion in financing over the next two years. Some argue that so long as Greece uses the euro as its currency, it will never become competitive. Research by investment bank Goldman Sachs concluded Greece needed a real depreciation in its exchange rate of a whopping 30% to restore competitiveness. Compare its situation to that of Iceland, which after a financial meltdown in 2008 thanks to its over-stretched banking sector, went cold turkey with a 40% devaluation of its currency and let bank creditors whistle in the wind. Now it's started growing again, albeit modestly. U.S. economist Kenneth Rogoff has argued that Athens should be granted a sabbatical from the eurozone while remaining in the European Union, allowing it reintroduce the drachma at a deep discount to the euro and making its tourism industry wildly popular. Hans-Werner Sim, head of German think tank Ifo, agrees. The money being showered on Greece to keep it in the eurozone would be better spent lubricating its departure, he says. ""The drachma will immediately depreciate, and the situation will stabilize very quickly. After a short thunderstorm, the sun will shine again,"" he told German magazine der Spiegel. Fourth, beyond the discouraging arithmetic, some argue that the Greek state is too dysfunctional to cope with its massive obligations. Greece has a tax system that barely works, recalcitrant labor unions and extensive graft. The latest corruption league table from Transparency International ranks Greece as 80th - along with El Salvador. ""For decades the political elite, mired in corruption and rent-seeking, has followed the path of wasteful spending and patronage,"" wrote Kostas Bakoyannis, the mayor of Karpenisi, in the Wall Street Journal last month. Greece hasn't privatized a single, state-owned industry despite repeated promises to do so. Its social fabric is fraying and it has a growing problem with political violence. Add to that, now, an unstable political order. And finally, if Greece is unable to get its house in order and uncertainty persists, the dreaded contagion effect will rear its head again. It's a truism that markets hate uncertainty, and for the last year Greece has delivered it in weekly installments. The never-ending melodrama could worsen the psychological climate for other ""olive-belt"" members of the eurozone. Negotiations on restructuring Greek sovereign debt have already left international investors wary of buying other south European debt. According to the Financial Times last month, investors have withdrawn $130 billion from Europe's sovereign bond markets over the past two years. On the other hand... The opposing argument is that a ""disorderly default"" or even a managed exit by Greece would have far-reaching consequences for Europe -- none of them good -- and misreads the Greek mood. Pierpaolo Barbieri, Ernest May Fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center, has written extensively about Europe's financial crisis. ""Greek voters have turned against the old duopoly of PASOK and New Democracy,"" he says, referring to the dominant parties of the past 30 years. ""They are tired of crisis. That doesn't mean they are against being part of the eurozone. They realize their savings would be wiped out if a devalued drachma took the place of the euro and that Greek banks would collapse. So it's important to separate the weakness of the existing political parties from the issue of the bailouts and the eurozone."" Second, there is no playbook for leaving the single currency, no rules governing expulsion. It was just never envisaged. A new Greek government, by persistently defaulting on debt repayments, might effectively vote itself out of the eurozone, but the process would be messy. Greek companies that take advantage of the single market would be badly affected. ""Any announcement of Greece's departure would wreck havoc in the markets. If Greeks elected someone who wanted to pursue this path, it would be impossible to get back in at a later date,"" Barbieri told CNN. In addition, he says, there is no guarantee that excising Greece from the eurozone will relieve pressure on other members. It might simply refocus anxiety on the next most vulnerable state. ""If Greece were to fall out, what would that say to Portugal, Italy, Spain and Ireland? There would be a danger to the whole European construction, including the single market. The Germans often say ""If the euro fails then Europe fails"" -- and project Europe has been at the core of German foreign policy for half a century."" Italy, Spain and Portugal are in the middle of painful restructuring; just this week the Spanish government announced it would have to step in to rescue the country's third largest bank. The worst-case scenario: that the whole concept of an ""ever-closer union"" toward which Europe has been striving will unwind, one state at a time. ""Europe will have difficulty forming a federation, if its first action is to jettison countries that are unable to make ends meet,"" wrote commentator Barbara Spinelli in the Italian newspaper la Repubblica. Let them eat carrots . Is there a way to muddle through? Maybe. But it will require a tilt from ""austerity"" toward ""growth"" to persuade the Greeks that their suffering will not be endless. The basic choice may remain bailout or bankruptcy, but the bailout can be sweetened, as a spokesman for EU Economics Commissioner Olli Rehn hinted Tuesday. ""We can do lots to assist Greece, and we are doing so. Our member states, our taxpayers in other European member states of the euro area, are providing this solidarity,"" he said. Concrete action must follow, says Barbieri. ""Europe needs to show the Greeks that they have reason to hope by staying the course, that it won't just be pain and more pain. There have to be measures to help growth, such as European investment projects in infrastructure and help for small and medium businesses starved for funding, which can be achieved through the European Investment Bank. The ECB should continue to help Greek banks, so as to start lending again."" Next year, Angela Merkel will be seeking a third term as German chancellor. If she gets one, analysts say, she may have greater freedom to tilt toward growth. ""It would be a positive development if Francois Hollande [the newly elected French President] could hasten this development and create 'rewards' for reforming countries, so as to remind European electorates the monetary union is not a 'suicide pact,' says Barbieri. It may be that even with a rancorous political atmosphere, mass unemployment and street protests, Greece is actually making progress. If (yes, it's a large if) the next round of public spending cuts goes through Greece get close to achieving what's called a primary balance, its revenue will pay for its spending. According to the Central Bank, the economy may finally stop shrinking in 2013. But 2013 seems a long way off, and these are the first tentative steps toward convalescence. Anyone who has seen the movie ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" will recall what happened to the man who insisted he wasn't dead yet.","Greece doesn't sit on oil reservoirs; it relies on agriculture, tourism as money-earners .

fefcf4dbaea0a8f6569e9402e50ddbf2df04395e,"(CNN) -- Ask Gavin MacLeod about virtually anybody, and he'll have something nice to say. Cary Grant? ""To look like him for 10 minutes."" Gregory Peck? ""What a gentleman."" Frank Sinatra? ""One of the great moments of my life, getting to shake that man's hand."" Except Bette Davis. Oh, MacLeod's not angry. But in his new memoir, ""This Is Your Captain Speaking"" (written with Mark Dagostino and out Tuesday ), he has an amusing story about inviting Davis to dinner during the height of his early '80s ""Love Boat"" fame. The Hollywood grande dame proved to be less than a gracious guest. Davis argued with another guest, upset MacLeod's wife and, afterward, insulted her hosts in the newspaper. But even with Davis, MacLeod looks on the sunny side. ""We got a good story and a good laugh out of it,"" he writes in the book. MacLeod is a happy guy. His enthusiasm and generous spirit run through his new memoir like bright threads. In the midst of recollections about his early stage career, his years as a character actor in countless TV shows and his well-known turns on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""The Love Boat,"" he'll slow down the recollections to pay tribute to former co-stars and little-known colleagues with a ""Wow!"" and ""Can you imagine?"" He drops exclamation points frequently, still stunned that his life has worked out so well. ""It's been a great, great ride,"" MacLeod, 82, said in a phone interview. ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"": Where are they now? Sure, the ride's had a few bumps for MacLeod, born Allan See in Westchester County, New York. He lost his father when he was 13. He suffered through years of alcoholism, which led to the end of his first marriage -- a tale he tells without self-pity in the book. ""I was ugly when I drank,"" he writes. ""The fighting was miserable, and very much my fault."" Until finally breaking through in his late 30s as ""MTM's"" even-keeled newswriter Murray Slaughter, he had a steady but unexceptional career as a character actor. He got his start on stage in the drama ""A Hatful of Rain"" and later attracted notice in Los Angeles for playing a drug dealer in a play called ""The Connection,"" which led to roles as villains in such shows as ""Hawaii Five-O."" It was Murray -- and then Capt. Merrill Stubing on ""The Love Boat,"" through which he became a spokesman for Princess Cruises -- that established MacLeod's on-screen good-guy bona fides. He has found strength in his Christian faith and in his long marriage to his wife, Patti. CNN spoke to MacLeod by phone from his home in Southern California. The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview: . CNN: Acting can be a very challenging business. How do you stay upbeat? Gavin MacLeod: You get turned down more than you get accepted, so you get used to that negativity. It's just part of the life. A lot of hope goes into being an actor, especially when you're young, and especially not having any hair. CNN: Tell me about that. MacLeod: Being bald at a young age turned out to be an asset for me. When I came out to Hollywood in 1957, I started doing shows at Desilu. I'd do two shows in a week. I'd do one with my hair on, then take my hair off, put on a suit and have another little dialogue change and be the head of a mob. I got a lot of training that way because of being bald. CNN: You played a lot of heavies and small character roles until ""Mary Tyler Moore."" MacLeod: I really did. What surprises me is how people know about your career who you've never met. I was on (a cruise) one time, and one guy asked, ""How is Maisie?"" and I said, ""Who is Maisie?"" and he said, ""In 'Operation Petticoat,' the tattoo on your chest of the naked girl."" You become a part of people's lives in ways you'll never know. CNN: Did you feel like taking ""MTM"" was a risk? MacLeod: Not at all. I had worked with Mary before, and she and (producer) Grant (Tinker), her husband, had seen me do a lot of plays on the West Coast. I knew her a little bit from working with her on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" And the script was so good. CNN: They wanted you for Lou Grant. (Ed Asner eventually played the role.) MacLeod: Lou Grant was wonderful, but I wouldn't believe myself in that role. But Murray, I thought I could do something with him. That's something I tell actors when I talk to them. If you have an instinct about something, follow that instinct. If I didn't risk saying (to the producers), ""I really like Murray Slaughter. I think I can do something with it."" ... They had to readjust their thinking, because he wasn't the lead role. And that was the beginning of a wonderful seven-year relationship. CNN: You reveled in the character of Murray Slaughter, but Ted Knight wrestled with the character of Ted Baxter. People confused the actor with the fake anchorman. MacLeod: Well, his character was so vivid. He was so funny. Grant Tinker used to come up in the audience, even by himself, to watch rehearsals, and roar at Ted. (The) concept was based on a lot of different people. There was a big guy named George Putnam. He was the biggest newscaster on the West Coast. I did a Christmas parade, and he was one of the guests. He was riding on a horse, and I was in a car, and he says, ""GAVIN! I'M THE REAL TED BAXTER!"" And he was so proud of it. (But) Ted had that image, and it wore on him. Finally he did get to have ""Too Close for Comfort"" and ""The Ted Knight Show."" CNN: It must be tough. You've had such indelible roles that people may find it hard to think of you as something besides Murray or Capt. Stubing. MacLeod: It becomes a part of people's lives. The thing about Stubing, I tried to make him as likable as I could. He was written differently -- he was written as a stern person. But we realized if you're going to have a series that's going to run, people don't want to see that kind of figure week after week. So we started to change him and tap into me more. That's how he became the caring man, the father figure. CNN: ""Mary"" was beloved by critics. Not so for ""The Love Boat."" MacLeod: The critics hated our show. But I remember when we went to church one Sunday. A lady stopped me, and said, ""Aren't you the captain?"" I say, ""Yes."" She says, ""I love the messages you give us, because they're covered with cotton candy."" What a great phrase that is. And writing on that level is very hard to do. CNN: What lessons do you hope people draw from the book? MacLeod: Never give up. Don't be afraid to risk. And if you have a dream, go for it. Don't let anybody step on your dream. You have one life; you want to make the most of it.","Gavin MacLeod has new memoir, ""This Is Your Captain Speaking""

fefd1551edd2d395d4c8310b635e8bb1c1bb6d5f,"London (CNN) -- ""After the storm of a life lived in the heat of political controversy, there is a great calm."" And so it seemed inside St. Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday as more than 2,300 guests from 170 countries stilled their quiet chatter and waited, silently, for the coffin of Margaret Thatcher to enter. Those words from the Right Rev. Richard Chartres, Bishop of London, in many ways summed up the mood within: This was a farewell to a stateswoman and Britain's pioneering first female prime minister but also to a very human mother and grandmother now gone to her final rest. The domed white marble splendor of St. Paul's, Christopher Wren's masterpiece, only served to remind those within of how insignificant even the greatest of leaders is in the end. Rewriting history: How UK might have been without Thatcher . The coffin's solemn arrival was signaled to those waiting inside by the muffled tone of the cathedral clock tolling the hour. Far from the fierce political debate and fervent protests that raged in Thatcher's life -- and indeed in the nine days since her death -- the coffin was carried quietly in by uniformed members of the armed forces. Draped in a Union flag and topped with a white flower arrangement, it was placed carefully on a bier directly before the guests of honor at the service, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. They sat across the aisle from Thatcher's children, Mark and Carol; and her grandchildren, Michael and Amanda; and next to serving Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife. Thatcher: Revered and reviled, in death as in life . A ceremonial mourning sword lay on a red-covered table before the queen, carried in by the Lord Mayor of London. The royals' red velvet-covered chairs had been the last to be filled, as steadily the cathedral filled to its capacity. Those who'd taken their places in the tight-packed rows of seats behind and to either side included men in formal military uniform, adorned with gold braid and medals, cardinals with their distinctive red caps, women in elaborate black hats and foreign dignitaries, some in dark suits, others in more distinctive traditional dress. Live blog: Funeral of Margaret Thatcher . Grey hair was much in evidence, and men outnumbered women -- as was the case by a much greater margin when Thatcher was in office. After all, when she entered Parliament in 1959, she made up part of only 4% who were women. From time to time during the ceremony, sunlight poured through the windows of the cathedral to glint off the gold mosaic tiles and gilded carvings below the frescoed dome, lit also by gleaming candelabra. There was no sign within the grand cathedral walls of the tight security outside, with crowds of supporters and a few pockets of protesters kept under the watchful gaze of some 4,000 police officers. Welcoming the congregation, the Very Rev. David Ison, dean of St. Paul's -- who himself this week evoked the lasting anger and hurt felt by some in Britain as a result of Thatcher's policies -- recalled now ""her leadership of this nation, her courage, her steadfastness, and her resolve to accomplish what she believed to be right for the common good."" Giving thanks for the country's traditions of freedom, democracy and rule of law, he invited those gathered to pray. Only twice did a quiet murmur of laughter punctuate the solemn calm of the proceedings, when Chartres recounted anecdotes which gave a more personal sense of Thatcher's dealings with those she met. She may not be able to control how she is judged by future generations, but the late prime minister's hand was behind much of the service that marks the end of her physical presence on Earth. Opinion: Why Britain needs another Thatcher . As Chartres pointed out, at her request this was not a memorial service, filled with eulogies, but a simple funeral that reflected her disciplined Methodist upbringing as a grocer's daughter in Grantham. He acknowledged the contentious nature of her legacy, saying, ""the storm of conflicting opinions centers on the Mrs. Thatcher who became a symbolic figure -- even an 'ism,' "" but said that lying there, she was ""one of us,"" subject to human destiny. ""There is an important place for debating policies and legacy; for assessing the everyday lives of individuals and communities ... but here and today is neither the time nor the place,"" he said. ""This is a place for ordinary human compassion of the kind that is reconciling. It is also the place for simple truths which transcend political debate."" Thatcher's granddaughter, Amanda, gave the first reading, her voice clear and steady despite the gravity of the occasion. Its theme of righteous struggle, ""not against flesh and blood but against principalities, against powers, against the ruler of darkness of this world"" was perhaps meant to bring to mind Thatcher's own struggles, first to reach power as a woman in the 1970s and then to exercise it for the good of her country. As the Bishop of London said, ""In a setting like this ... it is easy to forget the immense hurdles she had to climb."" Cameron, who now leads the Conservative Party that Thatcher headed from 1975 to 1990, gave the second short reading from the King James Bible. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, rounded off the service with the final blessing. The hymns and predominantly English music, chosen by Thatcher and her family, reflected the tastes of a woman Cameron described last week as a ""patriot prime minister"" with a ""lion-hearted love"" of her country. And at the end of the funeral, as the other illustrious guests filed out -- including 11 serving prime ministers, 17 serving foreign ministers and senior clergy from around the world, as well as many British lawmakers -- the sense was reinforced that this was a farewell to a woman who, like her or loathe her, was truly out of the ordinary. Indeed, many observers noted that the pomp and ceremony of her funeral procession, with full military honors, was barely distinguishable from the state funeral accorded to a monarch. No UK prime minister has been given such a farewell since Winston Churchill died nearly half a century ago. Former Prime Ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major, former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper were just a few of the familiar faces among the departing guests. Some 50 of the guests had links to the Falkland Islands, the disputed territory over which Thatcher led Britain to war against Argentina in 1982. After receptions where relatives, dignitaries and former colleagues gathered to discuss their own memories of the politician once known as the ""Iron Lady,"" Thatcher's family accompanied her coffin to a west London crematorium for a final farewell. As Chartres said, those close to her must sometimes struggle to recognize the woman they know in the ""mythological figure"" created over decades of life in the public eye. But as her daughter, Carol, said last week, the tributes paid by foreign and British leaders on her death prove that, whatever one's views on her politics, Thatcher's ""place in history is assured."" Cameron's verdict, given via Twitter, was that the funeral was ""a fitting tribute to a great prime minister, respected around the world.""","More than 2,300 mourners fill St. Paul's Cathedral for Margaret Thatcher's funeral .

fefd872ed4fa655424c5d4750ee8d22033b90913,"President Barack Obama slammed the NFL as an 'old boys network' that has so far failed to send a clear message condemning domestic violence in an interview on Friday. He said the league needs a 'wake up call' as it was 'behind the curve' reacting to the footage of Ray Rice punching his then-fiancee, now wife, unconscious. And if there is going to be a change in attitude, he said, it needs to start in college football where 'blind spots are rooted' and 'certain behaviors have been tolerated'. Scroll down for video . 'Old boys network': President Obama said the NFL needs to send a clear message about domestic violence . 'You don’t want to be winging it when something like this happens,' Obama told ESPN's Colin Cowherd. 'You want to have clear policies in place. 'There has been a little bit of an old boys network in terms of how it operates. 'There have been some blind spots that are rooted not just in pro football but dating back to college football and certain behaviors have been tolerated historically that really should not have been tolerated. 'Hopefully this is a wake-up call.' Obama's comments came in an interview about politics in sport with ESPN, during which he plugged his health care law. 'Behind the curve': The president said NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has been slow to react to the cases . 'Wake up call': He addressed the case of Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice who punched unconscious his then-fiancee, now wife, Janay Palmer (both picture). Obama said it should act as a 'wake up call' for the NFL . Asked whether NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell had 'too many men' around him, the president said all leaders have a duty to promote women and ethnic minorities to senior levels. But he voiced his support for the policies that are now being tabled to address athletes' off-the-field behavior. Earlier this week NFL owners unanimously voted for a new personal conduct policy to be put in place. Among the changes, unveiled in Irving, Texas, on Wednesday, are a 'more extensive' list of prohibited conduct and NFL-funded counseling and services for victims, families, and violators. An exterior body will invigilate, the statement said. Obama also addressed sports players who have used their position to make political statements about the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. Another case: The league's reputation was also hampered by the case of Minnesota Vikings' Adrian Peterson who has admitted to hitting his son with a switch . LeBron James, for example, warmed up for last week's Cavaliers v Nets game in a t-shirt that read 'I Can't Breathe' - the last words of father-of-six Eric Garner who was killed in a police chokehold, and whose killer has avoided indictment. It comes after six St Louis Rams players walked on to the pitch with their hands in the air - a reference to 18-year-old Michael Brown who was claimed to have raised his hands before officer Darren Wilson shot him dead. Obama noted that athletes are citizens as well as entertainers and have a right to make their feelings known. 'Some of our greatest sports heroes – Muhammad Ali, Bill Russell, Arthur Ashe – they spoke out on issues that mattered at pretty critical times,' he added.","President Obama said the NFL was 'behind the curve' on Ray Rice .

Police say a Nebraska mom who disappeared last month with her son strangled the 10-year-old boy before strangling herself in the woods of an Iowa state park. Council Bluffs police said Monday that Charlotte Schilling, 41, of Plattsmouth  and her son, Owen, both died after being strangled with plastic cords in a murder-suicide. The Schillings were missing from May 10 until their bodies were found May 20 in Lake Manawa State Park, south of Council Bluffs in western Iowa, about 20 miles north of Plattsmouth. Gone: Charlotte Schilling, 41, checked her son Owen, 10, out of his elementary school on May 10 to go camping and had not been heard from since . Council Bluffs police say Charlotte Schilling tried to commit suicide with a plastic cord in November, but a family member intervened then. Police believe she strangled her son first and then herself with the cord. Council Bluffs Police Sargeant Chad Meyers said Schilling actually lost consciousness during her previous suicide attempt, and a family member heard her fall. Unusual: The night before she disappeared Charlotte told a neighbor she didn't feel well and had fallen and bumped her head. But her husband said nothing was out of the ordinary . That time, however, someone was able to cut the cord off Schilling's neck quickly enough for her to recover. Investigators said friends described behavior in the days before Schilling disappeared with her son as consistent with someone contemplating suicide. For instance, Mr Meyers said Schilling gave away some of her personal belongings. 'Individually, each one of these people probably wouldn't have known anything was different,' he said. 'When you put it all together and look at it, it paints a pretty clear picture of someone who is contemplating suicide.' The night before the woman and boy . went missing, another neighbor, Athena Meneses, said she spoke to . Schilling at a local Cub Scout meeting, where Meneses had taken her own . son and Owen. Owen had wanted to join the group, Meneses said. 'I . didn't really know her very well, but she seemed upset. She had a bump . on her head,"" Meneses said of Schilling. ""She didn't seem like she was . really happy that night. She said she wasn't feeling well and that she'd . like to go home. She told me that she had fallen down earlier that . day.' Relatives have said it wasn't unusual for Schilling to surprise her children with short road trips to parks, zoos and other nearby attractions. But the woman always called home and past excursions never lasted long. Her family grew worried when neither she nor Owen returned home, and Schilling's cellphone went unanswered. Happy: Carl schilling, left, with his wife Charlotte Schilling, centre, and their son Owen, right, in a family photo posted on Facebook in 2010 . Charlotte's daughter, Lindsay . Schilling, 20, said that is when she became concerned. 'I called until . her phone died - every minute,' she told KETV.com. 'The fact that she didn't pick up mine - that's when it hit me: there's something wrong right now.' Investigators believe the bodies of Charlotte and Owen Schilling had likely been lying in the woods near Lake Manawa since May 10 when Schilling checked Owen out of Wade Robin Elementary School in Bellevue, Neb. But police cannot determine the exact date of their death. Police found Schilling's vehicle at the park where the mother and son's bodies were later found. Schilling's cellphone and wallet were in her car, about a half-mile from where the bodies were found. Authorities had to rely on autopsy results to confirm the identities because of decomposition. Mystery: Police have not ruled out the possibility of a murder-suicide in the deaths of Charlotte Schilling, left, and her son Owen, right . Sunday night a passerby saw two decomposed bodies found at Lake Manawa State Park . After an autopsy officials confirmed on Tuesday that they were the mother and son .

'Nothing seemed out of the ordinary. They were just like any other mom and son. There was nothing that showed . me anything bad was going to happen.'

A 22-year-old man threatened to tell a married woman's husband about their one-night stand and put naked pictures of her on the internet unless she gave him more than £1,000. Nathan Walsh blackmailed his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, by text message for more than year, saying he would expose their affair unless she handed over the cash. The traumatised woman made more than a dozen payments before she eventually went to the police. Walsh, who fainted in the dock as he was sentenced, was jailed for three years. Walsh had sex with the woman after going for a drink with her in 2012 and kept explicit photographs of her, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. He started sending her text messages a few days later, telling the woman he would put the images on the internet and tell her husband if she didn't give him money. Prosecutor Timothy Harrington said the woman withdrew cash from her bank account amounting to about £1,100 and made a series of payments over 12 months before finally calling the police. He said: 'That was money she could ill afford. The payments in total appear to be about a dozen. 'She found it difficult to deal with this, as has her husband. She feels they have lost trust between each other.' Satvir Aujla, defending, said Walsh, who has no previous convictions, had been stupid, 'young and naive'. She said: 'He was too wrapped up with his own debt and the loss of his grandmother at that time.' The traumatised woman made more than a dozen payments before she eventually went to the police, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard . Walsh, from New Invention in the West Midlands, initially denied blackmail between July 2012 and September 2013 but pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial. He fainted in the dock as he was sentenced to three years in jail. Judge Martin Walsh said: 'This was a vicious and ugly offence and no doubt traumatised the complainant.

feff65566c05d9b5fdde90ec9b4e525156dbfce0,"(CNN) -- Goran Hadzic, the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect still at large, was captured in Serbia Wednesday, a war crimes tribunal announced. An ex-Croatian Serb rebel leader who has been a fugitive for seven years, Hadzic was wanted for crimes against humanity and war crimes in connection with the wars that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. The former president of a self-proclaimed Serbian republic in Croatia, Hadzic is accused of trying to remove Croats and other non-Serbs from the territory and the ""extermination or murder of hundreds of Croat or other non-Serb civilians,"" among many other crimes, according to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. He was the last fugitive of the 161 people indicted by the tribunal. The announcement, also made by Serbian President Boris Tadic, comes less than two months after the capture of the highest-profile war crimes suspect still at large, former Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic. Plans were being made for Hadzic's transfer into the Tribunal's custody after the completion of legal proceedings in Serbia.  Authorities hope he'll soon be in custody at The Hague in the Netherlands, where the court is based. ""I welcome the arrest today of Goran Hadzic, the war-time Croatian Serb political leader of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina,"" Tribunal Prosecutor Serge Brammertz said. ""Hadzic's transfer into the Tribunal's custody is a long awaited development for the victims of the crimes charged against him. It is also an important milestone in the Tribunal's history. Eighteen years after the Tribunal's creation, we can now say that no indicted person has successfully evaded the Tribunal's judicial process. This is a precedent of enduring significance, not only for this Tribunal, but also for international criminal justice more generally."" The European Union and NATO welcomed the capture of Hadzic, with the EU saying it would help clear the way to Serbian membership in the club of nations. ""This arrest sends a positive signal to the European Union and to Serbia's neighbors, but most of all on the rule of law in Serbia itself,"" EU leaders said in a joint statement, saying Serbia was ""confronting the past and turning the page to a better European future."" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Twitter that the arrest was ""an historic moment for international justice & the victims of war crimes during the Balkan wars of the 1990s."" Ratko Mladic was seized May 26 after more than 15 years in hiding and extradited to the Netherlands to face trial at the criminal tribunal five days later. He has proved an obstructive defendant, arguing with judges about who should represent him, and in a recent appearance, a judge ordered him removed from the chamber. His superiors during the wars that saw thousands massacred were Radovan Karadzic, who was captured earlier and is now on trial, and Slobodan Milosevic, who died in jail while on trial at The Hague. Brammertz said the apprehension of both Hadzic and Mladic ""mark a long-awaited step forward in Serbia's cooperation with the Tribunal.  Serbia has now produced visible evidence that cooperation with the Tribunal is not an empty promise but a genuine commitment and we look forward to Serbia's assistance with our ongoing work."" The prosecutor touched on the ""prosecution of war crimes"" in Balkan nations, saying they pose ""a critical challenge for the region and its people."" ""The Office of the Prosecutor will continue to use its best efforts to assist the fight against impunity in the former Yugoslavia, by providing national prosecutors with information, evidence and expertise. The international community also has a key role to play in ensuring that national prosecutions can successfully take over the Tribunal's work in establishing accountability for the atrocities committed."" Hadzic is the former president of the self-proclaimed Republic of Serbian Krajina and was indicted in 2004 for crimes against humanity and war crimes allegedly committed in the eastern Slavonia region of Croatia in the early 1990s. The indictment against Hadzic said he was ""a co-perpetrator in a joint criminal enterprise"" -- the permanent and forcible removal of a ""majority of the Croat and other non-Serb population from approximately one-third of the territory of the Republic of Croatia""  to make the land part of a ""new Serb-dominated state."" Under the indictment, Hadzic is charged on the basis of individual criminal responsibility for having participated in the following actions: . ""Exterminating or murdering hundreds of Croat and other non-Serb civilians, including women and elderly persons, in Dalj, Dalj Planina, Erdut, Erdut Planina, Klisa, Lovas, Grabovac and Vukovar. ""Imprisoning and confining hundreds of Croat and other non-Serb civilians in detention facilities within and outside of Croatia, and establishing and perpetuating inhumane living conditions, including repeatedly torturing, beating and killing detainees in these detention facilities. ""Forcing Croat and other non-Serb civilians to perform labour when detained or under house arrest in Vukovar, Dalj, Lovas, Erdut and Tovarnik."" He is also accused of other crimes against the Croat and other non-Serb civilian population. They are ""imposing restrictive and discriminatory measures,"" beatings, robberies and arbitrary arrests, deportations and forcible transfer of thousands, and the deliberate destruction of ""homes, other public and private property, cultural institutions, historic monuments and sacred sites.

feffc073e43c4affe577f247994a7ce2fc3ad6b7,"(CNN) -- Forget the new black. This is the real black. A British nanotech company has created what it says is the world's darkest material. It is so dark the human eye can't discern its shape and form, creating what has been called a black hole. Vantablack, made out of carbon nanotubes, is designed by Surrey NanoSystems and absorbs 99.96% of all light that hits it. Conventional black, such as black paint or fabric, absorbs between 95% and 98% of light. The company says Vantablack was the darkest material ever tested by the National Physical Laboratory in the UK, as well as the Institute of Standards and Technology in the U.S. The material is made up of millions of carbon nanotubes, each measuring two or three nanometers -- or roughly one millionth of a millimeter. It is grown on aluminium foil. Creases and bumps on the foil are easily picked up by the human eye. But once covered with Vantablack, all wrinkles and roughness seem to disappear. ""Some people describe it as a hole, because there is literally not enough light coming from the surface to allow the eye to discern the contours that are in that foil,"" Surrey NanoSystem's Steve Northam told CNN. Sound like the ultimate slimming little black dress? Actually, no. A Vantablack dress would render the curves and contours of the human body invisible and cause ""the wearer to look like a two-dimensional cardboard cut out,"" Northam said. Instead, the material is designed to help air-borne cameras, telescopes and infrared scanning systems work more efficiently by reducing stray light. Military clients are lining up to buy it, as is the space industry. The benefits, Northam said, are that ""your systems can see fainter objects further away, you improve the sensitivity and you improve the signal to noise ratio in these systems."" The material, whose development was backed by the UK's Technology Strategy Board, was launched at this year's Farnborough Airshow in southern England. According to Ben Jensen, chief technology officer of Surrey NanoSystems, it was a ""major breakthrough by UK industry in the application of nanotechnology to optical instrumentation."" So far, Surrey NanoSystems has only grown Vantablack on foil. It plans to grow it different materials and on three dimensional shapes. Read more: Britain's spaceport ambitions revealed .

ff0006370c899956af8226f665dd36c12ba93af4,"(CNN)  -- Martin Kaymer's victory in last year's U.S. PGA Championship has given him the ""belief and motivation"" to add to his major tally at this week's British Open at Royal St George's this week. The 26-year-old German burst to prominence with his victory at Whistling Straits and had a brief spell as the world's top-ranked golfer earlier this year. Kaymer told CNN that his triumph had impacted on him in a ""very positive"" way as he approached each major. ""It gave me a lot of belief and motivation I could do well, especially coming to big events like the British Open,"" he said. Kaymer believes that putting could well prove the key to victory come Sunday on the links course in south-east England. ""You will miss the greens and you will have some long putts with a lot of slopes between you and the hole,"" he told the official tournament website. ""It's very tough to hit them to a foot or two, so that's why I think there will be plenty of tricky putts that you have to save for par,"" he added. Kaymer is a big supporter of the only major outside of the United States, saying it was his ""favorite"" tournament of the year. ""It's a fantastic major and is so different than all the other tournaments and that makes it very special and new. ""You have to be creative and you have to think a lot and mentally it's very tiring. That's what I like about it. It's not normal. You have to play different golf."" Looking at the other contenders for the title, Kaymer made a point of singling out U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy and admitted he watched on in admiration as the Northern Irishman dominated the field at Congressional. ""The way he played made me feel like I need to practice more. I need to hit more balls, need to become a better player because he played that golf course almost in a perfect way."" he said. Kaymer is paired with defending champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa and American star Phil Mickelson for the first two rounds.","Martin Kaymer chasing second major title at this week's British Open .

ff01478e07465f6a83a3c0da0b15c62c519c1f5e,"These pictures show more than 1,000 cyclists laying across a central London road in protest at dangerous traffic conditions. Dubbed a 'die-in', protesters blocked roads outside the Transport for London headquarters in Southwark as part of a vigil for six cyclists killed in the capital this month. The demonstration saw riders spread across Blackfriars Road with their bikes strewn around them, while others held candles in tribute to the latest spate of casualties. Scroll down for video . Protest: Cyclists lay across a central London road as part of a mass 'die-in' outside Transport for London . 'Die-in': Thousands attended the Stop Killing Cyclists protest - held as part of a vigil for six riders who have died in the city this month . Donnachadh McCarthy, 54, one of the organisers of the Stop Killing Cyclists protest, said the plan was inspired by riders in Holland, who used similar tactics to push for investment in safe transport infrastructure. Beginning the 15-minute die-in, he said: 'We Londoners are going to join the Dutch, and follow them until we get our roads safe. 'So I respectfully ask you now, London cyclists and pedestrians and drivers who have come to join us today, to lie on the pavement with your bicycles, turn on your lights and let them flash in the memories of people killed and injured in the last eight years. He added: 'We are here because Londoners are fed up of being killed. We need to have modern, European, safe cycling network. We believe it’s a human right for children and pensioners to cycle around our city safely, and at the moment they can’t. Action: The protestors, inspired by riders in Holland who used similar tactics to call for investment in transport, were calling for better safety measures on the roads . Calls: Participants were calling for £600million to be spent on safer cycling in London following scores of deaths on the roads . 'We have brought the battle to TfL’s headquarters because these are the people making the decisions. We want representations and we want real funding. We want £600 million a year spent on safer cycling in London. 'We believe that we need a separate, segregated modern cycle network that is at least two metres wide. We can do that in London, there is plenty of space to do it.' Six cyclists have been killed on the capital's roads in the past month. Brian Holt, 62; Francis Golding, 69, Roger William De Klerk, 43, Venera Minakhmetova, 24, a 21-year-old man from St John’s Wood and a man believed to be in his 60s all died between November 5 and 18. Dramatic: One protestor covers herself in fake blood for the protest, while others lay on the road . Scale: Protestors laid in the road with their cycles for around 15 minutes for the 'die-in' The number of cyclists killed in London so far this year, 14, now stands equal to those who died in 2012. Scene: A cyclist his 30s died in Gateshead . A cyclist died after colliding with a double-decker bus. The incident happened in Shipcote Lane, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear at 4.08am this morning. The cyclist, a man in his 30's, was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle where he was later pronounced dead. Police and paramedics attended the scene and the A167 Durham Road is closed between Shipcote Lane and the Five Bridges roundabout while enquiries are carried out. Leon Daniels, managing director of TfL Surface Transport, said one of the protesters’ key demands - segregated cycle routes - were to be introduced in the next 10 years. He said: 'We are all shaken by the recent spate of deaths on the roads, and our sympathies are with all the friends and families of those affected. The protesters are rightly demanding safety should be at the top of our priorities. It is. 'That’s why we are investing nearly £1 billion in upgrading the existing superhighways with greater segregation, introducing major new segregated routes and backstreet quiet routes, and overhauling dozens of junctions to give more protection to cyclists. He added: 'Delivering such major improvements will take time, but we are working flat-out to do so. We and the mayor have set out our plans and the first major improvements, such as the segregated extension of the Superhighway to Stratford, are now being seen. 'Over the forthcoming weeks and months Londoners will see many more improvements as the investment we are making bears fruit.' The protest, organised in part by cycle activist group Critical Mass, follows a police operation that stationed hundreds of officers at busy junctions around central London. Vigil: 14 cyclists have been killed on the London roads this year - equaling the number who died in 2012 . Investment: TfL have said they are working flat-out to make improvements . Operation Safeway deployed 650 officers to 60 junctions during evening and morning rush hours on Monday, primarily targeting cyclists who breach the highway code. London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'This targeted operation has been hugely effective at raising awareness of road safety among motorists and cyclists. 'This is a balanced operation reminding everyone of their duty to take care of each other while out on the roads, and I hope the figures put to rest concerns by some groups that they are being singled out.' On November 5, hospital porter Brian Holt, 62, died on Mile End Road in east London as he cycled along Cycle Superhighway 2. He was crushed by a tipper lorry as it moved off from stationary during the evening rush hour. Architect Francis Golding, 69, crashed with a coach in Holborn, central London also on November 5. He died on November 8. The following Tuesday, November 12, Roger de Klerk, 43, died after he was crushed by a single-decker bus outside East Croydon station in south London. Cyclist: Venera Minakhmetova with her bicycle. She died on Wednesday November 13 . Latest victim: Richard Muzira who died after being knocked from his bicycle by a lorry in Camberwell . The next day Venera Minakhmetova, a Russian entrepreneur died after being hit by a lorry at the notorious Bow roundabout on the Cycle Superhighway at rush hour. That evening a 21-year-old man from St John's Wood was hit by a bus at 11.30pm in Aldgate, near the Cycle Superhighway 2. He died the following morning. A cyclist in his early 60s died on November 18 after a collision with a lorry on Camberwell Road in South London. He was named the next day as Richard Muzira.","Thousands took part in the 15-minute 'die-in' in Southwark, central London .

ff0151d496189c50f4ad4ffa13c2c89fc3af9bad,"Brendan Rodgers hailed Liverpool’s fighting qualities after they overcame a huge fright to make a winning Champions League return. Steven Gerrard held his nerve to fire in a last-gasp penalty, which secured a 2-1 win against FC Ludogrets, but that was only after Liverpool had conceded a 90th minute equaliser to substitute Dani Abalo following another defensive mix-up. Mario Balotelli had earlier opened the scoring but while he was delighted to get Group B off to a winning start, Rodgers admitted there was significant room for improvement in the quality of Liverpool’s performance. Brendan Rodgers praised Liverpool's fighting spirit after they beat Ludogorets 2-1 at Anfield . But the Liverpool manager did say his side would have to improve tactically in the Champions League . ‘If you can win your home games and pick up points away from home, it gives you a chance,’ said Rodgers. ‘We are not at the standard we were last season. We have a lot of players who have come in and are still adapting. We are a work in progress. ‘I thought we showed great determination. At times we had quality and then in the final third we couldn’t make that final pass. Tonight was about perseverance, an attribute you need to have. We kept going. It is a competition that is about winning and winning games. Sometimes you will play well and not get a result. ‘It was very important to be back in the competition. It was always going to be a tricky tie. Technically they were very good. We had to show patience, change the shape from 4-3-3 to a diamond. Mario gets a great goal. I am disappointed with the equaliser we conceded . Mario balotelli scored his first goal for the club after signing from AC Milan this summer . It was Liverpool's first Champions League match since they lost to Fiorentina at Anfield in 2009 . ‘But maybe in the first six months we would have drawn but we showed the experience and character in the group, the young kid (Javier Manquillo) in the box pushing hard to get something and he gets his reward in the penalty that Stevie scores.’ Balotelli came to life after he scored his goal, almost grabbing another with a thumping drive, and Rodgers believes the goal will do wonders for his confidence following his high profile switch from AC Milan. ‘Mario is used to scoring,’ said Rodgers. ‘He had two games when he hadn’t scored. I just feel with him, he needs to be in the box more. I said to him at half-time “make sure when the ball is in wide areas, make sure you are penalty spot and in” ‘He is 6ft 3ins and great in the air. He shows great touch and the finish was a wonderful touch. On top of that I thought he worked very hard. He is still trying to get fit but he showed us his quality.’ Ludogorets thought they had secured an unlikley point after Dani Abalo scored a late equaliser . After conceding an equalise in the 90th minute, Steven Gerrard than converted a penalty to win it . Rodgers, whose side now travel to FC Basel – thumped 5-1 by reigning champions Real Madrid – on matchday two, admitted that Liverpool have to learn to concentrate until the very end if they are to achieve his target of progressing to the knockout stages. ‘No question,’ he said. ‘I think certainly tactically there are questions asked. This is a tournament where mistakes get punished. We made one. The home games are very important for us. Away from home you have got to be compact and impose your style on the game. That is very important. ‘Anfield cranks itself up in terms of the noise level on nights like this. I am happy for the supporters; they are back in the competition they are synonymous with. It was a wonderful occasion and great to have that feeling of being back in the competition.’ VIDEO We showed great resilience - Rodgers .","Liverpool played first Champions League match since 2009 .

ff017687864d4bdfcf18548beb52995e3a91134b,"If you're planning to enjoy this spring or summer at a national park, you'd better leave your drone at home. On Friday, Yosemite National Park in California turned heads when it announced that drones, the unmanned aircraft increasingly making their way into private hands, aren't welcome in the park, famous for its picturesque valley of towering granite cliffs, waterfalls and Giant Sequoia groves. Apparently using drones to capture experiences at the park, on the western edge of the Sierra Nevada mountains, is becoming a trend. ""The park has experienced an increase in visitors using drones within park boundaries over the last few years,"" park  management said in a news release. ""Drones have been witnessed filming climbers ascending climbing routes, filming views above tree-tops, and filming aerial footage of the park."" And it's not just Yosemite. The buzzing aerial machines, which have become handy for everything from scaring off unwanted birds to delivering medicine and pizzas, aren't welcome at any of the 58 national parks. 15 ways drones will change your life . ""The ... regulations cited at Yosemite apply at all units of the National Park System,"" spokesman John Quincy said in an e-mail to CNN. The Code of Federal Regulations states that ""delivering or retrieving a person or object by parachute, helicopter, or other airborne means, except in emergencies involving public safety or serious property loss, or pursuant to the terms and conditions of a permit"" is illegal. The parks system says that applies to drones, though privately owned, unmanned aircraft probably weren't on anyone's mind when it was written. Yosemite's news release cited a list of ways the aircraft can be harmful. Among them: Ruining the experience for visitors with their noise, interfering with rescue operations and endangering wildlife in the area -- particularly the peregrine falcons that nest in the park's cliff walls. A quick search on YouTube finds a host of of videos shot using drones at Yosemite and other national parks. Some merely show shaky video from beginners sending their craft into the sky for the first time, while others are more professional productions that provide breathtaking views of the park's mountains, trees and cyclists and hikers. In a bit of irony, firefighters used a drone to battle the Yosemite Rim blaze that raged in and around the park last August.","The U.S. National Park Service says drones are not welcome .

Officer Vicki Thomas arrived on the scene last month, and when Jessica Robles admitted the food was for her starving family, Thomas sent her home with a misdemeanor citation and $100 worth of groceries. Since news of Thomas's act of kindness has spread, good will offers of money, food, and even a job have poured into the Robles household. Kindness of strangers: Miami-Dade police officer Vicki Thomas chose to buy a penniless mom some of the groceries she was caught trying to steal instead of arresting her . So grateful: Jessica Robles made the desperate decision to steal food for her hungry family. But getting caught has helped her turn over a new leaf . 'I made the decision to buy her some groceries because arresting her wasn't going to solve the problem with her children being hungry,' Thomas, a 23-year veteran on the force, told WSVN. Robles' 12-year-old daughter Anais shared the family's dire situation with the Miami FOX affiliate. '[It's] not fun,' she said tearfully, 'to see my brother in the dirt hungry, asking for food, and we have to tell him, ""There is nothing here.""'

If Paul Lambert is to quell the growing discontent among Aston Villa supporters, then he'll need Christian Benteke by his side. The Belgium international was on hand to ease the pressure on his manager on Tuesday night, scoring the winner, his first goal since March, against Crystal Palace. Benteke, making his return from a three-match suspension, is fully fit again after an achilles injury caused him to miss the back end of last season, the World Cup and the start of the current campaign. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail Big Match Stats: Crystal Palace 0-1 Aston Villa . Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke wheels away in celebration after scoring against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park . Benteke scored his first goal since March against Neil Warnock's side during the first half of the Premier League clash . Eagles goalkeeper Julian Speroni dives to his left but is unable to stop Benteke's strike from going into his net .

Referee: Michael Oliver 6.5. Attendance: 23,935. 'I've been lucky enough to play with some of the best players in the world, and if he keeps progressing (Benteke can get there),' said Lambert. 'He offers you that potency in attack. He had that really bad injury, and his suspension never helped our case, but he's been excellent since he's been back.' Lambert will be hoping his talismanic striker can now stay injury - and suspension - free as he looks to keep the wolves from his door. Villa supporters have been asking real questions of Lambert; the swell of opinion for the Scot to leave is growing. And pressure from the terraces looked to be transmitting onto the field as Villa started nervously. Brad Guzan was saved by Ciaran Clark's goalline clearance after his fumble from Yannick Bolasie's shot was stabbed goalwards by Dwight Gayle. The visitor's then faced strong appeals from Palace for a penalty after Tom Cleverley tangled with Wilfried Zaha, before Gayle missed his kick after Joel Ward's inviting cross. Villa's uncomfortable start continued as Joe Cole, fresh from his first Villa goal against Burnley on Saturday, limped off in the ninth minute with a hamstring problem as the Midlanders provided nothing in the way of attacking intent inside the opening 15 minutes. However, in the 28th minute Villa provided a spark - invariably it came from Benteke, who turned Scott Dann beautifully on the edge of the area before unleashing a right foot drive that Julian Speroni tipped over the bar. There was no goal, but at least it was something; a semblance of fight from Villa. And it proved the catalyst Villa's winner four minutes later in a moment Palace defender Scott Dann will want to erase from memory. The centre half, located on the right-hand touchline, only needed to clear Martin Kelly's pass to avert any danger - instead he dallied and was robbed by Benteke, who took full advantage by striding forward before slotting past Speroni. Benteke took advantage of an error by Scott Dann to score the only goal of the match - click HERE to see more of our brilliant Match Zone . Palace midfielder James McArthur was unable to close down Benteke in time to stop the Belgium international from scoring . Guzan ensured Villa stayed in front before the break, saving from Zaha and Bolasie as Palace pressed for an equaliser before Maroaune Chamakh sent a diving header wide in the 50th minute. Had Benteke got a touch on Ashley Westwood's dangerous inswinging free-kick or Andreas Weimann finished with just Speroni to beat then the second half would have been far more comfortable for Lambert. But it was from pleasant for the Scot as Fraizer Campbell, on for Gayle at half-time, was denied a penalty after Clark looked to have pulled the striker down - much to Warnock's dismay. The Palace boss was even more bewildered when Campbell, Bolasie and Dann all failed to get a toe on Zaha's low ball across the face of goal in the final minute. 'We are looking for a player like Benteke in January, I think held Villa together tonight,' admitted Warnock. 'We should have had a penalty, though, the referee's in a bad position and didn't see Campbell was pulled back.'

He even charged an entry fee – $5 entry before 8pm, $10 anytime after this, plus ones $10. When 30 police officers moved in to shut the party down they were bottled by revellers.

'We're actually sitting at the Midland Police Station this morning collating the cost of that operation because it's likely his mum will have to pay for it,' said Commissioner O'Callaghan. Mr Fulton's mother Michelle said that the party had nothing to do with her, and that she hadn't organised the party. The teenager has said that he intends to pay for the fine, should it come to his mother, though he insists he did nothing wrong and said that he registered the party online, told neigbours and hired bouncers.

Mark and Mitchell Davies were also at the The Royal Archer pub in Kingswood, Bristol, when trouble flared. Dove became involved in a row with members of the Davies family when Joanne Davies, Mark's sister, told her 'you should be in prison', it was said. A row kicked off and Mark, 39, scuffled with Dove's brother Simon, before Mitchell, 20, intervened to help his dad. Dove waded in to help her brother but was punched in the face, fell to the ground and kicked in the face by both the Davies men, the court was told.

ff02950921f83509dc33ee2b2d881601e1dd7e2b,"Former U.S. Marine Amir Hekmati has been convicted in Iran by a secret court of ""practical collaboration with the U.S. government"" and sentenced to 10 years in prison, his sister told CNN on Friday. The news follows a public campaign by Hekmati's family to win his release from Iran, where he has been held for nearly three years under Iran's claim that he was an American spy. Hekmati's attorney, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, told The New York Times on Friday that client had never been informed about the retrial, conviction or sentence. Tabatabaei told the newspaper he learned of the conviction during recent discussions with judiciary officials. He then telephoned to inform Hekmati, who has been held in Tehran's Evin prison, and with family members on the United States. Hekmati, 30, has long maintained his innocence, saying he had gone to Iran to visit his grandmother when he was arrested in August 2011, and accused by Iran's Intelligence Ministry of working as a CIA agent. Days before his arrest, Hekmati called his mother from Iran to say he would be coming home soon. He told them he would leave two days after a final farewell party his Iranian relatives were having on August 29. Hekmati never showed up at the party. Televised confession . For three months, no one in his family knew anything his whereabouts. Then one day in December 2011, Iranian state television aired Hekmati's purported confession that he was a CIA spy, and announced that he was imprisoned. Hekmati wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry saying a confession he made to the spying charges leveled by Iran were ""false"" and ""based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement."" The initial charge and detention has stretched to a two-year ordeal. Weeks after his on-air confession broadcast on Iranian television, Hekmati was tried in an Iranian court and sentenced to death. Months later, Iran's Supreme Court overturned his death sentence and ordered a retrial. During his imprisonment, Hekmati spent 16 months in solitary confinement and went on a month-long hunger strike. Enlisted in the Marines . Hekmati was born in Arizona and raised in Flint, Michigan, after his parents emigrated from Iran. His parents came to the United States in 1979 as the Islamic revolution spread across Iran. Hekmati joined the Marines after high school, and served four years, becoming a rifleman and also serving in Iraq. Two years ago Hekmati surprised his parents by telling them he wanted to visit Iran for the first time, to meet relatives he had never seen -- including his ailing grandmother -- and find his roots. The Hekmati family has tried to bring public attention to Amir Hekmati's plight, hoping to secure his release. Other Americans detained . Hekmati is the latest American in recent years to face arrest and prosecution in Iran: . • In 2007, Iran arrested several Iranian-Americans -- including Kian Tajbakhsh, Ali Shakeri and Haleh Esfandiari, who were all later released. (That same year retired FBI agent Robert Levinson went missing after last being seen on Iran's Kish Island. Despite photos from his captors, his whereabouts are still unknown.) • In May 2008, retired Iranian-American businessman Reza Taghavi was arrested on suspicion of supporting an anti-regime group. He was released more than two years later. • In 2009, three U.S. hikers, also accused of spying, were arrested but ultimately released. • Tajbakhsh was re-arrested in July 2009 amid post-election protests and a massive government crackdown. In March 2010, he was allowed a temporary release that was later extended, according to the website freekian09.org. The Iranian-American scholar is not allowed to leave the country, the website says. • Journalist Roxana Saberi was arrested in January 2009 and convicted of espionage in a one-day trial that was closed to the public. She was freed in May that year. • Literary translator Mohammad Soleimani Nia was detained in January 2012. • Christian pastor Saeed Abedini was reportedly detained in September 2012.","Amir Hekmati's attorney says his client was never told about the trial .

ff029ff18d2980e63ffd38a11bf3d888747ec3ff,"Clearwater, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida judge dismissed a batch of potential jurors in the Casey Anthony murder trial Tuesday because several members had discussed the case in the jury room. The ruling from Orange County Superior Court Chief Judge Belvin Perry Jr. came in the second day of jury selection in the trial of Anthony, 25, who is charged with capital murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. Perry asked the individuals whether another potential juror talked or asked about the case, and whether it went beyond just a reference to the case. At least a dozen raised their hand when asked if someone had spoken to them about Casey Anthony. ""Through no fault of your own I think it's best I let you go and return back to the central jury room,"" said Perry, who asked for more jury candidates Wednesday. The judge and lawyers are questioning potential jurors in groups of 50. They need 12 jurors and eight alternates. Perry tied the jury panel problem to a person, listed as a witness in the case, who had also been summoned for jury duty. That individual spoke with others in the jury room, the judge said. Concerns over Anthony receiving a fair trial led to the jury selection proceedings being moved to the Clearwater, Florida, courthouse, about 100 miles southwest of Orlando. Caylee's grandmother first reported her missing in Orlando in 2008, weeks after the girl was last seen, and five months before her body was found. Authorities moved the proceedings to Clearwater hoping to draw from a jury pool that was less likely to have seen and been influenced by the intense media coverage surrounding the case. Once jury selection is complete, the jurors will be transported to Orlando's Orange County for the trial, which is now scheduled to start May 17. Perry and lawyers have been asking jurors about possible hardships in hearing the capital case. ""Our system of justice depends on people like you willing to serve,"" the judge said Monday. ""You are being asked to perform one of the highest duties of citizenship."" Many excused jurors cited financial hardship -- saying they or their family would suffer if they couldn't work for two months. Others said they had to take care of loved ones. On a lighter note, a woman claimed hardship Tuesday due to her concern about a teen son who lives at home and worries about another son, 29, possibly throwing parties while she is on duty. Jurors also will be asked, one by one, for their take on the death penalty, which Casey Anthony would be eligible for if convicted on the murder charge. Lastly, the jurors will be quizzed on their knowledge of the case and other positions -- including if they have an opinion, prior to the trial, on Anthony's guilt or innocence. Throughout the selection process, Perry can weigh arguments from members of Anthony's legal team and state prosecutors and decide to exclude certain men and women from the jury pool. Casey Anthony also faces six other charges, including aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter of a child and misleading law enforcement. In Session's Jean Casarez and Michael Christian contributed to this report.","NEW: The judge says a witness in the case also was summoned for jury duty .

Dhaka, the capital, was largely peaceful except for small clashes. An uneasy calm prevailed there, with little traffic on the usually bustling city roads. ""We see a long tailback (traffic backup) here in Dhaka almost everyday, but a wave of fear forced people to stay back home at the weekend,"" said businessman Ariful Islam in the Dhanmondi residential area. A huge contingent of police and paramilitary troopers was deployed to ward off further violence. Anti-riot police guarded major mosques in Muslim majority Bangladesh on Friday, the weekly holiday. ""The situation is very much under control,"" the inspector general of Bangladesh police, Hassan Mahmood Khandker, told CNN. Besides the police, the Rapid Action Battalion and paramilitary troopers from Border Guards of Bangladesh patrolled. Road and rail communications were seriously disrupted as the protesters blocked highways and rail tracks in many places. Local police said at least three people were killed in Friday's violence outside Dhaka and five others injured on Thursday succumbed to their injuries. The 45 dead included five on-duty policemen, according to authorities. Police feared that the trouble might escalate next week because the Jamaat-e-Islami party announced a 48-hour general strike to begin Sunday. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party called a countrywide general strike on Wednesday in protest of what it said were ""the killings by police firing"" in the recent wave of unrest. Thirty-seven of the 45 dead were killed Thursday as Jamaat-e-Islami movement supporters clashed with police after the court sentenced Delwar Hossain Sayedee, one of the party's top leaders, to death. Sayedee, 73, was found guilty of eight counts out of 20 charges involving killings and rapes during the country's war of independence more than four decades ago and was sentenced to hang. Two International Crimes Tribunals set up by Bangladesh in 2010 were dealing with cases against 13 people. Separated with the help of India, Bangladesh had been the eastern part of Pakistan until it gained independence in 1971 in a war that claimed between 1 million and 3 million lives. Jamaat-e-Islami opposed East Pakistan's struggle for independence and has decried what it calls a smear campaign against it. The movement called the trial against Sayedee politically motivated.","Clashes continue in country .

Scene of the crime: It all happened at the Brandywine Valley YMCA in Pennsylvania (above) where Miller worked as a fitness instructor . Miller and Cassel were rushed to Brandywine Hospital where they were both pronounced dead. Officials told Daily Local News that it was clear that Cassel's plan was premeditated. This all happened just days after Miller wrote on her Facebook page on October 28, 'New beginnings!!! Getting excited.' On October 21 however, Miler did not seem as happy, telling her followers she was 'pissed off.' She elaborated on that in her comments section, telling one of her friends, she would 'always have an emptiness.' Miller, 41, had two sons and was described by all who knew her as one of the nicest and kindest people they had ever met. 'She was always laughing and just happy. Playing air guitar and head banging along with the music while teaching combat. Her biggest joy was her two boys though. She was Miss Football Mom!' said Sara Davidge, one of Miller's coworkers.

Jim Schnaitman, Miller's neighbor of four years, said, 'She's a great person, she's got two great kids, and I couldn't believe anybody would do something like that to her. He also told ABC 6 that Cassel seemed like a completely normal guy, saying he had recently been having beers and enjoying a bonfire with the 42-year-old. Cassel did not have a criminal record, and there are no recorded incidents of domestic violence between the couple. Chester County District Attorney Hogan stated, 'This crime is another tragedy of domestic violence. Two children have been left without a mother. There is no excuse and no good explanation for this sort of violence.'

ff04a921e5aa8d6150c2c71adf0e33d3f47cf7e5,"By . Suzannah Hills . The first ever gold coin to be struck in the U.S. more than 225 years ago is expected to fetch at least $5 million at auction. The gold doubloon was struck in 1787 and was the fledgling country's first ever coin intended for circulation in America's emerging colonies. Prior to its launch, settlers used foreign copper and silver coins they had brought with them or coins they had forged themselves. But only a handful of the gold doubloons were ever made and just seven exist worldwide today.The coin is estimated to sell for at least $5million when it goes under the hammer. Going under the hammer: This gold doubloon struck in 1787 is expected to sell for five million at auction . But experts believe it could fetch far more, beating the $7.6 million dollars paid for a $20 coin from 1933 called a Double Eagle, making it the second most expensive coin in the world. It could potentially even rival the $10 million world record set in January 2013 by the sale of a 1794 one dollar coin. The gold doubloon contains 26.66 grams of gold - slightly less than an ounce - and was worth $16 at the time, around $400 today. It was struck by New York goldsmith Ephraim Brasher, a neighbour to George Washington, and is being auctioned on behalf of coin expert Walter Perschke who bought it in 1979 for $430,000. On one side it features the Great Seal of the United States - an eagle holding an olive branch in its talons - and the motto 'e pluribus unum' meaning 'out of many, one'. On the reverse is a sunrise over a mountain with the words 'Nova Eboraca Columbia excelsior'. Columbia was an early name for the United Sates, Nova Eboraca is Latin for New York and excelsior - 'even higher' - was its motto. Worth more than its weight in gold: The coin contains 26.66 grams of gold which was worth $16 when it was made but is now worth $400 . Mark Borckardt, an expert in currency from Heritage Auctions, said: 'The Brasher Doubloon is a wonderful piece with an incredible history. 'It is one of the most famous coins in existence and among the most valuable too. 'What makes it so special is that it was the first gold coin ever to be struck in the USA. 'At the time the coins used by the fledgling colonies were either foreign ones they had brought with them or copper and silver coins they produced themselves. 'There were no gold coins and that was something Congress wanted to rectify. Top dollar: A Flowing Hair Silver Dollar, believed to have been the first silver dollar struck by the United States Mint, sold for slightly more than $10 million at a New York auction last January . 'Ephraim Brasher, a goldsmith in New York City and a neighbour of George Washington, produced a small number of gold coins called doubloons worth 16 dollars face value. 'Only seven now survive, two of which are in museums, and of the remaining five this one is the finest example - it is like new. 'The seller is a prominent coin dealer who bought the doubloon the last time it came up for sale in 1979 and has treasured it ever since. 'It will be many years before a coin like this comes up for sale again and we expect the auction to be a momentous event.' The auction will take place in Orlando, Florida, tomorrow.","The coin was struck in 1787 by New York goldsmith Ephraim Brasher .

The nurses' commands and questions filled the recovery room at an Egyptian hospital. Adnan Saleh's ""after"" photo. The tot from Egypt received surgery from Operation Smile to fix a cleft lip. Seven-month-old Adnan Saleh had just come out of surgery to fix a cleft lip. But suddenly his newly repaired mouth was filling with blood. The post-op nurses rushed to make sure he didn't choke. ""Mother! We need a mama,"" one of the male nurses shouted in his South African accent, once Adnan was stabilized. ""Speak to him!"" Adnan's mother did what we've all seen our own mothers do: pretend that she wasn't crying. ""Habibi, habibi,"" Ghada Saleh tried to say in as singsong-y a voice as she could muster, so Adnan would recognize her. ""My love, my love,"" in Arabic. At the same time, she attempted to discern her only son behind the stitches on his nose and lip, and wires everywhere else. ""Adnan, Adnan! It's me, Mommy,"" she bravely and desperately called out in Arabic. Just a moment earlier, I had come out of the operating room, running with the doctors and anesthesiologist to the recovery room, to tell his worried parents that everything had gone well and Adnan looked great. But now, this complication. His father's usually jovial demeanor was stiff. Once the commotion started, he left the room. I couldn't help but tear up. I would be lying if I said I hadn't gotten attached to Adnan and his family. I had been following their entire journey of ""kissing his cleft lip goodbye"" with the Operation Smile volunteers at their mission site in Alexandria, Egypt. I tried imagining what Adnan would have looked like without the surgery. Even with the cleft lip, he was ""Gerber baby"" cute -- but what about when he grew up? In countries like Egypt, people with cleft lips and/or palates are looked upon as ""cursed"" and virtually shunned from society. ""I just want my son to have a chance,"" Adnan's father told me the first day we met. Mohammed Saleh and his pregnant wife waited for hours for their turn with the Operation Smile doctors. The global rate for cleft lip and/or palate is about 1 in 750 births. In the United States, we don't think about the condition much because the surgery to repair it is routinely performed soon after a baby is born. But in Third World countries, the corrective surgery is expensive and hard to come by -- especially for families like the Salehs.  Experience the sights and sounds of Adnan's journey » . ""Papa! We need the father,"" the nurse called out again, after Adnan had awakened. I pushed open stainless steel doors and motioned with my head. Saleh came back in, calmer and smelling of cigarettes. It was the ""after"" moment. Adnan's eyes were closed, his face was puffy from the medication, but his nose and mouth were aligned, like the real ""Gerber baby."" His parents quietly studied their son. After spending a week with this family, I thought I could read some of the wonder and fear in their eyes. Wonder at the possibility of what their son could now become, be it doctor, lawyer or policeman. Fear at the prospect of going through this journey again with the baby on the way. The doctors I spoke with don't know exactly what causes the deformity. They point to genetic, environmental and nutritional factors. For example, they say in Third World countries, the lack of folic acid and the practice of intermarriage increase the likelihood of cleft lip and/or palate. Operation Smile focuses on the areas with the greatest need, from Bolivia to Bangladesh. The organization received a burst of publicity during the last presidential race: Republican nominee John McCain's wife, Cindy, has volunteered at the organization since 2001 (the couple's youngest daughter, adopted from an orphanage in Dhaka, Bangladesh, was born with a cleft palate). The doctors and nurses who volunteer their time and skill come from all over the world, pay their own way, are housed in places like military barracks (as we were), and work long days through the screening, surgery and recovery process. Despite the long hours, hard work and rustic conditions, all the professionals I encountered woke up and went to bed with a smile, knowing they were giving these youngsters a chance to do the same. I left the hospital to go to the airport while the Salehs were still sleeping, together, on one hospital bed, in a room with five other families just like theirs. Since then, I've received e-mail updates from Mohammed Saleh. ""Now he has the chance to do anything he wants, anything that makes him happy. The father is happy when the son is happy,"" Saleh wrote, ending with a smiley-face emoticon.","Reporter volunteers for Operation Smile mission in Egypt; meets Saleh family .

""I imagine yes, if we think the charges are unwarranted, unjustified, then how would we say, 'But you can carry on,'"" Foreign Minister Salman Khurshid said. ""I mean charges have to be withdrawn."" Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general in New York, was arrested and stripped-searched last week on charges of visa fraud related to her treatment of a woman she brought from India to work as her housekeeper. She's accused of telling the U.S. government she would pay the woman, who has been publicly identified as Sangeeta Richard, $9.75 an hour. Authorities say in reality, the woman received only $3.31 an hour and was told to keep quiet about the arrangement. ""This type of fraud on the United States and exploitation of an individual will not be tolerated,"" the chief federal prosecutor in Manhattan, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, said Thursday. Khurshid, however, said the matter should have been handled by Indian courts. ""It's not a really good idea to have people put question marks on the Indian judicial system,"" he told CNN. ""We may take time to decide cases in this country, but we have one of the finest rule-of-law institutions. ""I mean if you have a problem, you have a problem about compliance with the labor law, just tell us,"" Khurshid said. ""I mean what would we do â€” either withdraw the person, the employee â€” or just negotiate a, negotiate some, some exceptions."" Indian diplomat: Does she have immunity? The incident has outraged Indian politicians, some of whom may be stirring up anti-U.S. sentiment ahead of presidential elections, prompting the removal of barricades from the road leading to the U.S. Embassy. A senior U.S. official expressed concern about removal of the barricades. But Khurshid told CNN's Mallika Kapur that traffic barricades, not security barricades, were removed. Indian politicians have called the diplomat's treatment ""barbaric"" and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called her treatment ""deplorable."" Bharara defended how Khobragade was treated, saying officials took pains to treat her better than many other suspects. ""Khobragade was accorded courtesies well beyond what other defendants, most of whom are American citizens, are accorded,"" he said Wednesday. ""She was not, as has been incorrectly reported, arrested in front of her children. The agents arrested her in the most discreet way possible, and unlike most defendants, she was not then handcuffed or restrained."" In addition, she was allowed to keep her phone and make calls to arrange personal matters, including child care, he said. Khobragade was strip-searched by a female officer, Bharara said, but noted that's standard practice for every suspect taken into custody of the U.S. Marshal's Service. Debate: Arrest, strip-search of Indian diplomat 'barbaric?' In a statement, Secretary of State John Kerry expressed ""regret"" over the situation, without saying the United States had done anything wrong. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said officials are trying to arrange a call between Kerry and Khurshid. She also said the department has not received a request to change the status of the Indian diplomat and that such a change would not wipe out any criminal charges filed before her immunity status changed. Khurshid said Friday he hoped the row would not pose long-term harm to U.S.-Indian relations. ""I think it's important that we, we understand this is a valuable relationship for both sides. There's a huge amount of investment both public and private into this relationship,"" he said, ""and I don't think the world wants a relationship like this to deteriorate at all."" Khobragade is charged with one count of visa fraud and one count of making false statements, which carry a combined maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. According to court documents and statements, prosecutors argue she lied in her visa application to bring the housekeeper to the United States, promising to pay her the minimum wage of $9.75. She was actually paid $3.31 an hour, prosecutors say. Khobragade allegedly instructed the housekeeper to say she would be paid the higher rate and not mention her actual pay. Khobragade allegedly also had the housekeeper sign another employment contract that ""deleted the required language protecting the victim from other forms of exploitation and abuse"" and also deleted language that said Khobragade agreed to abide by U.S. laws, Bharara said Wednesday. That document wasn't provided to U.S. authorities as part of the visa application process, authorities said. Her attorney, Dan Arshack, said Thursday that the allegations have ""nothing to do with what the actual facts are."" Richard requested the second contact, Arshack said. The document shows that a portion of Richard's earnings would be sent to her husband in New Delhi, he said. ""And that's what happened,"" Arshack said. ""And that's what the documents support."" But Dana Sussman, the housekeeper's attorney, said his client was only paid the smaller amount, which was deposited into an Indian bank account. Her client denies being given any money in the United States that could be considered a salary, she said. ""I don't know what he's talking about,"" Sussman said of Arshack's claims. ""This story seems to keep changing."" Opinion: What about the nanny?

ff0558feb36fe91b48d91bb9348fe9a2af4d118f,"(CNN) -- Samoa Air has taken the next lunge in the debate on air travel and overweight fliers with a new extra-large seat for extra-wide passengers. ""The new seat is like a two-person couch, created from two adjacent seats without an armrest,"" the airline's CEO Chris Langton told CNN. The new seat will also have 14 inches of extra legroom, created by the removal of the row in front. The initiative includes the adoption of a boarding ramp, as opposed to steps. ""Most people around 130 kilos (285 pounds) struggle to get up most steps, so we've redesigned ours into a ramp to help bigger passengers get to their seats,"" said Langton. The tiny airline -- its fleet consists of three planes, each with 10 seats or fewer -- already operates the airline industry's only pay-as-you-weigh pricing scheme, which charges passengers according to their combined body and luggage weight. It transports some of the world's biggest travelers. A 2007 Forbes report claimed 80% of Samoans are overweight, and it's unlikely things have improved since then. ""Some of our customers top out at 210 kilos (460 pounds),"" Langton said. ""Many come in around 160 kilos and around 40% in the 100-130 kilo range."" Pay more get more . Langton said the move -- which will become operational in one of the airline's planes on June 26 -- is meant to offset extra costs incurred under the controversial pay-as-you-weigh plan and acts as a trial for potential implementation in other aircraft. ""Because some bigger passengers will be paying more, we want them to be comfortable,"" said Langton. ""It's a precursor to what will happen to our 100-seater planes, which we'll start operating in three to six months."" Data on passenger weight collected by the airline since November show that for every 50 passengers they fly, three to four will weigh 160 kilos (352 pounds) or more. The pay-as-you-weigh scheme has been criticized for condoning unhealthy eating by travelers. Langton disagrees. ""Airplanes run on weight, whether that's healthy weight or unhealthy,"" he said. ""Our problem is putting that weight on seats and the fact that different people weigh different amounts. It's completely separate from the issue of health."" The airline recently set up a scheme with a local fitness center in which members who lose weight at the gym receive Samoa Air vouchers giving them three kilos for the price of one -- a 66% saving. Weigh in and pay up . The airline's fee structure allows travelers to enter their approximate weight and that of their luggage and prepay based on that ""guesstimate."" A Norwegian economist recently published a paper advocating the practice. Some travelers have criticized the weight-based fare concept as a ""fat tax."" Others believe it's fair. ""Yes, if I am getting less than 100% of the seat I paid for, the person taking my space should have to make up the difference,"" a CNN.com commenter wrote. For a tiny carrier like Samoa Air, the fare model seems reasonable, according to airline analyst Vaughn Cordle, a partner at Ionosphere Capital, a transportation investment research firm. ""For this small operation, specifically with the aircraft they fly, weight restrictions are the key practical problem they have to deal with on every flight. They have a solid business case to charge for weight,"" Cordle said. But travelers are unlikely to see anything like it on a large U.S. airline, he said. ""For U.S. airlines, I think this is an issue they will not touch with a 10-foot pole because of the negative publicity and the practical purposes of weighing people at the gate.""

ff05c68f2874e6a4f7e8bc8ec53714257fa6aaf2,"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Friday that he regrets the deaths of 35 civilians in a military airstrike in a Kurdish area on the border with Iraq. Speaking to reporters in Istanbul, he said, ""It is an unfortunate outcome. It is a sad outcome."" Pledging a full investigation, he said those killed late Wednesday were smuggling cigarettes and fuel, with almost half of them below the age of 20. Erdogan said Turkey's military had been monitoring the area because it was in constant use by terrorist groups and that security forces had become suspicious because of the size of the group and number of donkeys used. The funerals of the victims, who all came from three villages in the Uludere area of Sirnak province, should now have been conducted, he said. His words came a day after a senior member of a Kurdish separatist group urged Kurds to rise up against Turkish authorities over what he called a massacre. Bahoz Erdal, a member of the command council of the armed wing of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, issued the call for action on the group's official website. ""We urge all the people of Kurdistan, especially the people of Hakkari (province) and Sirnak, to react to this massacre and seek a settling of accounts through uprisings from the perpetrators of this massacre,"" Erdal said in a statement. Some observers have sounded the alarm in recent months about escalating tension between Turkey and its Kurdish minority, warning it may reignite a conflict that has simmered since 1984 and claimed more than 30,000 lives. Turkey has been going on the offensive against Kurdish separatists based across its border in northern Iraq with bombings and incursions. Erdal dismissed comments made by the Turkish military general staff Thursday, however, as having ""nothing to do with reality,"" saying the attack occurred inside Turkey, not in northern Iraq as the general staff said. The general staff statement said the airstrike late Wednesday was in the Sinat-Haftanin area of northern Iraq, where many militant training camps are situated and there are no civilian settlements. Surveillance by unmanned aerial vehicles showed a group moving from Iraq toward the border with Turkey in an area ""mostly used by terrorists,"" it said. Erdal disputed that claim, saying the strike by Turkish air force jets was 30 kilometers (19 miles) away from Sinat-Haftanin in Uludere, in a Kurdish-populated area of Turkey. ""We do not have any camps, bases, activity or movement in the area as claimed. This massacre is an attack against our patriotic people of Botan,"" he said, using the Kurdish term for the Sirnak area. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said Friday that Turkey did not discriminate between its citizens, only between civilians and terrorists. ""Every citizen is so valuable for us,"" he said, quoted by the semi-official Anadolu news agency. He described Wednesday's airstrike as an ""exceptional incident"" that should be investigated according to the law. Turkey's President Abdullah Gul also said the incident was unfortunate, Anadolu reports. A senior member of Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) also said Thursday that indications were that those killed were civilians smuggling cigarettes. ""These people were thought to be terrorists; however, the first initial investigative information we have from the local authorities, especially from Sirnak Governor's office, indicate that these people are involved in cigarette smuggling,"" said the AKP's deputy chairman and spokesman Huseyin Celik. He said the strike had killed many members of the same family. ""Even if there was a situation 100% that these people were smugglers, these people should not have been subjected to this, they should not have been bombed. It is out of question,"" he said. Celik promised a full investigation into the incident. The general staff statement released Thursday said the military had received intelligence that militants were planning to attack border outposts following recent action against Kurdish separatists. In October, an attack killed 24 Turkish soldiers in the southeastern section of the country, where Turkey borders Iraq. The Turkish government blamed terrorists for that attack, and the United States pinned responsibility for the attack on militants from the PKK. Earlier this month, Turkish police detained dozens of people in a wave of raids focused on pro-Kurdish media organizations. The Kurds represent the largest ethnic minority in Turkey. For decades, they were the target of repressive government policies, implemented by officials who sometimes referred to them as ""mountain Turks."" The PKK is designated as a terror organization by Turkey and the United States.

ff06019bf301a20a46b10fdb83d7f7d9cd6dab6b,"By . Alex Greig . A Kazakh woman left disfigured after undergoing radiation therapy for cancer in her jaw that she never had is undergoing reconstructive surgery at a Kentucky hospital Monday morning. Lessya Kotelevskaya, 30, is receiving the $1 million surgery for free after a doctor at the University of Louisville Hospital heard about her plight and offered to help. It is expected to take up to 24 hours to complete. Kotelevskaya was misdiagnosed with cancer in her jaw in 2001 and underwent intensive radiation therapy that left a gaping hole in her cheek and no jaw bone. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Undergoing surgery: Lessya Kotelevskaya received aggressive radiation therapy for a cancer she never had after being misdiagnosed by Kazakh doctors . She was wheeled into surgery around 7:30 this morning. Her surgeon, Dr Jarrod A. Little, is working for free and will spend the next 24 hours in surgery with Kotelevskaya. Her cousin Oleg Sennick, 43, who moved to the U.S. in 1996, discovered her struggling to survive in 2012 and brought her to the U.S. for treatment. It was while he was working as a hairdresser that Sennik mentioned his cousin's situation to a client, who happened to be married to a doctor from the University of Louisville Hospital. She mentioned the case to her husband, and he said his colleagues may be able to help. 'She has a terrible problem, I know how to fix it. The rest is immaterial,' Little told ABC. Little will remove the dead tissue from Kotelevskaya's jaw, then take a piece of her leg bone and attach it, with skin and blood vessels attached, to the remnants of her jawbone and secure it using screws and a titanium plate. Big day: Dr Little speaks with Lessya Kotelevskaya and her cousin Oleg Sennik before surgery this morning . Long-lost cousin: Oleg Sennik spent years searching for his cousin Lessya Kotelevskaya after moving to the U.S. in 1993 only to discover her destitute and sick . Little says helping people like Kotelevskaya is what made him want to become a doctor. 'Plastic . surgery is typically associated with cosmetic stuff, and this is the . other part of plastics that took 11 years of training after college,' he . told ABC. 'This makes it all worthwhile.' Kotelevskaya has been so excited about the surgery that she hasn't been able to sleep, Sennik said. 'I just want to become a normal person . so I don't have to concentrate on my face,' Kotelevskaya, who had been living at a car wash when she was rescued by her cousin, told the Sun Herald. 24-hour surgery: Dr Jarrod Little is performing the surgery, which is expected to take up to a day and costs $1 million . The mother of a . seven-year-old boy, Erik, was 19 when she was told she had terminal . cancer in her jaw. She had gone to her doctor after being elbowed in the . face during a basketball game. The aggressive radiation treatment . she was given disfigured her face and made it difficult for her to eat, . talk or live a normal life. Her cousin says she was also given an abortion without her knowledge or consent. The 30-year-old can barely open her mouth and for nearly ten years believed she had a terminal disease. 'She pulls food apart and jams it behind her teeth and it leaks out the other side,' Little told ABC. 'She has gotten really innovative dealing with it.' For more than 10 years Lessya Kotelevskaya hid from society after aggressive cancer treatment left a gaping hole in her cheek. Her . husband left her after she became pregnant with her son, Erik, and . she began living on the edge of society, sometimes without a roof over . her head and taking on menial night jobs so that no one could see her . face. As well as damaging . her face, the misdiagnosis ruined Ms Kotelevskaya's life. She was . married and helped run her own clothing store at the time but, when the . treatment left her unable to eat or speak properly her husband left in . 2007 and the store was forced to close. Life-changing: Lessya Kotelevskaya, pictured in 2013, is to be given reconstructive surgery to repair damage caused by radiation treatment . Reunited: With her cousin's help, Kotelevskaya has begin making a new life in the U.S., where her son is in the first grade . 'She couldn’t work, because everybody would look at her and say something’s wrong with her, and she’s going to die anyway,. She was totally rejected by society,' Oleg Sennik, her cousin, told the Courier-Journal. With no business or immediate family to rely on, Kotelevskaya began a life in the shadows of society. To avoid the unkind stares of strangers, the mother took night jobs such as cleaning gyms or carrying sand to . people's doorways in winter. At one point, she was so hard up that Kotelevskaya, who has to hold a towel to her face when she eats to prevent food dribbling out the hole in her cheek, had to live in the utility room of a car wash. When her cousin eventually traced her, she weighed just 79lb. Sennik took her for treatment in  Ukraine, where he had been raised, and it was there that she first realized her cancer diagnosis was wrong. The first 72 hours after the surgery will be critical, says Little, because of the risk of a blot clot, which would undo all the work. Kotelevskaya will need to spend the next three weeks after the surgery in hospital recovering. Adjusting: Kotelevskaya and her son Erik enjoy their first Christmas in the U.S. in 2013 . Little explained that it was possible for doctors to mistakenly identify benign tumors in the jawbone for cancer. 'If you're not accustomed to looking at them underneath the . microscope, or you don't have specialized pathologists like we do here, . they can be mistaken for malignant tumors,' he said. To repair the damage suffered by Kotelevskaya, she had initial surgery on November 14. Today's operation is the final piece of the puzzle. Little said the procedure was common practice for his medical team because Kentucky has some of the highest rates of head and neck cancer. 'She missed so many years of her life. She said that this is the first time she’s feeling like she doesn’t have to hide,' Sennik said.

ff06131fa458c668503b42a011361f5381c7b9a1,"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Furniture from the rented mansion where pop star Michael Jackson died was being auctioned off Saturday, and among the most expensive items sold were paintings that went for $46,875 and $35,200. Some of the furnishings were made infamous by crime scene photos shown in this year's trial of Michael Jackson's doctor, Conrad Murray, who was sentenced last month to four years in the Los Angeles County jail for involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death. Though the mansion is located in Los Angeles' Holmby Hills neighborhood, the auction was being held in Beverly Hills and was being carried live online. Auctioneers were selling 524 items. Jackson did not own the beds, chairs, clocks, paintings, dishes and other objects, but their value was expected to skyrocket because of the personal touch added by the pop icon and his children in the months before he died on June 25, 2009. Julien's Auctions has been careful not to call it a Michael Jackson auction out of legal and public relations concerns, instead marketing it by the mansion's now-famous address -- 100 North Carolwood Drive. As of early Saturday afternoon, among the most expensive items sold were a $35,200 watercolor painting of floral still life by Maurice Utrillo and a $46,875 oil painting of fishing village by Adelsteen Normann. The table where Jackson's sedatives sat and the rug on which paramedics tried to revive him are also among the items on the sale block. Without the connection to Jackson, the entire property might bring $400,000, Nolan said. But with the connection, ""the sky's the limit,"" Julien's Executive Director Martin Nolan said. A chalkboard left behind in Jackson's kitchen may have cost a few hundred dollars, but what his children wrote on it makes it a very valuable object, Nolan said. The note, handwritten on the black board attached to a 26-inch-tall ceramic rooster, reads ""love Daddy/ I (heart) Daddy/ Smile it's for free."" It sat in the kitchen where, according to testimony in the trial of Murray, Jackson would eat lunch each day with Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson. It was not known which child wrote the chalk note, but Nolan said his research suggested it was from Paris, who was 11 when her father died. Another striking piece is a Victorian-revival-style armoire from Jackson's master bedroom. On the mirror, presumably where Jackson looked each day as he dressed, is a handwritten message of inspiration: ""Train, perfection March April Full out May."" The wax-pencil note is significant, considering that Jackson was battling the calendar as he prepared for his ""This Is It"" concerts set to premiere in London in July 2009. Murray's defense lawyers argued during the trial that the intense pressure on Jackson to rehearse for the 50 shows put him in a desperate fight for sleep, which led to Murray administering the surgical anesthetic propofol nearly every night in the last two months of his life. Julien's Auctions backed away from selling the bed in which Jackson received the fatal dose of the propofol after a personal request from his mother, Katherine Jackson, Nolan said. The auction house's re-creation of the bedroom where Jackson died -- euphemistically called ""the medicine room"" by the company -- features a bed-sized memorial covered with love notes from Jackson fans instead of the death bed. The nightstand seen next to the death bed in coroner's photos, bearing numerous bottles of sedatives and other drugs, is for sale. The ""French occasional table"" is listed for between $300 and $500. The room-size Oriental rug that covered the floor where Jackson was placed when paramedics tried to revive him is listed in the auction catalog for between $400 and $600. The couch and chairs where Jackson likely sat with show producers worried about his health in the days before his death are for sale. One chair in Jackson's bedroom has a stain which Nolan suggested was makeup spilled by the star as he sat in front of a mirror. None of Jackson's relatives has expressed an interest in any of the items, Nolan said. He pointed out that they had a chance to take whatever they wanted from the house in the months after his death. The notes and posters brought to the auction house by Jackson fans and placed on the ""medicine room"" memorial will be sent to Jackson's mother and children, he said. Jackson's relationship with Julien's turned sour in the last months of his life when he filed a lawsuit to stop the sale of furnishings from his Neverland ranch. The singer sued the auction company, claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from Neverland after he sold the ranch. The suit was settled in April 2009 when Julien's canceled the auction and later returned the items to Jackson.","Two paintings sell for thousands of dollars .

ff06437727029069bd6d5c4d0eb91fe099bf0a39,"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- From bakery to barber shop, cafe to carpet store, Iranians stroll their capital with a renewed step, uplifted by how their newly elected president seeks something remarkable after decades of cold war-like relations between their country and the West. Iran wants to talk. With the United States. With Europe. With everyone who's been skeptical of the country. And Iran is willing to discuss its nuclear program, President Hassan Rouhani says. ""I just feel it. It's not like I've seen anything, but I feel it,"" said retiree Syed Ali Akbar. ""It's the best thing to do. We've been hurting ourselves for years."" International economic sanctions against Iran have strained day-to-day living in Iran, making essential goods such as medicine expensive and hard to come by. That punishment has taken a toll. ""The sanctions have hurt us. Prices have gone up. There are things you can't find,"" said Hossein Mohamadi at the Barbari Bread Shop. To many Iranians, Rouhani seems to be really advancing the ""hope and prudence"" slogan he used during his successful campaign to become president in June, posturing as a centrist and reformer against hardline conservatives that characterized previous president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Rouhani had been Iran's national security council chief and its lead nuclear negotiator. ""With Mr. Rouhani here, we've become more hopeful that things will improve,"" Mohamadi said. Ramin Atouri, 28, is a part of the young generation to whom Rouhani appealed in his stump speeches. Atouri dislikes political isolation and applauds diplomacy. ""Everything is solved through friendship. War and sanctions and conflict never solve anything,"" Atouri said. One day, U.S. and Iranian president might shake hands . A new sense of optimism . Without doubt, the long years of hostility between Iran and the United States leave many Iranians wary and distrustful of Western countries. Those feelings endure and were captured by an open microphone that CNN set up Wednesday on a busy street in Tajrish Square, inviting passers-by to send a personal sound bite around the world. ""I say hello to all America,"" said one woman named Zahra. ""Your behavior is not very good. Your politics is about war and it's terrifying.... Don't create so many restrictions for us. Don't impose on us so many sanctions. Let us make progress."" In general, however, there's a whiff of euphoria for the first time in many people's memory. That was also expressed at the open mike. ""America is a great county and we want to have good relations with America, and our government is working to make that happen,"" said Reza, who didn't give her last name. ""We hope American politicians understand the circumstances, and through positive talks we can thaw this relationship that has been frozen for 35 years, so we can live side by side as friends."" A Tehran-based author and political analyst also sensed change in the air. ""So far he has done more than we expected,"" Sadegh Zibakalam said about the new president. ""Ever since the elections, there is a mood of optimism. There is a mood of hope. Wherever you go in Iran, you can see people happier."" Zibakalam went so far as to say Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also has altered his rhetoric, joining the prevailing hopefulness. ""I cannot fail to detect some changes with regard to the attitude of the supreme leader ever since the elections,"" Zibakalam said. Wherever Iranians gathered and did business, they spoke to how new ground was being broken -- and whether they believed it was for real. At a carpet store, Sadegh Kiyaei, 50, believed a new day was dawning. ""He's the hope of the future of Iranians, especially the way he's talking to the world and especially to America,"" Kiyaei said of the new president. ""We believe the two nations -- Iran and America -- they believe they need each other and like each other. They feel it's the right time to get together and start talking at least."" One mother, however, didn't endorse that sentiment. She is going to press ahead with her efforts to leave Iran. If there's a better future for her and her son, it's outside Iran, she said. ""In my view, I don't think you can get anywhere here in Iran,"" said the mother, Khoshvakht, who declined to give her last name. ""I haven't lost hope. I just don't think anything has changed. I'm just not that optimistic."" Her son, Omid, didn't like her mother's plan to leave. ""I want to stay,"" he said. ""My friends are here."" Rouhani calls for 'constructive' dialogue, end to 'unhealthy' rivalries . Wishing for an easier life . At the open microphone, several speakers didn't need prompting to broach perhaps the biggest subject on the international community's mind -- whether Iran is building nuclear weapons. Iran says its controversial atomic program is for peaceful energy purposes. But several Western countries want Iran to fully comply with a United Nations agency's inspectors looking into whether the nuclear development is to build a bomb. ""Hi, America,"" said one man named Mohsen. ""As far as I'm concerned, I don't think they're making bombs."" Then, he added, ""With all the sanctions they put on us, it's like putting a gun on someone's head. ""You respect our civil rights and we'll respect yours. It's just humanity,"" he concluded. Hassan Ahmadi has been a barber for 30 years and has three kids. He wants affordable medicine for his family. ""There's been a lot of tough times and rising costs,"" Ahmadi said. ""One hundred percent, I want to see better relations, so we can live a little easier. ""I'm hopeful that change will happen so we can escape all the worry,"" he added. Those who held contrary opinions were equally effusive. ""I don't have hope because I don't think Rouhani is everything in Iran. He still has someone over the top of him,"" said Ali Ahadi at a newspaper stand. That superior is the ayatollah. A coffee shop owner agreed. ""The final decider is the supreme leader. Maybe if things change, then he'll change his mind. So in the end, I'm not optimistic,"" proprietor Amin, who declined to give his last name. ""We just want to live in peace. That's my only wish -- to live in peace."" Perhaps the most commonly shared view on Tehran streets was rejection of how Western leaders harshly characterize the country. ""I know they call us terrorists, but you show me which one of us is terrorists?"" Ahadi said at the newsstand. ""Iranians are (hospitable) and kind and honest."" Rouhani brings 'charm offensive' to U.N. CNN's Reza Sayah contributed to this report from Tehran. Michael Martinez wrote from Los Angeles.","Throughout the capital, Iranians sense a new future in the air .

The tragic loss of researchers who died should be used to push the life-saving agenda of the meeting, the UN AIDS chief  Mr Michel Sidibe urged as he spoke outside Melbourne Arts Centre Hamer Hall on Friday night. A special tribute to the former president of the International AIDS Society (IAS) and ‘giant’ of HIV research, Joep Lange, was also given by Mr Sidibe. A minutes silence was held in honour of the delegates travelling to an AIDS conference in Melbourne who were killed on flight MH17. Victorian Premier Denis Napthine, Proffesor Sharon Lewin, Robert Doyle, David Davis and Alischa Ross paid their respects . The UN AIDS chief shared an emotional hug with Proffessor Sharon Lewin after they both spoke of their talented friend, who was a father of four girls and a boy. The 20th International AIDS Conference was nearly cancelled after it emerged many of the 298 who died when Flight MH17 crashed in Ukraine were delegates with their family members. Organisers of AIDS2014 still don't know exactly how many of the 12,000 researchers coming to Melbourne for the five-day conference were on board MH17.

Professor Sharon Lewin (Co Chair Aids 2014) hugged UN AIDS Chief Mr Michel Sidibe after they both spoke of their friend Joep Lange who was killed on flight MH17 . Media reports put the number at 108, but a spokesman for the International Aids Society said there had been no confirmation of that figure. Mr Sidibe said the tragedy should be used to bring the dreams of the delegates into reality. 'We should use this day, which is a very difficult day for us, to transform it,' he said. 'We should use this moment of sadness as a moment for us to push our agenda; our agenda for saving lives of millions of people.' His sentiments were echoed by International AIDS Society president Francoise Barre-Sinoussi. Killed: Dr Joep Lange, a Dutch HIV researcher and former president of the International AIDS Society (left) and (right) Glenn Thomas, a British press officer for the World Health Organisation . It was tweeted that Pim de Kuijer (left) and Martine de Schutter (right) were on MH17, en route to AIDS2014 in Melbourne . 'The decision to go on, we were thinking about them because we know it's really what they would have liked us to do,' Prof Barre-Sinoussi said. She said the number of delegates on the flight remains unknown. 'We don't have the confirmation (of numbers),' she said. 'We don't know how many were on that flight.' US-based IAS president-elect Chris Beyrer told reporters in Melbourne it was not yet known how many ‘friends and colleagues’ had been lost, but the death of Prof Lange meant ‘the HIV/AIDS movement has truly lost a giant’. Professor Lange was one of 154 Dutch passengers on the jet apparently shot down over eastern Ukraine early on Friday while on its way to Kuala Lumpur, where he was scheduled to change planes. The Professor of Medicine at University of Amsterdam was travelling with his partner Jacqueline van Tongeren. He was due to speak on Sunday. Alischa Ross, the founder and CEO of YEAH (Youth Empowerment Against HIV/AIDs), gave a powerful speech . Candles were placed by a sign for flight MH17 on Princes Bridge . Flowers were placed alongside a message that read 'RIP, in memory of the many lives sadly lost on the way to beautiful Melbourne' Professor Lange’s colleagues said that he was one of those who had 'changed the course of humanity'. AIDS lobbyist Pim de Kuijer and other researchers Martine de Schutter and Lucie van Mens were on the flight, along with World Health Organisation media relations coordinator Glenn Thomas, who was British. 'It is with deep sadness that WHO lost one of our colleagues in the Malaysia crash,' Mr Hartl said of Mr Thomas. No other UN staff were on board the doomed flight, Mr Hartl said. US doctor Seema Yasmin described Professor Lange as a ‘kind man and a true humanitarian’. Taking to Twitter, Dr Yasmin said of her friend: ‘How do we measure how much a person has done for humanity? People like Joep change the course of humanity’. Nobel laureate Dr Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, co-discoverer of the AIDS virus and president of the International AIDS Society, said if confirmed, Prof Lange's death would be ‘a terrible loss for all of us’. He had dedicated his life to ‘the benefit of mankind’, he said. Victorian Premier Denis Napthine spoke outside Melbourne Arts Centre Hamer Hall, which will be lit up nightly from Friday July 18-21 with a series of unique digital art projections putting the spotlight on creating a HIV-free generation . UN AIDS Chief Michel Sidibe hugged Victorian Premier Denis Napthine after his emotional tribute to his friend . A crowd turned out to pay their respects to the delegates who lost their lives on flight MH17 . Close friend and Director of UNSW's Kirby Institute, Professor David Cooper said Prof Lange had been an integral part of the HIV response. ‘He was one of the first global advocates for treatment in low and middle income countries.’ Prof Cooper said his family had spent several holidays in Europe and Australia with Prof Lange, who had separated from his wife and found ‘true happiness with Jacqueline’. The AIDS conference must go ahead because that's what Prof Lange would have wanted, he said. ‘After this tragedy, it should be a wake up call for them (donors) to get back in there and increase their pledges, to finally end the tragedy of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.’ University of Melbourne's Professor Rob Moodie, a chair and speaker at the AIDS 2014 conference, said the loss of Prof Lange was a major blow to the HIV research community.

Delegates held a candle-lit vigil on Melbourne's Yarra Bridge on Friday evening. HIV worker Andrew Lesa, a delegate from New Zealand, said many of those who died were ‘giants in the industry’. ‘Their loss will be a big loss to the movement,’ Mr Lesa told AAP. He said continuing with the conference was the best way to honour those who died. ‘I don't think they would want it to be cancelled.’ The conference is the major scientific event for HIV, and speakers include former US president Bill Clinton and Sir Bob Geldof via video link, and UNAIDS executive director Michel Sidibe.

The candidates were sent a memo on October 8 outlining the format, rules and logistical information for the debate. Among those rules: No electronic devices. The memo stated: ""There will be no opening and closing statements, no notes, no props and no electronic devices will be allowed on stage. Candidates will be provided water, notepad and pen,"" a CNN spokesperson said Thursday. The CNN spokesperson said electronic devices range from a cell phone to a fan. Crist's decision to place a fan on stage during a separate debate Wednesday night triggered what the moderator described as ""the most unique beginning to any debate not only in Florida, but anywhere in the country."" Related: Fan delays Florida debate . Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, was seven minutes late walking onto the stage -- while moderators tried to explain during the live broadcast that he had decided not to participate because Crist had placed a small electronic fan under his own podium to keep cool. Almost immediately, ""#fangate"" was trending on Twitter. Crist, standing alone on stage, asked if the candidates were ""really going to debate about a fan."" Eventually, Scott walked onto the stage. His campaign said later that it was actually Crist who was in the midst of intense behind-the-scenes conversations with debate organizers over whether his fan would be allowed -- and that Scott was just waiting to see what happened. He hadn't realized that Crist had gone on stage. Scott said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" with Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had been waiting in a trailer for debate officials to tell him to head to the stage. ""They said he wasn't going to show up, that he was balking about his fan,"" Scott said, adding that he didn't care if Crist had a fan, a microwave or a humidifier. The organizers of the October 15 debate backed up Scott's version of events Thursday, saying Crist clearly broke the rules -- and ignored instructions given an hour before start time -- by having an aide place the fan on stage. Each campaign was sent a letter ahead of time explaining that ""candidates may not bring electronic devices (including fans), visual aids or notes to the debate,"" the two groups that hosted the debate Wednesday, Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association, said Thursday. Crist's campaign signed and returned that letter two days before the debate with a handwritten note appended saying the Democrat agreed to those rules, ""with understanding that the debate hosts will address any temperature issues with a fan if necessary."" Dean Ridings, the president of the Florida Press Association, got the note and told Crist's campaign that while organizers wanted all candidates to be comfortable, the auditorium at Broward College, where the debate was to be held, ""would be maintained at a comfortable temperature, and if there was a temperature problem, the partners would deal with it appropriately."" The stage was at 67 degrees at 6 p.m. Thursday, an hour before the debate. At 6:20 p.m., it was 66 degrees. But at some point in that 20-minute span, a Crist campaign aide placed the fan on stage -- ""and they were again told that no fans would be permitted,"" organizers said. ""In the minutes before airtime, the communication among the campaigns, the producing television station and the debate partners was chaotic and there undoubtedly was some confusion, but Gov. Scott never told Ridings or Wendy Walker, president, Leadership Florida, that he would not join the debate,"" the organizers said. ""Rather, the Scott campaign was waiting on resolution of the rules issue before Scott took the stage. The debate partners appreciate Gov. Scott's willingness to participate in the debate.""","Rules of an October 21 CNN / WJXT debate prohibit electronic devices, including fans.

ff07a814c4560aaaa1d28a25a2cbdf0aca7f09b3,"(CNN) -- Juventus cast aside the disappointment of crashing out in the Champions League group stage, thumping Sassuolo 4-0 in Serie A on Sunday. The three points were much welcomed by Juve, which exited Europe's top club competition in snowy Istanbul, and Carlos Tevez's hat-trick would have pleased the Argentine striker, too. Tevez also set up Federico Peluso's headed goal with a free kick. Tevez had only hit the back of the net once in his previous seven appearances. Even though Sassuolo hovered just above the relegation zone prior to kickoff, its play in the last month suggested Juventus might struggle. But Tevez's early goal -- in the 15th minute -- put the visitor under pressure at the Juventus Stadium in Turin. He added efforts in the 45th and 68th minutes. Sassuolo rarely troubled Juventus keeper Gianluigi Buffon without the services of leading scorer Domenico Berardi -- who is on loan from the Old Lady. Juventus, the reigning Italian champion, moved six points clear of Roma, which visits AC Milan in a high-profile encounter Monday. And in the league, Juventus has won eight in a row without conceding. ""It was a good way to make amends for Wednesday,"" Buffon told Sky Italia. ""The elimination hurt us, but now there's another trophy we now have to try and win."" Veteran German striker Miroslav Klose returned from injury and provided some relief for Lazio manager Vladimir Petkovic, scoring both goals in a 2-0 win over Livorno. Petkovic was under pressure following a spell of six league games without a victory. Giuseppe Rossi scored his league-leading 13th goal -- three better than Tevez -- in Fiorentina's 3-0 win over Bologna. In Sunday's late kickoff, Napoli doubled 10-man Inter 4-2 to close in on Roma. Atletico keeps pace with Barca . In Spain, Atletico Madrid rejoined Barcelona on points at the top of La Liga after a stunning second-half performance against Valencia. Diego Costa scored twice to tie Cristiano Ronaldo on 17 league goals and Madrid's less famous team blanked Valencia 3-0. Between his goals, Costa was denied from the spot by Diego Alves. Valencia -- in mid table -- matched Atletico in the first half but the home side upped the tempo in the second. Costa worked his way into the box in the 59th minute and Alves couldn't keep out his low shot. Alves, however, had little chance on Raul Garcia's rocket in the 63rd minute. Alves saved Costa's penalty in the 74th minute but Costa was fouled again in the box and this time converted in the 81st. Atletico and Barcelona each have 43 points and the same goal difference but Barca has scored one more goal. The sides meet in early January. A good day for Bayern . It was a good day for Bayern Munich -- and the Bavarians didn't even play. Bayern maintained its seven-point advantage atop the Bundesliga after second-place Bayer Leverkusen slumped to a 1-0 loss -- at home -- to struggler Eintracht Frankfurt. Frankfurt last tasted victory in the league in the middle of September. Marco Russ scored the game's only goal with a 61st-minute header and Frankfurt missed the chance for a second when a penalty was saved in injury time.","Juventus coasts past Sassuolo 4-0 to increase its lead in Italy's Serie A .

Mamadu Bama was the second-in-command, the military said in a statement. He was killed this month along with his father, who was the group's spiritual mentor, the military said. The militant group has not released any statement on the deaths. Boko Haram has attacked various targets in the nation since 2009, murdering and kidnapping Westerners, and bombing schools and churches. It is suspected to be behind a gruesome mosque killing this week. In that attack Sunday, militants brandishing automatic weapons killed 44 worshipers in the country's troubled Borno state. Around the time of the attack, the group released a video boasting that it was growing stronger. Boko Haram translates loosely to ""western education is forbidden/sinful."" It holds all government authority in contempt and wants to establish a state in northern Nigeria under Islamic law. Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of extrajudicial killings in its fight against the militant group. ""Soldiers have allegedly burned homes and executed Boko Haram suspects or residents with no apparent links to the group,"" Human Rights Watch said in a report this year.

ff07e464aee66872d8082a815d5d80c347cdb55f,"These are the three Christmas miracles - sent from heaven. Anna Mitchell tragically lost four babies and thought she would never be a mum. But when her own mother died, she left Anna some money in her will and she used it to pay for IVF treatment. Amazingly she found she was pregnant with not just one baby - but three. Anna Mitchell is celebrating her first Christmas as a mother of triplets after previously losing four babies . Anna and husband, Nick, conceived babies Summer (centre), Joseph (left) and Jacob via IVF using money left by her late mother, Nicola, after she died of cancer . She gave birth to her triplet gifts from heaven in July - and the family are set to have their first ever Christmas together. Anna, 30, from Mansfield, who lives with husband Nick, said: ‘We haven’t bothered decorating our house for years, as there was just the two of us and no children to fill it. 'But this Christmas we have three wonderful little reasons to decorate the house from top to toe with baubles, tinsel and lights. 'It’s the first Christmas we have with our three little miracles, Summer, Joseph and Jacob - and we mean to make the most of it. 'But there is one thing we won’t forget - and that's mum, who made it all possible.’ The couple had been trying for a baby when Anna’s mum, Nicola, discovered she had liver cancer. She lost her first baby through an ectopic pregnancy - where the baby develops in the fallopian tube instead of the womb - whilst her mum was in a hospice, before she died. Anna said her three babies were a gift sent from heaven from her mother Nicola who died from liver cancer . Anna said she and her new family are looking forward to 'the most amazing Christmas, with our three gifts from heaven' She lost her second baby, also through an ectopic pregnancy, in summer of 2010, and then lost her third baby in November 2010. She was rushed into the operating theatre after losing her second baby and doctors removed her fallopian tube. Anna said: ‘It was life-threatening to me to lose these babies as each time my fallopian tube could have burst. ‘Doctors removed one of my fallopian tubes. It was devastating, it was taking away some of the chance I would have to be a mum. ‘After losing my third baby I couldn’t believe it. I had already lost three babies. I was terrified I was never going to be a mum.’ The doctors broke the news to Anna that she would be unlikely ever to fall pregnant naturally. So the couple came to the decision to try IVF treatment, using the money that Anna had been left by her mother. Anna lost four babies - three after suffering ectopic pregnancies - before finally giving birth to her triplets . She said: ‘I was going to use it to . start having IVF treatment. If I couldn’t be a mum naturally, then I . needed help. And mum’s money was a perfect gift from her. She knew how . much I wanted to be a mum, and now she was giving me the chance. The couple had their first course of fertility treatment at CARE fertility in Nottingham, but it didn’t work. Anna said: ‘It was devastating, but I knew that we had to keep trying. It’s what mum would have wanted.’ So in April 2012, they tried again for the second time, but again Anna had an ectopic pregnancy - and lost her fourth baby. They decided to have one final go in December 2012, and she fell pregnant. Anna and Nick have decorated the house for the first time in years as they celebrate Christmas as a family . Anna, pictured on her wedding day, said she feared she would never become a mother . She said: ‘I lay on the scanning table . hardly daring to breathe. 'And there it was - a little heartbeat pumping . away. I cried with relief. I’d lost four babies, and now here it was, a . heartbeat in the right place at last. 'I felt as though mum was looking . down on me and helping me along.’ But at 13 weeks pregnant, the sonographer had amazing news for them - there wasn’t just one baby in there, but three. She said: ‘I nearly fell off the table with shock. Then I started crying all over again. I wasn’t just having one baby, I was having three. 'I’d waited all these years to have a baby, and now three were all coming at once. And it was all thanks to mum, it was her triple gift from heaven for me.’ The babies were born one after the other in July, by caesarian at the Kingsmill Hospital in Mansfield. Summer weighed 3Ib8 and the identical twins Joseph at 3Ib8, and Jacob at 4Ib5. Anna added: ‘It will be the most amazing Christmas ever this year, with our three gifts from heaven. 'I’ve decorated the house from top to toe, and I know that somewhere out there, mum is looking down on us. 'Having three babies has made up for all that heartbreak. 'And it’s all thanks to mum and her amazing gift that we are going to have the best Christmas ever.’","Anna Mitchell feared never becoming a mother after losing four babies .

ff082e2b1b7eb32c68e5111b1221b078680d2747,"'Myth': Many of the reported benefits of health supplements have no scientific evidence to support the claims . Millions of people who take dietary supplements to ward off cancer may be toying with a ‘two-edged sword’ that might do them harm, experts have warned. People were being misled by ‘messages from supplement manufactures’ stressing the health benefits of their products, including cancer prevention, according to a team of U.S. scientists. They said there was no good evidence that supplement pills and capsules reduced the risk of cancer in healthy individuals. They pointed out that antioxidants such as beta carotene, and vitamins C and E might even have biological effects that promote cancer. Antioxidants are believed to counter the destructive effects of rogue oxygen molecules called free radicals. Oxidative stress by free radicals, which attack cell membranes, proteins and DNA, has been linked to cancer and heart disease. But the U.S. authors, writing in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, argue that the supposed benefits of antioxidant supplements are largely a myth. The panel of five experts, led by Dr Maria Elena Martinez, from the University of California at San Diego, wrote: ‘Undoubtedly, use is driven by a common belief that supplements can improve health and protect against disease, and that at worst, they are harmless. ‘However, the assumption that any dietary supplement is safe under all circumstances and in all quantities is no longer empirically reasonable.’ Health supplements are booming in the U.S., with annual sales estimated at £18.6 billion, said the scientists, who assessed the evidence relating to several supplements including antioxidants, folic acid, vitamin D and calcium. A number of animal, laboratory and observational studies had appeared to show that dietary supplements could lower cancer risk, they said. However, these findings were not confirmed by the ‘gold-standard’ in evidence-based medicine, randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Alarm: Scientists said it is no longer true to assume, at worst, health supplements did no harm after finding some antioxidents can increase chances of cancer . Only a small number of RCTs had been carried out to test the effectiveness of dietary supplements, said the experts - and several of these had reported increased risks. ‘Supplementation by exogenous anti-oxidants may well be a two-edged sword,’ the scientists wrote. ‘These compounds could, in vivo (outside the laboratory), serve as pro-oxidants or interfere with any number of protective processes such as apoptosis induction.’ Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, causes malfunctioning cells effectively to ‘commit suicide’. Experimental studies had shown that different tissues with different cancer-triggering pathways may not respond the same way to a particular nutrient. ‘In fact, a nutrient may be associated with protection in one tissue and harm in another,’ said the experts. They added that supplement users were ‘sometimes quick to discredit caution’ and distrustful of mainstream science which they suspected of being corrupted by links to the drug industry. Users may also assume the supplements they bought to be as well regulated as over-the-counter medications. ‘These beliefs underscore the need for efforts by scientists and government officials to encourage the public to make prudent decisions based on sound evidence with respect to use of dietary supplements for cancer prevention,’ the scientists concluded. Graham Keen, Executive Director of the Health Food Manufacturers’ Association, which represents supplement manufacturers, said: 'The vitamin and mineral supplements industry has an exceptional record of both safety and efficacy, in the UK and worldwide.'","Scientists say claims of the benefits of antioxidents made are largely a 'myth'

ff0832b03417cabd94a7dea29c09e60035ea8836,"Orange, California (CNN) -- Ian Chung is nestled in darkness. Born just 24 weeks into gestation, he weighs scarcely more than a pound. He can hear the faint sounds of the outside world mingling with the soothing sound of his mother's voice. His spindly arms and legs shake as he lets out a warble. ""Oh, my love,"" coos his mother, Julie Chung, 31. ""You're going to be OK."" Julie's hands descend -- one landing lightly on Ian's chest while the other pushes against his jerking legs. She is using touch and light pressure to simulate, for her premature son, her own womb. A few moments later, Ian stops crying. ""When he was born he was so tiny,"" said Chung. ""It was like, 'Oh wow, can a baby even survive outside the womb this early?'"" Medical advances are improving outcomes for even the tiniest babies. Experts say fewer than 1% are born in the ""micro preemie"" category; at the hospital where Ian is being treated, Children's Hospital of Orange County in California, that means born before 28 weeks or born weighing less than 2.2 pounds. ""Survival rates (among micro preemies) have been improving,"" said Mindy Morris, a neonatal nurse practitioner at Children's Hospital. ""So they may survive to discharge. But then growing up as children they have a lot of complications."" Doctors and nurses at a specialized unit at Children's Hospital have implemented a system they say is dramatically reducing disability and infection rates among this rare preemie population. Aptly named the Small Baby Unit, the staff work under the cover of darkness and quiet in a separate wing of the hospital. Here, stimulation is kept to a minimum; speaking is only done in hushed voices. The overall effect is one of relative calm: an attempt to mimic what babies would experience if they were still safely tucked in utero. ""We try to keep it low sound, low lights, so that it is as close to the womb as we can get,"" said Morris, coordinator of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Children's Hospital. ""We try to minimize the intrusion to them."" In 2009, before the Small Baby Unit was up and running, 45% of babies were discharged with chronic lung disease. In 2012, after the unit had been operating for three years, the rate was down to 27%. Infection rates from 2009 to 2012 dipped from 41% to 15%, and feeding, weight and head circumference have also improved. Dr. Kristi Watterberg, chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on the fetus and newborn, said that developing processes to treat extremely low birthweight babies is -- broadly speaking -- a good thing. But since Children's Hospital's data are self-reflexive, she questions what exactly is contributing to the unit's success. ""When someone starts focusing on something, it tends to trend better,"" said Watterberg. ""What made it happen? We don't know."" Watterberg said that some elements of what is being done at Children's Hospital, including various forms of touch therapy, can be beneficial to premature infants. A large study published in 2004 found 21% to 48% greater weight gain among infants undergoing moderate massage therapy; they also were discharged sooner from the hospital. Other studies suggest that specific types of massage therapy stimulate production of growth hormones and promote bone development. At the Small Baby Unit, parents act as ""therapists"" and partners with the staff, so they are engaged fully with their child's progress. Studies show that mothers who massage their infants experience decreased depression and anxiety. 'It can hurt to be touched' Chung is learning about the thin line between stimulating and overstimulating her son. ""For preemies, it can hurt to be touched because their skin isn't ready for it,"" explained Karin Mitchell, a developmental therapist working with Chung. Mitchell grabs Chung's hand. ""Let me show you on your hand,"" she said, pressing on Chung's palm to show her how firmly to touch Ian. ""It's not heavy, but it's also not superlight."" ""Remember, when he was inside the womb there was amniotic fluid, and there was a feeling of that moving across every skin cell of his body,"" Mitchell said. ""That's what helps babies know, 'Where do I start and where do I stop?' ""When babies are born early like Ian, they don't have that option, so now they have to learn their body in the midst of air. It's a lot different."" Soon, Ian will lie -- tubes and all -- skin-to-skin on his mother's chest for an hour or more, something referred to as kangaroo care. Painful medical interventions like intubation, extubation and blood draws are performed while a baby is skin-to-skin with a parent whenever possible. In those situations, touch is thought to mitigate pain. ""Kangarooing,"" as mothers here refer to it, also helps with bonding and regulating things like respiration and sleep among babies. For mothers, it may stimulate breast milk production. ""It calms me when he's 'kangarooing' with me, and I notice he's more calm,"" said Chung. She pauses as tears roll down her face. ""It's nice to know that those things help him. You cling to those little things that can ease things for him."" Ian's care here is in stark contrast to what he got during his first few days of life, in a traditional NICU at another local hospital. There, according to his parents, the lights and noise were blaring. ""(This unit) is a laser focus on this very specific patient population. I think that is what makes this so unique,"" said Dr. Kushal Bhakta, medical director of the Extremely Low Birth Weight Program at Children's Hospital. ""Other places I've worked you will have a tiny premature baby next to an older child who has a heart condition, next to another child who may be crying,"" he continued. ""So there's ... a lot of other stimuli to this little tiny preemie and it's not done purposely. It's just the layout of whatever unit they're in."" Watterberg of the American Academy of Pediatrics said it is important to strike a balance, adding that theories and approaches regarding noise in the ICU are constantly evolving. ""We used to think it should be quiet, so when these babies came into the world too soon, we'd turn off the lights and make it quiet,"" said Watterberg, a professor of pediatrics and neonatology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. ""Turns out babies were hearing a fair amount of noise in utero, and that maybe if it's too quiet they are not hearing the kind of language they need."" She cites recent research that suggests too little sound could interfere with a baby's acquisition of speech and language, and that exposure to speech can enhance brain development in babies. Similarly, she said, too much darkness could be counterproductive to a baby's development, since in utero a baby would be exposed to a stream of information from its mother reflecting her own changing circadian rhythms. ""We know that what happens in the ICU affects babies long term,"" said Watterberg. ""So I'm pleased that this group is working on it, but the information we have is always in process."" Numbers . In the Small Baby Unit, numbers mean a lot. When Ian was born, they went something like this: 47% chance he'd survive, and if he did survive, only a 31% chance he would escape serious neurodevelopmental problems. Chung and her husband, Ryan Chung, temper the harsh reality of those statistics by focusing on other numbers â€” milestones Ian is reaching from day to day, week to week. Ian has already defied the steep odds that he would not survive: Today, he is 7 weeks old. ""We celebrated 10 grams last night,"" said Julie of Ian's weight gain since he was admitted to the Small Baby Unit. ""It's like '(He is) 2 pounds! Wow!' "" The Chungs believe that Ian's future prospects are improving because of his treatment -- in particular, the emphasis on touch -- in the Small Baby Unit. Three weeks and 10 ounces later, he is less reliant on supplemental oxygen and is less averse to touch. ""Julie, you want to massage him?"" asks Mitchell. ""Yes,"" says Chung, who glances up at the numbers changing favorably on a monitor above her. ""He likes it."" Weeks earlier, the monitor beeped incessantly. Today, Ian seems relatively calm -- more OK with his surroundings. Although some of the science behind what happens in the Small Baby Unit eludes her, Chung knows that one alternative -- little or no contact between her and Ian -- would leave her empty emotionally. She recalls an article she read recently describing how most NICUs operated years ago. ""Moms wouldn't touch their kids,"" said Chung. ""They would look at them through the glass wall. My heart broke for them. ""Not to be able to hold them or touch them or do any of that stuff?"" she added. ""All of that fulfills what I long for. It gives me something, even though it's little.""","Fewer than 1% of babies are ""micro preemies,"" a term that varies in definition by hospital .

ff0855ca0f158512548d79c75ccdfcdabbb2247e,"(CNN) -- Talk show queen Oprah Winfrey took her final bow in a taped episode that aired Wednesday, marking the end of her 25-year daytime talk show with a tearful goodbye. ""You all have been a safe harbor for me,"" Winfrey told her audience. ""My hope is that you will be that safe harbor for someone else."" The media mogul signed off by walking through her audience and offering an e-mail address -- oprah@oprah.com -- by which her many fans may contact her. ""I want you to know that what you have to say matters to me,"" she said, pledging to read as many e-mails as possible. Minute-by-minute blog of Wednesday's show . The final ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" audience included her boyfriend, Stedman Graham, filmmaker Tyler Perry and her fourth-grade teacher, a woman she called Mrs. Duncan. Winfrey said she has no regrets, though wished she could have done more to combat sexual predators of children. She then turned to Perry, who sat beside 200 other men in the audience who were once victims of sexual abuse as children. ""They are standing together to lift the veil of shame,"" she said. Each man carried a photo of himself as a child. Photos: Oprah through the years . In the end, Winfrey said her departure isn't bittersweet, but rather ""all sweet and no bitter."" ""Every single day I came down from my makeup room, I'd offer a prayer of gratitude for the opportunity to have done this work. To be embraced by all of you, it's one of the greatest honors a human being can have,"" she said. ""Many of us have been together for 25 years. ... So I thank you all for your support and trust in me. I thank you for tuning in every day. ... I won't say good-bye, I'll just say, until we meet again."" Beyond her studio audience, people like Funda Ray also reminisced about how Winfrey turned her daytime talk show into a televised forum for self-help. When Ray arrived on these shores two decades ago from her native Turkey, she hardly spoke English. But she learned, went to school and even college. Today, she works as a financial adviser's assistant. And she said it's all because of Oprah. ""She inspired me so much,"" said Ray, 44, of Hibbing, Minnesota. ""If it wasn't for her, I would have sat at home."" Gayle King: ""Oprah was so ready for this moment"" Ray was recording the last episode of Oprah Winfrey's show Wednesday -- she couldn't be home in time to watch. ""I'm going to miss her so much,"" she said. The talk show queen capped three days of farewell broadcasts that included appearances by Hollywood's top celebrities. Winfrey announced in 2009 that she was leaving the show that catapulted her into a household name and made her a part of American culture and a worldwide celebrity. Even Ray's mother, who arrived from Istanbul for a U.S. visit last week, got off the plane and asked her daughter: ""Do you know Oprah is retiring?"" Winfrey's popularity and credibility go hand in hand: If she gushed about a book, it became an instant best-seller. An appearance on her show was almost always followed by a rise in profile for the guest. Paula Pervall, 44, administrative assistant at the Elmhurst House of Friendship, an assisted living home in Wheeling, West Virginia, is among millions of Oprah fans. Oprah fans hold viewing parties . ""I think that it's sad that the up-and-coming generation is not going to be able to experience what she offered my generation -- the self-help, the inspiration to do better,"" Pervall said. ""She was very inspiring to people. She taught a lot of lessons."" The most important lesson? ""To be the best me that I can be,"" she said. Oprah has had many great people on the show, Pervall said. She remembers the woman who had the face transplant; she was from West Virginia -- ""that one jumps out at me."" Another show featured someone kicked out of a West Virginia town because of HIV. Winfrey taped the teary finale last week that included surprise tributes from superstars including Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Aretha Franklin, Michael Jordan, Will Smith and Madonna. The finale aired in three parts starting Monday and featured -- one by one -- dozens of Winfrey's famous friends taking to the stage to pay tribute to the talk show host at Chicago's United Center. Show producers kept her out of the loop about the guests. iReporters weigh in on Oprah's impact and legacy . Winfrey, who has in the past made it clear that she does not like surprises, gasped as her celebrity friends made appearances to thunderous applause, sometimes after a clue phrase. ""Pulling off this surprise has been mission impossible,"" Hanks said Monday, a nod to the famous movie starring Cruise, who walked on stage right after. Winfrey took in the scene in an arena filled with giant photographs of memorable show moments and thousands of adoring admirers. Winfrey had kept mum about plans for the final show, leaving her fans with one last surprise. Kathy Pittman, 55, of Columbus, Ohio, won't find out until Saturday. She'll be watching it with her daughter then, after the work week is over. For Pittman, who is African-American, Winfrey transcended racial barriers with her talk show. She first connected with Winfrey just months after the debut of ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" when the host visited Forsyth County, Georgia, a hotbed of racial tensions at the time. Pittman was intrigued by Winfrey's courage and her confidence to put herself in the middle of a volatile situation. Opinion: There will never be another Oprah . ""No one sees her as a black woman,"" Pittman said. ""She appeals to everyone. She showed us ... that you can do whatever you want to, that the sky's the limit."" It was refreshing to see an African-American woman rise to such enormous power and then use it to help heal the world, said Sondra Miller, 33, vice president of community engagement for Cleveland's rape crisis center. ""I think Oprah has built credibility over the years,"" said Miller, a subscriber to Winfrey's magazine and viewer of her show from childhood. ""She takes topics with an extreme amount of stigma, like sexual abuse, and makes people OK to talk about it."" Male survivors of sexual abuse was one such topic, Miller said. Winfrey interviewed actor, director and producer Tyler Perry about his own experience and had an audience filled with such survivors. Miller thought that was remarkable. ""I don't think we ever could have imagined that happening 10 years ago,"" she said. Miller was drawn to Winfrey's knack for approaching intimidating topics in a sensitive and empowering manner. For many of her fans, Winfrey's last show was history in the making. Her show will end, they said, but her legacy is lasting. Part of it will live on through runner Raymond Britt, 50, who first saw Winfrey at the Chicago Marathon in 1994. He had never run a race before, let alone a marathon. There was so much behind him but so far to go still -- five miles to the finish line. At mile 21, he caught a glimpse of Winfrey, who had just run the Marine Corps Marathon, cheering on the runners. She stood alone, without an entourage, simply encouraging everyone to keep going. ""If she could do it, then I could do it,"" thought Britt, of Winnetka, Illinois. He finished that day and went on to run 125 more races, including 85 marathons. ""It's possible I wouldn't have finished that first one without Oprah at the 21,"" he said. ""She inspires the human race."" And part of it will live on through Britney Deatherage, 26, of Lexington, Kentucky, who watched the shows with her mother and became a fan. The topics were more than current events, said Deatherage, a hairdresser. They focused on ""people's real lives and what they experienced."" ""She's just kind of like an idol to every woman,"" she said, illustrating that ""women can be what they want to be."" Winfrey is one of the most recognizable talk show hosts and has built a media empire, including launching her own cable television network, OWN. ""My vision for OWN is to create a network that inspires our viewers and makes them want to be who they are on their best day,"" Winfrey said. As Winfrey devotees mourn the end of her 25-year run, some speculate who -- if anyone -- can fill her void. Some already have a leg up on the competition. ""I've spent seven to eight years training at Oprah University,"" joked Mehmet ""Dr. Oz"" Oz, a Winfrey protege whose show will upgrade to 83 time slots and stations where ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" had aired. Oz added that he is grateful for the opportunity to take over the time slot, which is among the most sought-after in TV land. Winfrey's show made people like Dominique Taylor, 23, of Brooklyn reorient their lives. Taylor rescheduled her cheerleading practice, her voice lessons, everything around 4 p.m. so that she could be home in front of the television. Winfrey made the young woman laugh, made her cry. Today, Taylor sees herself as an embodiment of Winfrey's show, another part of her legacy. She's a young filmmaker who hopes to involve Winfrey's production company in her project. ""Her show was a platform for so many people to tell their story, for them to know they weren't alone,"" Taylor said. At 4 p.m. every day, Taylor, like millions of others, felt that she mattered.

Should Alan Pardew remain in charge of Newcastle? The seriousness of Alan Pardew’s headbutt was highlighted by the FA when they declared that the offence was a ‘non-standard’ case for their disciplinary department. Pardew has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to being charged for his astonishing attack on Hull City’s David Meyler. Then, a three-man commission will be chosen to decide on a punishment that could extend to a lengthy  stadium ban as well as a fine. Newcastle’s manager is not expected to appeal. He has already apologised and said he will accept whatever punishment he receives. VIDEO Scroll down to see Alan Pardew and Steve Bruce's comments after the headbutt . What was he thinking? Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew headbutts Hull City player David Meyler . Clashing point: David Meyler had to restrained by fellow player Hull City player Ahmed Elmohamady . Anger: Meyler was seen pushing Pardew as the pair clashed when a stray ball went out of play . Newcastle . United manager Alan Pardew has been charged in relation to an incident . in his side’s game against Hull City on 1 March 2014. It . is alleged that in the 72nd minute of the fixture, Pardew was involved . in an incident with a Hull City player that amounted to improper . conduct. Due to the serious violent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour this case has been designated as non-standard. Pardew has until 6pm on Thursday 6 March 2014 to respond to the charge. This means that the FA will not need to call on an experienced and expensive QC to chair the commission. An FA statement said: ‘Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew has been charged. It is alleged Pardew was involved in an incident with a Hull City player that amounted to improper conduct. ‘Due to the serious violent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour, this case has been designated as non-standard.’ Pardew has already been fined £100,000 and issued with a formal warning by Newcastle, but his position could be reviewed by club owner Mike Ashley if the manager is hit with a stadium ban. Pardew did at least discover that he had escaped criminal charges on Monday. A Humberside police chief said Pardew’s conduct could have been deemed ‘offensive’, but added that no-one had requested that the matter be taken further. Chief inspector Richard Kirven said: ‘Having reviewed the circumstances of the incident, it has been agreed that the matter will be dealt with by the FA, rather than considering criminal proceedings. ‘There has been no complaint received from either the player involved or Hull City. Humberside Police will not be taking any further action.’ We have been working with the FA and the football club to progress the matter appropriately. Having . reviewed the circumstances of the incident it has been agreed that the . matter will be dealt with by the FA rather than considering any criminal . proceedings. There has been no complaint received from the player involved or Hull City Association Football Club at this time. Whilst . we appreciate that some people may have found the behaviour displayed . at the game on Saturday offensive, Humberside Police will not be taking . any further action.' It was only recently that the club dismissed reserve-team coach Willie Donachie amid allegations that he struck a player, understood to be 19-year-old defender Remie Streete, and the pressure could mount on the club to be just as tough. FA chairman Greg Dyke has already described it as a ‘serious’ issue while leading figures in the game have said Pardew’s position is ‘untenable’. When the then Blackpool manager Paul Ince was punished for physically confronting the fourth official in the tunnel at Bournemouth earlier this season, he was hit with a five-game stadium ban. A 10-game ban for Pardew would see . him miss the rest of the season with matchday duties switching to . assistants John Carver and Steve Stone, leaving Newcastle owner Mike . Ashley looking at the long-term repercussions. The . controversial owner, who gave Pardew an eight-year deal last season, is . understood to have acted swiftly on Saturday evening in an attempt to . draw a line under the incident and end speculation that he intends to . sack Pardew. But Ashley . holds a review of all aspects of the club at the end of every season . and Pardew’s behaviour is certain to come under scrutiny despite him . being almost certain to provide the top-half finish which was his target . for this season.

From above: Pardew (centre) looks on from the stands as Newcastle secured a 4-1 win . Opinionated: Alan Shearer, who managed Newcastle in 2009, slammed Pardew for his headbutt . Newcastle United are disappointed with the actions of its manager Alan Pardew this afternoon (Saturday, 1st March). His behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of Newcastle United. It is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the Barclays Premier League. Sadly, the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players, but instead on the actions of our manager. Alan unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player, to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle United. We have held discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behaviour today and also a Club fine of £100,000. The Club is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment. The Newcastle manager fined himself last month for a foul-mouthed attack on Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini. At the start of last season he pushed a linesman in the back and was involved in an ugly row with ex-Sunderland boss Martin O’Neill during the Tyne-Wear derby. On Sunday even Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers’ Association, could not defend Pardew. Bevan was keen to stress that the second longest-serving manager in the Premier League was ‘extremely sorry’, but having spoken to Pardew, he said: ‘The buck stops with Alan. It’s unacceptable, it’s inappropriate and it’s insupportable from every perspective. Not happy: Arsene Wenger took issue with Pardew's celebrations as West Ham beat Arsenal 1-0 in 2006 . Heated: Martin O'Neill took exception to Pardew's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 Tyne-Wear derby . Frankly, I was shocked and disgusted by Pardew’s incredibly irresponsible action. And yet, and even more disturbingly, I wasn’t completely surprised. Pardew has a lot of previous, a lengthy list of touchline bust-ups and misbehaviour. When manager of Ipswich Town, I had personal experience of Pardew’s touchline impropriety during a play-off semi-final with his then club West Ham. I was alarmed, to say the least, by the way he tried to influence the officials. 'Alan knows that. He immediately realised . the serious error, made sincere apologies to all parties. But Alan does . need to think about how not to put himself in that position again.’ Pardew has said he would have to ‘sit down and stay out of the way’ rather than roam his technical area. Bevan nevertheless believes certain issues need to be addressed. Bevan told Sportsmail: ‘We did a technical report last year. Now we are working on a second report. I don’t mention this now because of Alan but because it is an important project. 'There can be too much traffic in the technical areas and sometimes problems arise because of that.' Hot water: Pardew called Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini a 'f****** old c***' in January . Best of pals: Barton, who has often found himself in trouble for acting out, came out in Pardew's defence . Spitting feathers: Pardew was banned for two matches after pushing a linesman against Tottenham in 2012 . Room with a view: The Newcastle boss was banished to the St James' Park stands after the push . November 2006: Pardew had earlier in the year criticised Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger for failing to field an English player in the Champions League match against Real Madrid and matters came to a head in West Ham's 1-0 win over Arsenal. Then West Ham boss Pardew's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate Wenger, who claimed he was 'provoked in a disrespectful way', with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official. On this occasion, it was the Gunners boss who was fined by the Football Association, with Pardew cleared of all charges. March 2012: In a Tyne-Wear derby, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over, with Pardew, now Newcastle boss, clashing with Martin O'Neill following his celebration to Shola Ameobi's late equaliser in a heated match. Both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future. August 2012: Pardew came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour 'ridiculous' when he shoved linesman Peter Kirkup in the Magpies' season opener against Tottenham after disagreeing with the official's decision to award Spurs a throw-in. Pardew once again apologised for his actions but the Football Association took a dim view and hit him with a two-match touchline ban and a £20,000 fine. January 2014: Pardew became involved in another touchline row, less than a month after having heated words with Southampton boss Pochettino, with Manchester City manager Pellegrini. Television cameras clearly showed the Newcastle boss launching an expletive-laden volley at the Chilean. Pardew was spared punishment but said later: 'It was a heat of the moment thing, words we always have as managers, to a degree. I've apologised and I'm fortunate that he's accepted that.'","Alan Pardew charged with improper conduct for butting David Meyler .

ff090d4e217d5d4f3cfe9a81a05705bc9bda5d68,"(CNN)In honor of the Oscars, this story will be 7,633 words long, padded out with flowery phrases and belabored metaphors, leavened with a surprise adjective or two and summed up by a yawning and expected conclusion. Just kidding. Well, at least about the number of words. We can't promise anything about the rest. But that's the thing about the Oscars. So much of what they present (and represent) is predictable: amusement and pageantry, self-importance about the role of movies and occasional stretches of dullness. (Well, there ARE 24 awards to give out.) Still, you never know when the show will surprise -- and even entertain. This year, for the 87th Academy Awards, the ""entertainment"" portion will be helped immeasurably by the inclusion of host Neil Patrick Harris, who has proven himself to be an all-star performer with his turns at the Tonys and Emmys. And a number of award categories -- including best picture -- are still undecided, unlike recent years when many top winners seemed preordained. So grab some popcorn and an Oscar ballot. Here's what you can expect from this year's show. Who should win an Oscar? Cast your vote . Joan Rivers is gone. The comedian and longtime red-carpet maven died last September, and love her or hate her, she always added some zip to the red-carpet procession, from popularizing the question ""Who are you wearing?"" to calling out faux pas on ""Fashion Police."" This year's red carpet -- coverage begins at 7 p.m. ET -- is less colorful for her loss. Nevertheless, plenty of color (and color commentary) will remain. Ryan Seacrest and Giuliana Rancic are hosting on E!, while ABC will trot out Robin Roberts, Lara Spencer and Michael Strahan. The weather forecast calls for a partly cloudy day with temperatures in the mid-60s and a 10% chance of rain. Sparkling Oscar weather, in other words. When Neil Patrick Harris hosts your show, you know you're in for a good time. His song-and-dance moves at the Tonys -- which he's hosted four times -- have earned raves. And though the 2013 Emmys proved unexpectedly dull, he wasn't blamed. So now Doogie Howser is hosting the Oscars. It won't be Harris' first time on the Academy Award stage -- he opened the show in 2010 -- but it's his debut as the show's emcee. He's aware of the challenges. Ellen DeGeneres did a good job last year, but all anyone remembers is her selfie. And Hugh Jackman, another ace song-and-dance man, hosted the show in 2009. He got nice reviews. Recall anything else? ""In many ways, it's lose-lose,"" Harris told the Los Angeles Times. ""There's so much scrutiny. And so much anticipation, and so many (Oscar-viewing) parties where people are hoping that things go wrong. It's not really an audience wanting you to win."" The 42 people scheduled to hand out awards Sunday range from 80-year-old Shirley MacLaine to 18-year-old Chloe Grace Moretz, from perennial nominee Meryl Streep to newcomer Ansel Elgort. Perhaps in an effort to appeal to younger viewers, only five of the presenters are over 50. And the academy may be mindful of complaints this year about the all-white slate of acting nominees. More than one-quarter of the scheduled presenters are black, including Oprah Winfrey and perceived best actor snubee David Oyelowo, both from ""Selma."" Yes, reading off lists of nominees can be a little dull. So who's going to bring the funny? We're pinning our hopes on Kevin Hart, Jason Bateman and Eddie Murphy. Count on Oscars for Julianne Moore (best actress, ""Still Alice""), J.K. Simmons (best supporting actor, ""Whiplash"") and Patricia Arquette (best supporting actress, ""Boyhood""). After that things get less predictable. Best actor is a two-way race between sentimental favorite Michael Keaton (""Birdman"") and upstart Eddie Redmayne (""The Theory of Everything""). And best picture? ""Birdman"" appears to have a slight edge over ""Boyhood,"" with ""The Imitation Game"" as a long-shot contender. Some people think ""American Sniper's"" blockbuster status gives it a chance, but liberal Hollywood may be loath to reward a movie so beloved by right-wing America. Oscars 2015: Who will win and who should win . If you're looking for a full slate of predictions for your Oscars pool, Gold Derby is a pretty good handicapper. By now, after the Golden Globes, the SAG Awards and other awards shows, we have some idea of what the front-runners might say if they win. Based on recent history, Keaton may get teary and thank his handsome son Sean, while Redmayne and Moore might dedicate their awards to people coping with ALS and Alzheimer's, respectively. Arquette might mention her lineage as a descendant of actors, and Simmons may thank ""Whiplash"" co-star Miles Teller for how he ""inspired me every day to want to scream at him and hit him in the face."" In recent years, the academy hasn't really known what to do with the songs. Occasionally they're a highlight -- Bob Dylan's ""Things Have Changed"" and Robin Williams' ""Blame Canada"" come to mind -- but, more often, they're an excuse for a bathroom break, or not performed at all. This year features five songs with intriguing back stories. You've got ""Glory,"" the gospel-tinged Common-John Legend collaboration that's one of just two nominations received by ""Selma""; Tegan and Sara's puckish ""Everything Is Awesome!"", the only nomination for ""The Lego Movie""; ""I'm Not Gonna Miss You,"" a wrenching swan song from the Alzheimer's-stricken Glen Campbell; ""Grateful,"" from the overlooked ""Beyond the Lights"" but written by the anything-but-overlooked Diane Warren; and ""Lost Stars,"" from ""Begin Again,"" which was directed by ""Once's"" John Carney and performed by Maroon 5's Adam Levine.

Bills for long-term care in old age are to be capped at £75,000 in England, in a £1billion move to be funded by dragging more people into the inheritance tax net, it was announced today. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that the 'historic' reforms would save thousands of people from having to sell their family home to pay for care and give them  'greater peace of mind'. 'We need to become a society where people prepare and plan for their social care costs as much as they prepare and plan for their pension,' he said, adding that all governments have 'long failed to tackle' the issue. Scroll down for video . Announcement: Heath Secretary Jeremy Hunt makes a statement to MPs in the House of Commons in central London where he said that that elderly care bills are to be capped at £75,000 . 'Whilst there are many other things . that need to be done to prepare for an ageing population, these reforms . do herald a historic change in the way that care and support is funded . in this country.' The inheritance tax threshold will be . frozen until at least 2019 to help fund the £75,000 cap on care home . bills for the elderly. It means that thousands more middle-class . families every year will be dragged into paying the 40 per cent tax. Sources . close to Chancellor George Osborne confirmed that some of the funding . for radical reform of social care will come from an unexpected freeze in . the amount people can inherit free of tax. Stealth tax? Sources close to George Osborne say the inheritance tax threshold is to be frozen to fund a £75,000 cap on care home bills . The move risks angering Conservative MPs . who remember Mr Osborne pledging in 2007, before the financial crisis, . to increase the threshold to £1million. Instead it has been fixed at £325,000 since the election and will remain at that level until at least April 2019. The Coalition will announce today that the state will fund all social care for any individual once the £75,000 cap has been reached. The state will also begin to help with costs if a person’s savings and assets fall below a threshold of £123,000, rather than £23,250 at present. But the National Pensioners Convention argues that the £75,000 cap is too high and warns that elderly people will continue to lose their homes as they grapple to meet mounting care costs. The reforms are expected to cost £1billion a year, 80 per cent of which will come from increased employer national insurance contributions – mainly in the public sector – as a flat-rate state pension replaces the state second pension. But the remaining 20 per cent will come from the inheritance ‘stealth tax’. If the threshold for the tax, frozen since 2009, increased in line with inflation every year until 2019 it would be expected to reach £420,000. But instead it will be fixed at £325,000 – although just two months ago the Chancellor suggested he would increase the allowance in two years. As a result, 5,000 more families a year . are expected to be pulled into the inheritance tax trap, and will pay an . average of £95,000 more than they would have done if the allowance had . been increased. George Osborne's pledge in 2007 . A Government source said: ‘The result of the social care reforms will be that 100,000 people who would have had to pay will be helped. The inheritance tax allowance has been frozen since 2009, but it’s also been made transferable so a couple now has a threshold of £650,000. ‘Yes, it will bring 5,000 more people into inheritance tax but it will help more than 100,000 who currently suffer for daring to do the right thing and saving for retirement. ‘Those who have worked and saved all . their life and bought a property won’t have it taken away just because . they did the right thing. That’s only fair. ‘We are going to protect their inheritance.’ Hit with taxes: Ros Altmann (right), a former adviser to the Treasury on pensions, said well-off pensioners with expensive houses would be hit by the inheritance tax changes while Peter Bone (left) said it looks as if the Government is 'giving with one hand, and taking away with the other' However, Conservative MPs expressed alarm. Right-winger Peter Bone said: ‘It starts to look as if we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other.’ The Coalition is setting the £75,000 cap despite the Dilnot Commission, established by Government to review care funding in England, recommending a lower benchmark. The commission proposed a cap of between £20,000 and £50,000 and said £35,000 would be 'the most appropriate and fair' figure. But chairman Andrew Dilnot said the difference between the recommendation and the Government's figure is not large enough to create problems. He told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'We said it should be between £20,000 and £50,000 in 2010-11 prices. 'The cap being proposed is £75,000 in 2017 prices, that’s the equivalent of £61,000 in our terms, £11,000 higher than the top end of our range. 'But I recognise that the public finances are in a pretty tricky state and it doesn’t seem to me that it is so different as to radically transform the basis of the system.' But Dot Gibson, general secretary of the National Pensioners Convention (NPC), said: ‘People are still going to lose their homes to pay for this, £75,000 is a hugely high cap. 'In actual fact, Dilnot said 35 or 50. But in any case, we didn’t think Dilnot was the right answer either because it doesn’t deal with the actual care system.' Ms Gibson called for a 1.5p in the pound income tax to pay for a national care system 'free at the point of delivery'. Neil Duncan-Jordan, also from the NPC, said he could see little difference between the freezing of the inheritance tax threshold and Labour’s plan before the election for a ‘death tax’ to pay for care. Ros Altmann, a former adviser to the Treasury on pensions, said relatively  well-off pensioners with expensive houses – particularly in the South-East – would be hit by the inheritance tax changes. ‘Many people who end up not needing any expensive care in their old age will end up paying lots of inheritance tax to those who do,’ she added.","It means thousands of middle-class families will have to pay 40 per cent tax .

The pound hit its highest level for nearly three years yesterday, and shares ended 2013 on the front foot in a vote of confidence for the British economy. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip companies rose 17.82 points to 6749.09, taking total gains for the year to £200billion – an increase of around 14 per cent. The pound also performed well, going up around half a per cent to $1.6565 and €1.2022. Boost: The pound goes into 2014 at its highest level in almost three years . Rollercoaster: The Footsie edged up another 18 points from 6,731 today to end the year at 6,749. Sterling is now at its highest level . against the dollar since April 2011 having clocked up a second year of . gains – although this could make Britain's exports less competitive. Last . year also saw the best London stock market results since 2009, boosting . the value of pension pots and investments for millions of workers and . savers. The stock market and . the pound benefited from stronger than expected growth throughout 2013, . as the economy finally emerged from the doldrums. The . UK economy looks set to have grown by around 1.5 per cent in 2013 and . could grow by as much as 3 per cent in 2014, according to analysts. That . would be the best performance since 2007 when output rose by 3.4 per . cent before crashing in the recession of 2008 and 2009. It . would also put Britain among the best-performing developed economies in . the world, well ahead of European rivals Germany and France. The . brighter outlook – and the sharp fall in unemployment to 7.4 per cent, . its lowest level since early 2009 – has fuelled speculation that an . interest rate rise is on the way. The . Bank of England has pledged not to raise rates from the current . all-time low of 0.5 per cent until unemployment falls to 7 per cent or . lower. Governor Mark Carney has insisted that 7 per cent is a . 'threshold' and not a 'trigger' for an automatic rate hike in a bid to . dampen expectations. But the . surge in the pound – which benefits from higher interest rates – . suggests many in the financial markets believe a rate hike is coming. Soaring: The FTSE 250 is up by almost a third this year. Sterling has jumped from below $1.49 in July when Mr Carney succeeded Lord King as Governor – a rise of more than 10 per cent. Howard . Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight, said: 'After some extended . gloom, 2013 was a year of mainly positive surprises for the UK economy.' Mr Archer believes . unemployment will hit 7 per cent during the second quarter of 2014 and . could be down to 6.7 per cent by the end of the year. But he played down . the prospects of a rate hike this year. He . said: 'Expectations are mounting that the Bank could start to raise . interest rates in 2014. However, the Bank will want to give the economy . as much chance as possible to establish broad-based growth and is more . likely to hold off from raising interest rates until the first half of . 2015.' Debenhams issued a profit warning yesterday following a nightmare Christmas which forced it to launch early sales and deep discounts. Britain's second-biggest department store said profits are expected to be down by 26 per cent in the first half of its financial year to around £85million. The chain is slashing prices by 70 per cent in its January sale in a desperate attempt to shift leftover Christmas stock. The news saw the retailer's share price fall more than 10 per cent in early trading yesterday, wiping £140million off its stock market value. City analysts believe sales in many leading chains were below expectations over the crucial festive trading period. As a result, shares in the likes of Marks & Spencer, Next, Primark, Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons have all been marked down in recent days. Debenhams' bosses described festive trading as 'extremely difficult' and competitive, with a large number of early sales. 'We did not experience the anticipated final surge in sales in the last week of the period and as a result we expect the need for additional markdown to clear stock in January and February,' they said. The five-year cost of living squeeze, bad weather and a shift to internet shopping have combined to pile pressure on retailers who rely on their bricks and mortar outlets. Major chains were forced to bring forward sales and bargain promotions ahead of Christmas during what one industry insider described as 'a bit of a bloodbath'. The gloomy trading update comes just days after reports that Debenhams was under pressure to axe its finance chief, Simon Herrick, amid shareholder concern over his performance.","2013 was the best year for the London stock market .

ff0adb7bb4281cba2fea1333fe7b44015f9ad57f,"London (CNN) -- What do artificial whiskers and coffee-filled balloons have in common? The answer is that they are both tools on experimental robots -- but they are also being put forward as possible ideas to help future planetary explorations. ""Shrewbot"" is the latest in a line of robots developed by teams at the UK's Bristol Robotics Laboratory (BRL) that aims to test whether artificial whiskers could help a robot find its way around. Inspired by the Etruscan shrew -- one of the world's tiniest mammals -- scientists wanted to find out if a robot could explore its environment using touch instead of vision, just as rats, mice and shrews find food in the dark. Team leader Martin Pearson, who works at the Biotact project, said the research was primarily to assist biologists in their understanding of how an animal's touch sensing works. But he added: ""Future robotic applications for this kind of sensing could be in search-and-rescue robots operating in smoke filled buildings or for sub-sea pipeline inspection robots in the murky depths of the sea."" The idea has also been suggested as a way to explore planetary surfaces where there is limited vision. Speaking at a space conference at the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, robotics expert and co-founder of the BRL, Alan Winfield, identified it as one of a number of advancements that might be useful to space scientists planning future missions. ""I was speculating that whiskers could provide a planetary rover with the ability to feel its way around,"" he told CNN. ""It may be that certain types of geology would be helped if you could, for instance, run the whiskers across the rock sample because you can get texture from whiskers. ""You can also imagine planets with thick, heavy atmospheres where vision would be completely useless. One of the beauties of whiskers is that the whisker can get damaged but still works -- all the sensing is done at the root."" Winfield also pointed to research carried out by Cornell, the University of Chicago, iRobot Corp and Liquidia that produced a robotic gripper using coffee granules and a latex party balloon. It exploits the way vacuum-packed coffee is rigid until the seal is broken and then the coffee granules can flow, adapting to the shape of an object it is pressed against. The vacuum can then be restored and the balloon 'jams' solid to form a grip. Watch how the gripper works at Cornell Creative Machines Lab . In 2010 ""jamming gripper"" researcher Heinrich Jaeger described in the Cornell Chronicle how the project had ""opened the door to applications none of us had originally thought about."" One of those applications, Winfield suggested, is a potential alternative for gathering samples on a planetary rover mission. ""Almost any planetary exploration robot is likely to need a gripper to pick up or collect rock samples for analysis or collection,"" he said on his blog. ""Something like the Jaeger-Lipson coffee balloon gripper would -- I think -- provide a much better solution. This soft gripper avoids the hard control and computation because the soft material adapts itself to the thing it is gripping."" Speaking to CNN, Jaeger said it would be exciting to work with space scientists. ""It's wonderful to see engineers and researchers come up with new ideas based on granular jamming. ""The main advantage of the jamming gripper is that it can deal effectively with very irregularly shaped objects and needs to cover only a fraction of the sample's surface in order to hold on to it. ""Perhaps even more importantly for a rover mission on Mars -- there are no mechanical parts that can get clogged up by dust. ""A third advantage is that the gripper is exceedingly gentle. It will put very little stress on the object to be gripped because it distributes the holding force over a large contact area that very closely conforms to the object's shape."" Winfield said this new field of ""soft robotics"" could be well suited to space exploration, explaining that the BRL is now working on touch sensors for robots. ""It's easy to see that giving planetary robots touch sensing could be useful, but there's another possibility ... the potential to allow Earth scientists to feel what the robot's sensor is feeling,"" he told CNN. Looking further into the future, Winfield believes so-called swarm robots -- large groups of simple robots that work together like social insects -- ones that can self-assemble and adapt to the environment in the way living creatures do, could also aid scientists exploring new worlds. ""Imagine that robots can actually remake parts of themselves -- we can't even do that in the lab yet -- but in theory you can imagine robots that can adapt their physical shape as well as their behaviors to meet a particular environment ... it's almost like evolution except these are mechanical devices,"" he said. However, he also believes that this technology -- along with fully autonomous robots that can think for themselves -- is a long way off. ""This field is very much a concept that we are developing in the lab -- I wouldn't expect these swarms of robots in space any time soon,"" he said.","""Shrewbot"" aims to test whether artificial whiskers could help a robot navigate .

ff0af7c87cd71ce57b2d25c2fb63f16d7f8f5886,"Never-before-released Interviews with veteran female CIA officers have given a fascinating insight into women's lives at the heart of the hyper-male and intrinsically secretive world. The four officers, who started as low-ranking typists and ended up in charge of international CIA branches, were asked about what it was like to be a woman working in the CIA in the 1960s and 70s. The riveting conversations were declassified by the CIA on October 30. Often facing rampant sexism and stigma, the officers proved invaluable to the agency. On one assignment, an embassy bomb plot was thwarted after an enemy operative divulged secrets to a female agent because she was 'just a woman who wasn't very bright'. CIA clerks and typists pictured in 1952. Recently declassified interviews with female operatives have revealed what it was like for women in the early years of the agency . One agent Meredith (last names are redacted in the lengthy interviews) describes how she joined the agency in 1979 because her husband was an ops officer. She began as a 'contract wife' - employed in low-paid secretarial work to support her husband's role. Meredith, who at the time she was interviewed was deputy chief of the CIA's European Division,  pointed out that having an eye for luxury clothing gave her an edge when trying to spot the foreign surveillants working undercover. She said: 'I always said if I ever wrote a book, I would start it with ''You could tell 'em by their socks''. You would always know surveillants [redacted word] at the time by the socks and shoes. 'We digress here, but with all the [redacted word] having such horrible clothes and horrible shoes and socks, the surveillants had good ones. 'That would never occur to my husband to look at it.' The foundation of spying: A 'make-up compact concealment device,' from the undated CIA archives . Another interviewee Patty described the role of wives in the 1970s as 'contract slaves' but agreed with Meredith that women were better at detecting other surveillants. She said it was especially easy to spot them when they tried to go shopping undercover as 'they just can't fake it' in stores. Dressed to kill: An evening outfit of a female CIA operative which had in-built surveillance equipment . Patty, who was awarded the CIA's Distinguished Career Intelligence Medal in 2004, said: 'I always put that down to women [being] . more sensitive [to] who's near or in their space, for physical . protection.' Another CIA agent Carla explained that one enemy operative revealed to her a plot to blow up an embassy simply because he underestimated her as a 'just a woman who wasn't very bright' while she was on assignment. Carla, who joined the CIA in 1965 and was Deputy Chief of the Africa Division when she retired eight years ago, said: 'I got credit for a recruitment but I never actually had to pitch the guy. 'Anyway I was sort of the ''Dumb Dora'' personality to survive, and ''Golly'' ''Gee!'' and ''Wow!'' 'And this [redacted word] that was it, he would seek me out. ''Oh, could we talk?'' He would tell me, ''I just love talking to you because you're not . very bright.'' 'And I would just sit like this [makes an innocent . expression], and I would get home and my spouse would say, ''Well how was it?'' ''Golly! Gee! You know? Wow!'' Carla continued: 'But it worked. And finally, unfortunately, the recruitment ended because he told me about a plot to bomb the embassy [redacted word] and we arrested him and his gang of merry men as they crossed the border. 'He just told me everything and I . got tons of intel out of him because I was just a woman who wasn't very . bright.' Women were initially hired in low-paid roles at the CIA to do secretarial work sometimes in support of their husbands who were agents . At times, female agents were often required to work undercover with gadgets straight out of a James Bond movie. Compact mirrors with pressed powder were adapted for surveillance and bugs implanted into glamorous evening gowns. The riveting interviews are part of a wealth of information recently declassified by the CIA as a collection entitled 'From Typist to Trailblazer: The Evolving View of Women in the CIA's Workforce.' With her string of pearls and cheerful grin, Eloise Page looks more like a church committee member than one of the CIA's most fearsome operatives. Miss Page (pictured above) began as a secretary during the Second World War at the Office of Strategic Services - the predecessor agency to CIA. She gained a wealth of counterintelligence expertise and at the end of WW2, was posted to Belgium in one of the first overseas CIA branches. She quickly proved to be a highly effective agent in the Clandestine Service. Miss Page rose through the ranks, eventually becoming the first female Chief of Station in the late 1970s - the highest foreign position. The Virginia native, a renowned expert on terrorist organizations, was known as 'the iron butterfly' by colleagues due to her character, 'a perfect southern lady with a core of steel', one remarked. She retired at the age of 67 in 1987 and passed away, aged 82, in 2002. On her death, then CIA director George Tenet said: 'From her earliest days of service with OSS, she was a source of inspiration to others. She will be forever.' The collection, most of which is being released for the first time, includes hundreds of studies, memos, letters and other official records documenting efforts to improve the status of women employees from 1947 to the present day. Part of the collection is documents from the 1953 'Petticoat Panel'. Despite women making up 40 per cent of CIA employees at the time (10 per cent higher than in the general U.S. workforce), only one-fifth of those women had even reached a mid-level salary grade - compared to 70 per cent of men. Family responsibilities and motherhood were seen as huge hindrances by CIA bosses at the time. Chief of Operations Richard Helms went as far as to say: 'You just get them to a point where they . are about to blossom out to a GS-12, and they get married, go somewhere . else, or something over which nobody has any control, and they are out . of the running.' Things had little improved by the 1970s, in particular in the Clandestine Service where, according to one memo, women were deemed 'limited in their operational potential'. Towards the end of the 1970s as women began to push through the glass ceiling in other industries, changes slowly crept in at the intelligence agency. In 1977, then-Deputy Director E. Henry . Knoche ordered a . gender-issues committee to address the lack of senior female employees. Today's CIA is a different world and popular culture is filled with no-nonsense images of female spies from Claire Danes as Carrie Mathison in TV show Homeland to Jessica Chastain's portrayal of 'Maya' - the female CIA agent credited with tracking down Osama bin Laden - in the movie Zero Dark Thirty. There is yet to be a female director of the CIA although things appear to be moving encouragingly in this direction. In 2011, 44 per cent of CIA employees at the top levels were women - up more than a third since 1980. In August, President Obama appointed Avril Haines as the CIA's deputy director - the first woman to ever hold that position. Yet limits still exist. Many women fall by the wayside due to the extreme demands of the job and its 'all or nothing' lifestyle. According to Mother Jones, the CIA analyst on whom Maya was based in Zero Dark Thirty was passed over for promotion last year.","Interviews with female CIA employees, who joined the lower ranks in the 1960s and 70s, reveal the sexism they endured .

A mother who claims doctors advised she abort her unborn son held her tiny newborn for the first time eight weeks after he defied the odds to survive a rare birth defect. When Vicky Davies was 20 weeks pregnant a routine scan revealed her son had the condition congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Doctors at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl told the 33-year-old her baby had a 50 per cent chance of survival. But despite his tiny stomach and intestines developing in his chest due to a hole in his diaphragm, Samuel Wilson was born on May 23 - five weeks before his due date. Vicky Davies was finally able to hold her tiny son Samuel for the first time, eight weeks after he defied the odds to survive a rare birth defect . Ms Davies, left with her son, claims doctors advised her to terminate her pregnancy, after revealing he had a 50 per cent chance of surviving at her 20-week scan when he was diagnosed with a rare condition, congenital diaphragmatic hernia . The defect caused a hole in his diaphragm allowing part of his intestines to push into his chest cavity . Now 10 weeks old, Samuel is being cared for in hospital as his parents and three siblings prepare to welcome him home for the first time next week. Mother-of-four, Ms Davies said: 'We went to find out if we were having a boy or a girl and our whole world came crashing down. 'We were told about his CDH and that there was a chance he would have Down’s Syndrome. 'Due to the low survival rate we were advised to look at the option of aborting the pregnancy. 'But I just couldn’t even imagine it. I know they have to give you all the options but I just had to give him a chance at survival.' Ms Davies and her partner Gavin Wilson, 40, were rushed from their home in Rhyl to Liverpool Women’s Hospital where Samuel was born weighing 4lb 15oz. He was placed in an incubator before his parents had the chance to hold their son. Ms Davies, said: 'We were told that it might not make it through the weekend, and six days after he was born we got a call at 1am to say they could do no more for him. Mother-of-four, Ms Davies said: 'Due to the low survival rate we were told to look at the option of aborting the pregnancy. But I just couldn't even imagine it. I know they have to give you all the options but I just had to give him a chance at survival' Samuel was born on May 23 - five weeks before his due date. Before his parents, Ms Davies and Gavin Wilson were able to hold him, he was placed in an incubator in the special care unit at Liverpool Women's Hospital . 'I ran to the ward. I thought I was going to have to leave the hospital without my baby. 'But Samuel has been fighting ever since. He has the operation to move his stomach and intestines down on June 10 and is even feeding through a bottle now.' After waiting eight weeks, Ms Davies is now able to hold her new born son. She said: 'I finally feel like a normal mum. It was so hard waiting but he was so poorly, I just knew I had to wait. 'My daughter Elisa, 10, has held him a few times, but my two boys Jack, seven, and Thomas, four, are still a bit nervous. 'They love him to bits though and come and see him whenever they can.' Samuel was first moved to Alder Hey hospital and is now in Glan Clwyd. He is expected to finally be allowed home next Wednesday, August 20. A spokesman for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, which runs Glan Clwyd Hospital,  said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases, as discussions between patients and their doctors are private. 'However, our clinicians would ensure that patients and families are aware of all available medical options in cases such as this.' CDH occurs in around one in 2,500 births and accounts for approximately eight per cent of all major congenital abnormalities. The diaphragm normally develops in an unborn baby by around the seven to 10 week gestation period. CDH occurs when the diaphragm fails to form correctly or fails to develop in the unborn baby. Now 10 weeks old, baby Samuel is ready to be taken home for the first time when he is discharged from hospital next week . It means the abdominal contents herniate into the chest cavity, which in turn prevents the lungs from developing properly. The stage at which the abdominal contents herniate, and the size of the hole in the diaphragm, determine how much the baby's lungs and other internal organs, including the heart, are affected. In some rare cases CDH is part of a chromosomal syndrome, including Down's Syndrome. The prognosis for babies diagnosed with CDH is 50 per cent. Once baby is fully stabilised and the Doctors are happy with baby’s blood gases, oxygen levels and general progress, baby will undergo surgery to repair the hernia, but there is no set timescale for when the operation is likely to take place.

ff0bbcbfcf1946f47fed2469909c01403af5a486,"It has been 16 years since Hearts and Rangers have arguably played in a match of such magnitude. It’s mere coincidence that the game would also be Ally McCoist’s last appearance as a player in the Light Blue. The Tynecastle club triumphed 2-1 on that occasion, lifting the Scottish Cup to end a 36-year trophy drought. Tomorrow, the stakes are rather different — as are the circumstances of both clubs. A win for either could go a long way to deciding the destination of the Championship title and an automatic ticket back to the top flight from which they had plunged in varying states of disarray. This fixture against Hearts is one Rangers boss Ally McCoist will see as a must-win victory for the Light Blues . Danny Wilson of Hearts scores his side's opening goal against Rangers in their 2-1 win at Ibrox in August . Gary Naysmith, who played in that victory for Hearts at Celtic Park back in 1998, knows the rival bosses well. He played alongside Robbie Neilson at Tynecastle, while Ally McCoist coached him at international level with Scotland. And the 36-year-old, currently player/manager of East Fife, believes a victory for his former side would pretty much seal the title before November is out. ‘It’s those two teams fighting it out at the top of the league and if Hearts win, I don’t see them losing a nine-point lead,’ said Naysmith. ‘It’s a massive game for Hearts because they have a great chance in front of 20,000 people to go nine clear after just more than a third of the season gone. But it’s an even bigger game for Rangers, because they know losing would see them fall so far behind. ‘I wouldn’t say Rangers have got a better squad and, with the players Robbie has assembled at Hearts, he would be disappointed not to win the league. ‘His priority at the start of the season would have been to get Hearts up but after such a good start, he will be wanting to go up as champions. ‘It’s all in Hearts’ hands and I think even a draw would suit them. Rangers need to win. So it’s going to be a cracking occasion and a definite sell-out. Ally McCoist looks on as his side prepare for what could be Rangers' biggest game of the season . John Robertson and Colin Cameron celebrate Hearts' cup win against Rangers at Celtic Park 16 years ago . ‘Depending on the result, though, the games between Hearts and Rangers later on in the season could be even bigger than this one as the points may be closer. ‘But you have to make Hearts favourites because they’re six clear and playing at home.’ Should his side lose tomorrow, there are those speculating it may signal the beginning of the end of McCoist’s colourful tenure as manager of the club he loves. In a three-year spell, the all-time Rangers record scorer has been lauded for his off-the-field firefighting while facing regular questions over his ability to lead his side on the park. Asked if he fears for McCoist’s future should they lose, Naysmith countered by insisting the 52-year-old has experience of dealing with such pressure. ‘The speculation is just the nature of the job,’ said Naysmith. ‘Rangers won seven on the bounce, then they draw against Alloa and all of a sudden Ally’s in the last-chance saloon. I think he’s probably immune to it by now. Water off a duck’s back. ‘While Rangers are in turmoil, they’re going to be front and back-page news. But Ally was used to being in the headlines as a player and it’s probably not that hard for him to cope with it. Hearts skipper Wilson will be looking for another win against Rangers in the return fixture at Tynecastle . ‘He doesn’t let it affect him. When we played them recently, he came in before the game for 40 minutes for a cup of tea and a chat. Ally always makes time for you. I don’t know if that’s normal or that he just likes me because of our time with Scotland but he’s just a guy I really respect. ‘I think he’s done a good job because he has been the glue that’s held that club together. I’m not sure anyone else could have done that. ‘Also, they are second in the league behind a very good Hearts side and, if they cut it to three points on Saturday, then it’s all to play for.’ Naysmith worked alongside Neilson at East Fife before he was headhunted by the Tynecastle club and the East Fife boss believes Hearts’ start to the season – 11 wins, two draws, no defeats – clearly marks him out as the coming manager of Scottish football. ‘It’s a fantastic achievement to be 13 games unbeaten,’ he said. ‘They have only conceded seven goals and scored 35 goals so it’s working for Robbie at both ends. ‘Gary Locke and Billy Brown deserve credit, too, for giving the younger players experience of the Premiership last season. Robbie is getting the benefit from that, as well as the changes he has implemented himself. ‘Undoubtedly, his director of football, Craig Levein, will have advised him to sign guys like Prince Buaben and Morgaro Gomis, who he has worked with before at Dundee United. But Robbie Neilson’s his own man and he’s gone up and up in coaching and deserves all the credit in the world.’ *Gary Naysmith was speaking to promote and H2-) event at Mountfleurie Primary School in Fife, in conjunction with Scottish Water and the SPFL Trust .","Hearts take on Rangers in Scottish Championship top of the table clash .

ff0c254794b58b1775ac1fe59cea7c63d51b2e6d,"Hayley Parsons, the founder of insurance comparison website GoCompare is to net £44m by selling her stake in the successful business . Eight years ago, Hayley Parsons sat at her kitchen table and sketched out a plan for a price comparison website. Today, the married mother-of-two is £44million richer after selling her shares in the company, GoCompare – best known for its adverts featuring ear-splitting opera singer Wynne Evans. The 41-year-old, from Cwmbran, South Wales, left school with six GCSEs and dreamed of becoming an interior designer. If she had succeeded, she says ‘today all the houses in the UK could be covered in animal print’. Instead, she took a job in a small insurance firm, where she made cups of tea and did basic admin. In her late twenties, she moved to Cardiff-based Admiral insurance where she worked in sales, and later helped launch the first UK motor insurance comparison site, Confused.com - the first car insurance comparison site in the UK. But after 14 years, Mrs Parsons – whose motto is ‘well-behaved women seldom make history’ – quit the firm and set up a rival site, a move she admits was ‘scary’. She and two former colleagues from Admiral worked from her kitchen table, later moving to premises where staff had to build their own Ikea desks. Her husband Mark gave up his job as a sales and marketing director to care for their two sons – aged four and 11 – when the company began to expand. Mrs Parsons was an unconventional boss, coming in dressed up as a devil on Halloween and setting up an office relaxation room, complete with a football table, a PlayStation and a Wii. Her company grew rapidly, and she was soon chief executive of a multi-million pound corporation. Last year GoCompare reported sales of £110million and pre-tax profits of £25million. Car insurance firm esure has owned half of GoCompare since 2010, when it exercised an option taken out in 2007 to buy a stake in the business. It bought the rest of the business in a £95million deal yesterday, including Mrs Parsons’ 23 per cent remaining stake. Ms Parsons wanted to employ a Welsh opera singer to star in television adverts for GoCompare . It had  valued the businesswoman's 23 per cent stake at around £44m. She sold it and stepped down as chief executive on the condition that the firm would keep the headquarters in South Wales. Mrs Parsons – who lives in an £840,000 five-bedroom home in Old St Mellons, near Cardiff – is now one of the richest businesswomen in Britain. 'I am very proud that a company I started at my kitchen table eight years ago has achieved so much in such a short period of time,' said Mrs Parsons. 'Today, we are a leading price comparison business in the UK and this is credit to all the wonderful, hard-working people we have in Newport.' She added that she has ‘done all right for a Welsh girl from the Valleys’. And she admitted that she had been lucky to have had the complete support of her husband, before joking: ‘I call him a house husband, and he calls himself a man of leisure, so we have debates over his job description.’ But despite her success, she says she does not live a champagne lifestyle and ‘can’t stand some of the people I meet in the business world, who think they’re important just because they’ve got money or they’ve got power or they’ve got a big title’. Ms Parsons set up the business in 2006 and it has become known for its adverts featuring an opera singer . She said: ‘I meet so many people in business who just get stuck up their own backsides and that’s not me at all.’ And when she was previously asked if she had ever faced challenges as a woman in business, she said: ‘I think that some women become transfixed with the “glass ceiling”. ‘I’ve always thought that if you believe there is a glass ceiling, you’ll spend your life on the floor looking up at it.’ As well as Ms Parsons, other selling shareholders in today's deal include GoCompare's employee benefit trust and current and former directors and staff. Jon Morrell, who is esure's deputy chief operating officer, will take over from Ms Parsons as GoCompare's chief executive. She added that esure's commitment to keep GoCompare's headquarters in Newport was an 'extremely important' part of her decision to sell the business. The deal, which is subject to Competition and Markets Authority approval, is expected to complete in the first quarter of next year. Find out more about Chwarae Teg here. Hayley Parsons was born in Cwmbran and grew up in the Valleys in Wales. She left Croesyceiliog comprehensive school in Wales at the age of 16 with five GCSEs. According to a recent Sunday Times Rich list the self-confessed 'Welsh girl from the Valleys' is now estimated to be worth around £95m. Ms Parsons lives in Rogerstone in Newport with her partner Mark and has two children, aged four and 11. She lives just a few miles from where she grew up in Cwmbran in a £840,000 five-bedroom home. The couple met in 2001 and as GoCompare took off, Mark quit his job as the sales and marketing director of a busy printing firm to stay at home with their eldest son. Speaking in 2010, she said: 'I call him a house husband, he calls himself a man of leisure, so we have debates over his job description.' In 1992 Ms Parsons got a job in sales at Cardiff-based insurer Admiral where she was to work for the next 14 years. During this time she quickly rose up the ranks. When she was 21 she helped set up an insurance broker called Gladiator and then was instrumental in the launch of the first car insurance comparison website, Confused.com by Admiral. In 2006 she left the company as she had always dreamed of running her own business and wanted to make a site that functioned better for customers. Ms Parsons then worked with a small team of two which grew to six to design GoCompare. She is known as a good networker and met a contact who offered £1.5m to invest in the fledgling business. Ms Parsons was awarded an OBE in 2012 . They moved into their own premises with a team of 20 who had to put their own Ikea desks together before Ms Parsons was forced to move the office again as the team grew to more than 70 people. In just eight years the company grew to employ around 200 people and was recently valued as being worth almost £195m. Ms Parsons worked with her team to come up with the idea of having Gio Compario for the adverts and wanted to employ a Welsh singer so chose Wynne Evans. In return for loyalty from her employees Ms Parsons has kitted out her offices with a relaxation room, complete with a Wii, Playstation and football table. GoCompare functions by listing insurance by the level of cover provided, rather than by the cheapest price. The site was invited to join the British Insurance Brokers Association (BIBA) in 2008. It is so popular it now provides a quote every second. The businesswoman was made an honorary fellow of the University of Newport in 2011. In 2012 Ms Parsons was awarded an OBE for services to the economy. During the same year Gocompare.com was awarded the Investors in People 'Gold' award. Earlier this year she was appointed to the Entrepreneurship Panel for Wales. Following speculation in recent years that Ms Parsons would sell the company she has referred to it as 'my baby.' Ms Parsons, now 41, said her staff were very important to her and a key part of the decision to sell was that the business would remain in Wales.","Hayley Parsons set up insurance comparison website GoCompare in 2006 .

ff0d02fc15a59cf9edd18aafe57320dea427baca,"(CNN) -- Manny Pacquiao's career will be defined by Floyd Mayweather, even if the Filipino can't give boxing the fight it has long been clamoring to see. That's the view of Sports Illustrated's boxing correspondent, Bryan Armen Graham. He says he is optimistic that Pacquiao and Mayweather can finally reach a deal to settle who is the best pound-for-pound fighter in the sport. Pacquiao's next fight is in May next year while Mayweather is due in court next month to answer charges of domestic violence. Should he retain his liberty, Graham thinks a showdown in December 2011 is a possibility. And according to Graham, the danger for eight-division world champion Pacquiao is that his legacy will be affected just as much by a failure to meet Mayweather in the ring than if the fight goes ahead. He told CNN: ""If Manny gets through his next fight scheduled for May 7 and if Floyd resolves his problems I think there is actually a good chance. I'm as optimistic as I have been in long time for that fight to come off late in the year, maybe December. ""But the truth is there are a lot of theories about Floyd maybe waiting for Pacquiao to be past his prime, like Sugar Ray Leonard did with Marvin Hagler in the eighties. ""Manny Pacquiao, I think he is a once in a generation type talent. I know there are people calling him greatest of all time and you always kind of rush to judge these things when you see someone so spectacular in their prime. ""Its really unprecedented what he is doing but I think we are probably going to have to wait until all is said and done until we really make judgments on his career. ""One thing for sure though is if the Floyd Mayweather fight doesn't happen he [Pacquiao] might be defined just as much for not having that fight."" Pacquiao, who is a congressman in the Philippines, is due to announce who his next opponent will be at his 32nd birthday celebrations on Friday with Shane Mosley, Juan Manuel Marquez and Andre Berto in the frame. Graham explained: ""There is Shane Mosley, the former WBA welterweight champion, Juan Manuel Marquez, the current WBO lightweight champion, and a dark horse candidate is Andre Berto, the former Olympian, who is undefeated but has not really fought anybody of note and has the lightest resume of the three. ""[Mosley] is the best known but at the same time he is also coming off two really bad performances. He lost 11 of 12 rounds against Floyd Mayweather in May and he had a very, very listless controversial draw [with Sergio Mora] in September. ""He is 39-years-old and he probably doesn't deserve a shot against the pound-for-pound champion, but deserves seldom has anything to do with it in boxing."" Pacquiao made history by becoming the first fighter to claim titles in eight weight divisions after his victory over Antonio Margarito secured the vacant WBC super-welterweight belt. According to reports in the Philippines, Pacquiao is currently ironing out a query over his taxes arising from fights in 2009. He recently moved his next fight from April to May due to his political responsibilities in the country.","Floyd Mayweather will define Manny Pacquiao's career even if fight can't be made, says pundit .

Eating white dirt is an ancient southern tradition that continues to be carried out to this day, mainly by women who crave the chalky white substance. The extraordinary phenomenon, known as geophagy, is the subject of a new documentary film, Eat White Dirt, which explores the curious culture of earth-eating that continues to thrive in parts of the South. The particular rock in question is called kaolin and can be found along the Atlantic Coast Fall Line that runs through southern states including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. Scroll down for video . Tammy Wright consumes around a pound of kaolin every day and claims it has helped her lose over 60lbs since she began eating it . Though the practice is rarely if ever recommended by medical professionals, some nutritionists admit the habit of eating clay may help absorb toxins . It is used medically to treat . diarrhea, dysentary, cholera, and is also used in paper making, paint, . fiberglass, porcelains and ceramics, china, and toothpaste. Though the practice is rarely if ever recommended by medical professionals, some nutritionists admit the habit of eating clay may have some real health benefits. ‘It is possible that the binding effect of clay would cause it to absorb toxins,’ Dr. David Katz, a nutrition expert at the Yale School of Medicine, told ABC News in 2005. Director Adam Forrester said he became intrigued by the tradition after he started to notice ‘mysterious little bags of white, chalky rocks’ for sale in many of the locally-owned convenience stores where he lived in Columbus, Georgia. Director Adam Forrester decided to explore the topic of white dirt after he found plastic bags of the stuff for  sale in convenience stores in Columbus, Georgia . ‘These Zip-loc bags, labeled “White Dirt” were most often for sale right at the front of the store, next to the register,’ he told Feature Shoot. ‘I’d never seen anything like that before. I would ask the clerks, “What is this white clay for?” They would reply, “Oh I don’t know, people eat it.”’ In Eat White Dirt, due to be released in the summer, Forrester examines the prehistoric origins of eating dirt, its medical mythology and the abiding relationship that people in the South continue to have with the peculiar mineral. Geophagy has been practiced by many different cultures from the ancient Greeks to Native Americans for centuries. In most places the habit is limited to women, especially women who are pregnant or of childbearing age. Tierra Griffin confessed that she stops by her local convenient store in Greensboro, Georgia, two to three times per week to purchase a bag or two . Kaolin is used medically to treat diarrhea, dysentary, cholera, and is also used in paper making, paint, fiberglass, porcelains and ceramics, china, and toothpaste . The practice is common in sub-Saharan Africa, and many anthropologists believe it was brought to the United States by African slaves. It is now most commonly found among African-American women in the rural South. Forrester interviewed several women who admitted to craving the taste of white dirt, which is typically described as ‘fresh, natural-feeling, like the rain or something’. 'I eat white dirt every day,' said Tammy Wright, who admitted to consuming about a pound of kaolin every day and claims it has helped her lose over 60lbs. ' I just had a craving for white dirt and I just started eating it and eating it and I've never stopped,' said Tierra Griffin, another kaolin lover. She confessed that she stops by her local convenient store in Greensboro, Georgia, two to three times per week to purchase a bag or two. The particular rock in question is called kaolin and can be found along the Atlantic Coast Fall Line that runs through southern states including Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama . According to Forrester, one of the greatest misconception about those who eat white dirt are extremely poor. ‘Most often this practice is erroneously associated with poverty. Dirt itself is considered the lowest of the low. 'We literally walk all over it daily. Many people assume that anyone that would be willing to put dirt - in all of its dirtiness - in their mouth must be incredibly hungry, and have no other option. 'This just simply isn’t true. I’ve met so many wonderful people who are practitioners of geophagy, or earth-eating, and most of them are living comfortable middle class lives. I’ve even met several Doctors of Philosophy that choose to eat white dirt as well,' he said. Some of other names that white dirt is known as are clay dirt, white clay, porcelain clay, china clay, chalk, or the scientific name of aluminum silicate hydroxide.","Eating white dirt is an ancient southern .

A £3.25million seafront home belonging to a former neighbour of football manager Harry Redknapp has been destroyed in a fire, killing its owner. Graham Cox, 77, died when the first floor of his home on an exclusive street in Poole, Dorset, was engulfed in flame on Wednesday afternoon. Firefighters battled the flames for several hours but could not save Mr Cox, a retired businessman. Burnt out: The luxurious seafront property in Poole, Dorset, was destroyed in a fire on Wednesday. Harry Redknapp used to live in the grey-roofed house to the left . Killed: Graham Cox, 77, who owned the £3.25million home, was killed in the fire . Rescuers had to wait 24 hours to retrieve his body after the four-bedroom house was left unstable by the blaze. Contractors working nearby had raised the alarm after spotting plumes of white smoke billowing from the roof of the property. The house, which was in need of modernising, was valued at £3.25million because of its sought-after location by Poole harbour. The property is just next to a home which used to be owned by Mr Redknapp, before he moved even further upmarket to the millionaire's Sandbank's estate just across the water. Investigation: Dorset Fire and Rescue have launched a probe into the causes of the fire . Battle: As many as 40 firefighters took on the blaze, and needed to wait 24 hours before entering the unstable house to retrieve Mr Cox's body . Outside: The entrance to the burned-out home can be seen to the left - and Mr Redknapp's old gates to the right . The house, which was in need of modernising, was valued at £3.25million because of its sought-after location in Sandbanks by Poole Harbour . Mr Cox and his wife Elaine, 71, had lived at the house for 33 years. It is thought Mrs Cox was not at the property at the time of the fire. Mr Redknapp and his wife Sandra lived in the luxury property next-door while the soccer boss was in charge of south coast side Portsmouth. Mr Redknapp sold his house for £2.9million  in 2006 and moved to Sandbanks, which has been described as the world's fourth most expensive location after Tokyo, Hong Kong and London's Belgravia. Dorset Fire and Rescue Service has launched an investigation into the cause of the fire. Former neighbour: Harry Redknapp used to live next door to the property, and now lives in Sandbanks, Dorset, where he is pictured above . Luxury: The Queens Park Rangers manager currently lives on the Sandbanks development, pictured, not far from the flame-stricken house near which he used to live . Relatives of Mr Cox, who is believed to have been unwell when the fire struck, paid tribute to him. In a message posted online, his niece Charlotte said: 'I would like to commend everyone that was involved in the rescue of my uncle in this tragic awful event that will scar my family forever. 'I would like to thank others for their kind words. He was an incredibly hard working man from a very hard working background and this loss will never go away. 'Thank you again to all that risked their lives to help in this truly sad sad accident.'

ff0f8dd06edf51b21a0c2d2bc6cc7bfc857d00e5,"(CNN) -- Sticks are the new boxes, at least when it comes to getting the Internet on your television. On Tuesday, Roku released its latest tool for streaming 1080p content directly to a TV. Like the $100 Roku 3 set-top box, the new $50 Roku Streaming Stick has a large selection of apps for streaming content, including all the major online services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Instant. The new Roku stick is about the size of a pack of gum and will be available in April. As game consoles, cable boxes and other bulky accessories pile up in living rooms, the smaller, more discreet stick approach is becoming an appealing choice for consumers who want to watch Internet content on their TV screens without adding to the clutter. This is not Roku's first foray into the stick form factor. But unlike its 2-year-old $90 version, the Streaming Stick will pop into any HDMI port, making it compatible with many more televisions. The Roku Streaming Stick will compete directly against Google's well-received Chromecast, released last year. The Google dongle costs only $35 and also plugs into any TV HDMI port. To watch Internet content on the Chromecast, you hit a button on compatible apps from an Android or iOS smartphone or tablet. Both sticks require a separate power source, either through a USB port on the back of the TV or by plugging into a wall. The Roku Streaming Stick will cost a few bucks more than the Chromecast but includes a dedicated remote control, like other Roku products. For people who prefer navigating with soft buttons to swiping a smartphone screen, this can be a big plus. Roku's biggest advantage is content. Because the service has been around for a while, it has many more streaming options than the Chromecast. There are currently about 1,200 available apps for Roku. Google recently opened up its Chromecast device to outside developers, so it's possible a wave of new content is on its way. For now, its big names are Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu, YouTube and Google Play, plus a handful of smaller apps. A third major competitor in the streaming-to-TV space is Apple TV. Apple's offering is still an old-fashioned box, but it could just be a matter of time before the company jumps on the stick-shaped bandwagon. It has more content options than a Chromecast but still lags behind the Roku. Of course, an Apple device would appeal to people already deep into the Apple ecosystem. Cable companies have been slow to update their set-top boxes, and smart TVs haven't caught on in the same way that easy-to-use Apple TV, Chromecast and Roku have. Roku is also working directly with television manufacturers to integrate its technology into their TVs.","Roku's new Streaming Stick is a small device that plugs into a TV .

A teacher who oversaw an art history lesson during which pupils cut themselves with blades has resigned from a £7,500 a year 'alternative' private school. The part-time teacher was suspended after pupils at Ringwood Waldorf School in Hampshire sliced themselves as part of the lesson, and later resigned from her post as school chiefs were investigating the incident. The fee-paying school, which follows the Rudolf Steiner model of education and aims to 'bring joy into the learning process', confirmed the teacher concerned had resigned ahead of a disciplinary hearing. Incident: The part-time teacher has resigned after pupils cut themselves during her art history lesson at Ringwood Waldorf School in Hampshire . Ringwood, which caters to pupils aged from three to 18, said the member of staff had acted without the knowledge of superiors. 'We can confirm an incident took place during an art history lesson on March 19 during which a part-time teacher, subsequently suspended pending a full investigation, acted independently without our knowledge,' school administrator Nigel Revill said. 'The teacher concerned resigned during the disciplinary process, before a disciplinary hearing could take place. 'The teacher is no longer employed by the school and we have no plans to reinstate her,' Mr Revill added. Ringwood has stressed the incident was an isolated one and said it is no longer under investigation. Alternative: Ringwood is one of more than 900 Steiner Waldorf schools worldwide (file photo) The teacher was reported to the School Inspection Service, which oversees independent schools, and to Dorset County Council's safeguarding team, Mr Revill said. He added that the school had been advised by both organisations it had taken the correct steps in informing them of the incident at the earliest opportunity. Fees for the school on the border of Hampshire and Dorset range from £3,610 to £7,500 per year. Ringwood is one of more than 900 Steiner Waldorf schools worldwide. The approach is based upon the principles of Rudolf Steiner, an Austrian philosopher and social reformer who identified three broad stages in child development - each around seven years long. In the early years Waldorf education focuses on providing practical and hands-on activities to encourage creative play, before moving on to developing pupils' artistic expression and social capacities. Developing critical understanding and fostering idealism is at the heart of secondary education at Waldorf Steiner schools. On its website Ringwood describes the curriculum as 'uniquely designed to meet the developing emotional and intellectual needs of children'. 'It works through the values of goodness, beauty and truth, encouraging children to seek these within themselves and in the world around, creating a warm and encouraging environment in which children can grow and learn,' it reads. The name Waldorf stems from Steiner's first school established in Stuttgart in 1919, which was for the children of employees at the Waldorf Astoria factory.","Part-time teacher suspended at Ringwood Waldorf School in Hampshire .

ff0f9801334d6f97b2b05c390a7313cfc3e64140,"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit challenging Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski's write-in election victory last month, clearing the way for Murkowski to be sworn in for a second term next week. State officials have scheduled a Thursday morning ceremony to sign the election certification, according to Sharon Leighow, spokeswoman for Gov. Sean Parnell. The certification will then be flown to Washington to be delivered to the Secretary of the Senate. Shortly after the ruling, Alaska's lieutenant governor, Mead Treadwell, announced that the director of the Alaska Division of Elections had certified Murkowski as the winner, but his office later retracted that statement. The final vote count in the election was 101,091 to 90,839. Murkowski was defeated in the Republican primary in August by Miller, a Tea Party-backed candidate. Murkowski then waged the write-in campaign in the general election in November to defeat Miller, who filed a lawsuit challenging the result. U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline had previously issued an injunction to block certification of the election results pending a resolution of Miller's lawsuit. In his ruling Tuesday, Beistline said ""the injunction is lifted and the Division of Elections may certify the election results immediately."" In Alaska, Beistline's ruling ""fully and finally resolved all claims raised by Mr. Miller and stated that they have absolutely no merit and no chance of success,"" said Scott Kendall, an attorney representing the Murkowski campaign. Miller said he was ""disappointed with the federal court's ruling,"" adding that he still believes his challenge is on solid constitutional ground. ""Thus, we are evaluating the ruling and determining what our next step should be,"" he said. Earlier this month, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the Alaska Division of Elections conducted the November 2 general election according to state law. Miller had claimed the way some votes were counted violated state law. In its ruling, the state Supreme Court affirmed an earlier Superior Court decision, saying: ""There are no remaining issues raised by Miller that prevent this election from being certified."" After the election in November, Miller filed a challenge against the Division of Elections to ensure the state law, which calls for write-in votes to match the name of the candidate, was followed. He has argued that Alaska law does not allow the counting of misspelled names on write-in ballots. However, the Division of Elections set guidelines before counting began that allowed for a voter's intent to be considered when determining whether to count a ballot for a write-in candidate. In the original Superior Court decisions, a judge ruled that Miller did not provide proof of election official fraud, or that ""there would be a sufficient change to the election results if these claims were true."" The Associated Press called the race for Murkowski last month when she had a lead of  more than 10,300 votes over Miller, a figure that included 8,159 ballots contested by Miller observers. Not including the contested ballots, Murkowski's lead still exceeded 2,100 votes.","NEW: The vote count is to be certified at a Thursday morning ceremony .

John McWethy, right, shares a laugh in 2002 with former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in Washington. A witness said McWethy, 61, was skiing fast on an intermediate trail Wednesday at Keystone Ski Resort when he lost control and slammed into a tree, said Joanne L. Richardson, the Summit County, Colorado, coroner. McWethy died while being treated for blunt-force injuries at Summit Medical Center, Richardson said. ""He just missed a turn and slid sideways is what we're surmising,"" she told CNN. McWethy was wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, she said. With his wife, Laurie, McWethy recently had moved to Boulder after nearly 30 years as an ABC News correspondent, so he could enjoy Colorado's ski trails, according to a statement from ABC News President David Westin. ""He was doing something that he truly loved,"" Weston said. ""But he deserved many more years doing it than he was given."" Friends and former colleagues described McWethy as an outstanding reporter who also cherished life outside work. ""He always knew without exception what so many in the powerful business of TV news fail to learn until it's too late: In the end, all we have is our families and our friends and our self-respect as news reporters,"" said CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr, who worked as a producer with McWethy for three years. Both Starr and former CNN producer Chris Plante admired McWethy's coolheaded reporting from the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, when a hijacked airliner punched a huge, fiery hole in the building's massive facade. ""He was unflappable even in the most extreme situations because he was always centered by his love for his family and the knowledge that the television news business and all of this Washington hoo-ha was not 'real life,' "" Plante said. ""Unlike so many, he really did have a handle on what life was for. And the last moments of his life are proof of that."" College classmate Bob Steele wrote about McWethy's ""mighty"" skepticism of authority in an article published online for the Poynter Institute. While they attended Depauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, Steele said McWethy ""challenged the University President and his policies. He protested against the Vietnam War."" Steele wrote that McWethy considered ""why"" to be ""the most powerful word in the English language."" Len Ackland of the University of Colorado's Center for Environmental Journalism told The Denver Post that his longtime friend ""was a very humble guy."" Ackland told the paper that McWethy ""didn't talk about himself much. He was the kind of journalist who didn't want to be out front. It was always about the story, not about him. He was the kind of guy you enjoyed sitting down to have a beer with."" McWethy left behind two sons, Adam, 28, and Ian, 24, according to the Post. His wife, who was with McWethy at the time of the accident, told the Post her husband was a good skier who enjoyed living in Colorado. ""He loved it here,"" she told the paper. ""I think he loved the beauty of its nature, the open spaces, the wildlife, everything."" In his statement, Westin said, ""He was one of those very rare reporters who knew his beat better than anyone, and had developed more sources than anyone, and yet, kept his objectivity."" After working as a reporter for U.S. News & World Report, McWethy joined ABC News in 1979, going on to cover conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo and Liberia, according to the ABC News Web site. McWethy was the network's primary reporter assigned to Secretaries of State James Baker, George Shultz, Warren Christopher and Lawrence Eagleburger, ABC said, and he had traveled to more than 50 countries. McWethy was honored with at least five national Emmys during his time at ABC and also received an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia Award and an Overseas Press Club Award, according to ABC News' Web site.

But he grew up as Alton Nolen, a good kid raised in a loving home, said a woman who identified herself as the mother of the Oklahoma beheading suspect in an online posting. Nolen, 30, is expected to be formally charged in last week's fatal attack at the Moore, Oklahoma, food processing plant from which he'd just been fired. Police accuse him of beheading one woman and attacking another before being shot by the company CEO, also a reserve deputy. Nolen was in stable condition Monday. Charges will include first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon, according to Jeremy Lewis, spokesman for the Moore police. The spokesman said Nolen was cooperative and forthcoming with detectives. ""He wasn't trying to hide anything,"" Lewis told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" Nolen allegedly told investigators that he felt oppressed at work -- particularly over not getting a raise, a law enforcement official said. While his Facebook page included images of Osama bin Laden and an apparent beheading, there's no indication that Nolen was motivated by terrorism, a second law enforcement official said. Whatever the motivation, the violent image was at odds with the one offered by those who said they were his sister, mother and friends -- none of whom said violence was part of his personality. ""My son was raised up in a loving home,"" the woman who identified herself as his mother said in a Facebook posting Sunday. ""My son was raised up believing in God. My son was a good kid. I know what they're saying he done, but I'm going to tell you this: That's not my son."" The video was posted to the Facebook page of a woman named Megan Nolen, who said she was Alton Nolen's sister. ""Alton, my brother, he's always been a great person, a loving person,"" Megan Nolen said in the post. ""He's always been a people's person, he's never been a violent person, so for something like this to have happened, we're all still in shock right now."" The brutal attack also seemed out of character to Karla Dunn, who was friends with Nolen's younger siblings, according to CNN affiliate KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City. ""He was really just a normal person,"" Dunn told the station. ""He was polite. If you asked him to do something, he did it. It was like no red flags actually that I could ever think of."" At some point, that no-red-flags life seems to have taken a turn. In 2006, CNN affiliate KOKI-TV in Tulsa reported, Nolen was arrested after a police officer saw him throw bags of crack cocaine and marijuana out a car window as he was being pulled over for traffic violations. Out on probation in 2010, he was stopped for an expired tag when a trooper learned he had outstanding arrest warrants, KOKI reported. He struggled with the trooper, then escaped only to be arrested 12 hours later, the station reported. In 2011, he was convicted on drug, resisting arrest and escape charges and sent to prison. In online prison records related to that incident, authorities note that in addition to a ""Jesus Christ"" tattoo on his chest and praying hands on his right arm, he had the Arabic words for ""peace be upon you"" tattooed on his abdomen. The Facebook page where Nolen posted under the name Yisrael -- confirmed by police to be his -- features a cover photo of fighters holding a machine gun and a rocket propelled grenade launcher. U.S. beheading suspect to be charged . It also features numerous messages related to Islam but offers no hint he was planning an attack or that it had anything to do with his religion. The law enforcement official who spoke to CNN on Monday said Nolen had watched beheading videos, but it was unclear if they were linked to ISIS. And another law enforcement official told CNN on Monday that there was no indication of a link to terror. Nolen's problems at work including getting in trouble for his performance and for trying to convert co-workers to Islam, the second official said. While it's unclear when Nolen himself converted, his Facebook page abruptly changed from posts featuring song lyrics, talk about football and other topics to posts almost exclusively related to Islam in April 2013 -- shortly after he was released from prison. Among the posts are screeds condemning the United States as ""wicked"" for failing to help Palestinians during the recent hostilities with Israel. His last post condemned masturbation. Leaders at the mosque he sometimes attended said he was quiet, not outgoing, and that there was no sign of violent tendencies in his personality, according to KOCO and The Oklahoman newspaper. ""The only time I ever said anything to him was one time,"" Saad Mohammed, spokesman for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City, told KOCO. ""He was in the mosque and he had his Quran and prayer rug on the floor. And I said, 'Hey, pick it up because I don't want the Quran on the floor.' And he picked it up and he sat down.

Imagine if you could find your perfect jeans without the endless trawl around denim stores trying on countless pairs. We've all been there - wrestling on pair after pair of jeans in cramped, overheated changing rooms in an attempt to find the Holy Grail of denim - the pair that will do the impossible of slimming, lengthening and lifting. Given that it's a Herculean task to ask of any item of clothing, it's no surprise that women try on an average of 15 pairs before settling on the perfect pair... Or giving up and going home. The Bodymetric scanner takes readings from 300,000 points all over the body, creating an accurate map of the body's curves and contours . Well, luckily for us, the High Street is beginning to sit up and listen. From today, customers at the New Look store at Westfield Stratford will be able to avoid the traumas of ill-fitting jeans (goodbye, gaping waists, too-short legs and baggy bottoms) thanks to the installation of a Bodymetrics 3D body scanner. Shoppers will strip to their underwear and step into the scanner, which is shaped like a photo booth. Low-power, infra-red lights will read more than 300,000 points all over the body. The whole process will take no more than 7 seconds. One hundred vital statistics can be gathered - from bottom, waist and hip measurements down to the size of the left ankle, thigh girth and inside leg. The Bodymetrics pods have become smaller and more compact thanks to advances in technology, meaning more stores across the nation will be able to accommodate one in their changing rooms . Once the customer has been scanned, a dedicated denim Fit Stylist will analyse the curves and contours of the body-mapping, using the information to pick and pick out the perfect pair - and hey presto, the jean genie's work will be done. The team will then email the customer their unique body map for future reference - based on the theory that as more stores implement the technology, the details could help with accurate fitting. The technology is not new - it first launched 2001, and was tipped to be the next major development for fashion brands, with many vowing to install them in their changing rooms. A Fit Stylist will analyse the body mapping results and use the information to pick out the perfect pair for the customer . At the time the technology was . launched, it was tipped to revolutionise the way we try on and buy . clothes. Ten years on though, the pods have not made their way to . fashion's front line in the way that was originally predicted. Then, upmarket department store Selfridges installed a pod in their own denim room  - but until now, that is the only Bodymetrics pod that has been available for consumers, and it has never reached the masses on the High Street. Behind the scenes, a handful of . companies - New Look included - have been using the technology in-house . to ensure uniformity of size for garments manufactured in factories . across the globe. Now though, Bodymetrics' CEO Suran Goonatilake says major advances in technology mean that vision could soon become reality. 'There's been a big leap in technology - new body scanners are smaller, cheaper and faster. 'Fashion is one of the few industries where no sizing standards exist. Size labels vary from retailer to retailer and from brand to brand, and one person can be as much as three different size labels in three different brands - for example, ranging between 8 and 12, because of the discrepancy. 'Soon, as more retailers take up the technology, Bodymetrics will allow you to discover what size you are in different brands. Furthermore, Goonatilake believes the body scanners could transform internet shopping. 'One of the key barriers in internet shopping is that because you can't try items on, returns are between 20 and 40 per cent of all garments sold,' he says. 'It's a real inconvenience for the consumer, and hits the bottom line of the retailer. 'It's not good for the environment in terms of transporting garments back and forth either. 'Our vision is that over the next few years, most retailers will have body scanners which will allow people to shop in store as well as online and help find clothes that fit perfectly their size, shape and style. 'Once you have your body scanned, it will be uploaded to your Bodymetrics account which can be accessed online, so you can shop for clothes knowing they're going to fit. Bodymetrics 3D body scanner will be in store at New Look Westfield from today until 1 November.

ff10bea6c04bd0aa40f42be2cd7677bce1775e83,"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The woman dubbed the 'poker princess' for her role playing hostess to the rich and famous at high stakes poker games has opened up about her illustrious clientele. A memoir of Molly Bloom's time running the most exclusive poker game in Hollywood entitled Molly's Game, set to be published next Tuesday, is sure to have her former clients - actors, athletes, politicians and financial titans - slightly nervous about her revelations. Last . month, Bloom, 36, pleaded guilty to illegal gambling and was . sentenced to 12 months probation and given a $1000 fine for her part in a high-profile gambling ring that attracted Hollywood heavyweights such as Ben . Affleck, Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon. Dishing the dirt: Molly Bloom, pictured in May, is opening up about her former life as the organizer of a high-stakes poker game . Valued for her discretion and paid generously for her confidentiality, Bloom was privy to some of the world's juiciest gossip. She told ABC's 20/20 that during her games, players had 'six-figure losses, six-figure wins,' and that she herself earned $4 million in one year alone. Tobey Maguire, she says, was a great player but a sore loser and worse tipper. 'I used to call Tobey ""Hannibal Lecter"" because he could just talk someone off of a good hand,' Bloom told 20/20. In an adaptation of her book published in Vanity Fair earlier this month, Bloom wrote that the Seabiscuit star once told her to 'bark like a seal who wants a fish' for a chip. Poker face: Tobey Maguire was allegedly a great player but a bad loser and worse tipper . Good will: 'Tall and handsome' Affleck was a regular player, said Bloom, while Matt Damon was polite and mild-mannered . 'I'm not kidding,' he allegedly said to her. 'What's wrong? You’re too rich now? You won’t bark for a thousand dollars?' The gambling goddess said that she refused to stoop to the level of barking, and that in return: 'He gave me an icy look, dropped the chip on the table and tried to laugh it off but he was visibly angry.' Maguire would use his close friend Leonardo DiCaprio to attract bigger players to the game, she said. Another way she placated demanding gamblers like Maguire, Bloom said, was to invite top sportsmen into the game. 'A-Rod was a novice player, but there’s something that happens to grown men, no matter how successful they are, when a professional athlete comes into the room,' Bloom said of baseballer Alex Rodriguez. Novice: Alex Rodriguez wasn't an experienced player, but his presence at the table thrilled the other gamblers . Poker princess: Bloom says that since 2011, she's returned to 'a life that has meaning and substance' and works for a friend's business earning $19 an hour . In her book, Bloom claims Pamela Anderson's husband Rick Salomon asked Ben Affleck: 'Did Jennifer’s ass have cellulite on it, or was it nice?' The Argo star is said to have held his silence for a moment before conceding, in front of a room full of celebrities, that 'it was nice.' Ex-girlfriends aside, Molly also writes that having Affleck involved in the games was 'monumental' and that 'he was tall and handsome with a relaxed charisma that not all icons have in person.' But Jennifer Garner's husband didn't go all-in too quickly, according to the Poker Princess. He was 'a smart player who liked to limit his downside,' with his buy-in being comparatively small at $50,000. His Good Will Hunting pal Matt Damon, she told 20/20, was nothing like his poker-addict Rounders character, and turned up only once. 'He was lovely, modest, down-to-earth, very gracious,' Bloom said. Titanic wins: Leonardo DiCaprio was a regular player in Bloom's circle, which had a buy-in of up to $100,000 . Molly also reveals that Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen were responsible for bringing in a billionaire to her table. 'When the Olsen twins showed up with a billionaire I was trying to land for a game, they were in, no questions asked,' she writes. Things fell apart for Bloom when she began demanding a cut of the pot, instead of just relying on tips, which turned her actions into organized crime. Bloom told 20/20 that when she declined the demands of two mobsters for a piece of her profits, she was beaten up in her own apartment by a hired goon. Soon after, one of her games was raided by the FBI and her bank accounts were frozen. Bloom told the court last month that since 2011, she had returned to 'a life that has meaning and substance.'","Molly Bloom, 36, pleaded guilty to illegal gambling last month .

ff10e263a67f5ed441e1ced608aada5914618add,"London (CNN) -- Significant progress was reportedly made last weekend in Geneva toward a landmark nuclear agreement with Iran. And, as talks concluded on November 10, U.S. Secretary of John Kerry announced that negotiations will start again on November 20. Despite the concerns of regional U.S. allies like Israel and Saudi Arabia, and also a significant number of legislators in the U.S. Congress, it is clear that the Obama administration is pushing strongly for deal as part of its wider Middle Eastern strategy. Indeed, Kerry has now spent more time negotiating with counterpart Iranian officials than any other U.S. high-level engagement for perhaps three decades. The seriousness of negotiations was emphasized by the fact that, as well as Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif, foreign ministers from Russia, the United Kingdom, Germany and France, and the Chinese deputy foreign minister, came together. If agreement can be reached, an interim deal (potentially setting the ground for a later comprehensive agreement) would reportedly see Iran's nuclear capacity capped for six months and opened up to U.N. inspections. In exchange, Iran would be given limited, sequenced relief from sanctions. Remaining disagreements reportedly include the status of the Arak heavy-water reactor, and production of highly enriched uranium -- both processes, that can potentially be used to produce nuclear weapons. A second problem to resolve is how to handle the existing Iranian stockpile of uranium that Iran enriched to 20%. IAEA signs cooperation deal with Tehran . Progress in nuclear diplomacy with Iran, combined with continued uncertainty in Syria and Egypt, has refocused Washington's attention towards the Middle East in a manner unanticipated by Obama only a few months ago. In addition to Syria and Egypt, the administration has spent significant political capital resuming Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The urgency of U.S. focus there reflects growing international conviction that, 20 years after the Oslo Process began, the ""window of opportunity"" for securing a two-state solution may be receding. Intensified U.S. focus on the Middle East has accentuated a shift, common to many recent re-elected presidents, of increased focus on foreign policy in second terms of office. In part, this reflects the fact that presidents often see foreign policy as key to the legacy they wish to build. For instance, after the 2001 terrorist attacks, George W. Bush sought to spread his freedom agenda across the Middle East. Bill Clinton also devoted significant time to trying to secure a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. As important as an Iran nuclear agreement might prove to be, the Middle East is one of only two regions in which Obama is looking for legacy. Since he was elected in 2008, Asia in general, and China in particular, has assumed greater importance in U.S. policy. To this end, Obama is seeking to continue the so-called pivot towards Asia-Pacific through landmark initiatives like the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Key threats, however, remain on the horizon to securing this re-orientation. These include a dramatic, sustained escalation of tension in the Middle East (perhaps in Syria or Egypt); and/or the remaining possibility of further terrorist attacks on the U.S. homeland. As well as legacy-building, the likelihood of Obama concentrating more on foreign policy also reflects domestic U.S. politics. Particularly the intense polarization and gridlock of Washington. Since re-election, Obama has achieved little domestic policy success. His gun control bill was defeated, immigration reform faces significant opposition in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, and the prospect of a long-term federal budgetary ""grand bargain"" with Congress looks unlikely. Moreover, implementation of his landmark healthcare initiative has been botched. Many re-elected presidents in the post-war era have, like Obama, found it difficult to acquire domestic policy momentum. In part, this is because the party of re-elected presidents, as with the Democrats now, often hold a weaker position in Congress. Thus Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, Richard Nixon in 1972, and Bill Clinton in 1996 were all re-elected alongside Congresses where both the House and Senate were controlled by their partisan opponents. Another factor encouraging foreign policy focus in second terms is the fact that re-elected presidents have often been impacted by domestic scandals in recent decades. Thus, Watergate ended the Nixon administration in 1974, Iran-Contra badly damaged the Reagan White House, and the Lewinsky scandal led to Clinton being impeached. Since Obama's re-election, a series of problems have hit the administration. These include revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted some conservative groups for special scrutiny; and the Department of Justice's secret subpoenaing of private phone records of several Associated Press reporters and editors in the wake of a terrorist plot leak. Even if Obama escapes further significant problems, he will not be able to avoid the ""lame-duck"" factor. That is, as a president cannot seek more than two terms, political focus will refocus elsewhere, particularly after the November 2014 congressional ballots when the 2016 presidential election campaign kicks into gear. Taken overall, Iranian diplomatic progress and wider recent events in the Middle East are therefore likely to accentuate the incentives for Obama to place increasing emphasis on foreign policy -- which Congress has less latitude over -- in his remaining period of office. And, this shift is only likely to be reinforced if, as anticipated, the U.S. economic recovery continues to build up steam in 2014. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Andrew Hammond.","Obama administration seeking Iran deal as part of wider Mideast strategy, says Andrew Hammon .

ff11258acc1c60b38622f35f9d7df4d12f29d183,"The Football Association will investigate Manchester United manager David Moyes' latest outburst against referees following Tuesday night's defeat to Sunderland in the Capital One Cup. The 2-1 first leg loss was United's third defeat in a week - the first time this has happened since 1992 - and Moyes claimed afterwards his team are 'playing referees as well as the opposition.' It follows on from Moyes saying it was 'scandalous' that United were not awarded a late penalty against Tottenham in a league defeat at Old Trafford on New Year's Day. An FA spokesman said: 'We are looking into David Moyes' comments to the media following the match at Sunderland.' Scroll down for video . Not a happy man: United boss David Moyes said his side had to play against the officials as well as Sunderland . Andre Marriner had no choice but to award Sunderland a penalty after his assistant Peter Bankes flagged that Tom Cleverley had tripped Adam Johnson just inside the penalty area. A referee can over-rule his assistant but given the relative positions of the two officials that was not credible. Although Cleverley’s contact was at most minimal, it was a silly challenge in a critical area and that forced Bankes to make a decision. Perhaps it was harsh but Manchester United’s reaction was over the top, with Ryan Giggs shouting at Marriner and Rafael picking up a yellow card for his protest. The Brazilian might well have seen red minutes later when making a rash tackle but Marriner wisely decided that the two offences did not merit a dismissal and left United with 11 players. After Fabio Borini's penalty consigned United to another defeat, Moyes . said: 'After the first 15 minutes I thought we were very good. We . defended a terrible free-kick, but how the referee has given a free-kick . for that is way beyond me. 'I . just cannot see how that is a free-kick. 'And the penalty? We had a . player booked for that theother day against Tottenham. The  referee is . in a great position to look  at it, down the line, 15 yards, and the . linesman gives it from behind and he cannot see through Patrice Evra. ‘That is what we’re finding at the moment. The performance was good without having the last bit. ‘I have experience and I can sense it’s on the verge of turning. I sense we’re about to get a bit better.’ More . than 5,000 Manchester United supporters were in the 31,547 crowd and . Moyes paid tribute to them and Ferguson, who left the Stadium of Light . through the Press room carrying a bottle of red wine. Moyes . added: ‘I can only see Alex as a great sounding board, a great help, . and so is Sir Bobby Charlton, he is  terrific. Bryan Robson is at the . training ground regularly. Spot of bother: Tom Cleverley brings down Adam Johnson and concedes a penalty . Making the call: Referee Andre Marriner points to the penalty spot . Not impressed: Patrice Evra argues with referee Marriner . ‘It’s . great 5,000 came up tonight and they were fantastic throughout the . game. They recognised how well their team had done for most of the game. ‘This . hasn’t happened at Man United for a long time. I thought the support . were great for sticking with their club, sticking with their manager and . that is exactly what you need when you are not doing so well. ‘We . need a couple of fair decisions. We had a couple of penalty kicks . against Tottenham and we have one given against us tonight for that. My . goodness, give me strength.’ Moyes will hope to have strikers Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie fit for the second leg. Not going to plan: United defender Nemanja Vidic looks dejected as his side lost for the third time in a week . All going wrong: Ryan Giggs gave Sunderland the lead with an own goal . But . there is more concern for the manager with United captain Nemanja Vidic . set to leave Old Trafford this summer after his agent said he is . unlikely to sign a new contract. Vidic’s . four-year deal runs out at the end of the season and talks over a new . one have stalled, with  Italian clubs Inter Milan, Fiorentina and Napoli . monitoring the situation.

Tuesday . night’s win for Sunderland was their first over United for 20 games. And manager Gus Poyet, whose side are bottom of the league, was at a . loss to explain their excellent cup form.

ff1177f82e7b9dd8020543a65fceab07ecbdae91,"(CNN) -- When world leaders gather in Rio Wednesday they will be hammering out a new set of goals to measure sustainable development. This time it's the SDGs (sustainable development goals) -- goals which will influence a new development framework. But before we rush to embrace another acronym, we need to tackle a basic injustice left over from the last development goals -- access to reproductive health. Across the world more than two in five pregnancies are unplanned. Clearly this is a wasted opportunity to boost development and stabilize population growth - through something women want and need, the ability to decide when to become pregnant. More: Africa's birth rate: 'Why women must be free to choose' Rapid population growth puts pressure on economies as governments struggle to provide education and health services, yet in many countries around the world women still have little choice when it comes to childbearing. More than 215 million women in the developing world who wish to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy are still not using an effective method of contraception. This unmet need highlights just how far reproductive health and rights have slipped off the agenda: just at the time when it should be key to the challenge of sustainable development. Reproductive rights and health services not only provide immediate health benefits and reductions in maternal and child mortality, but helps end poverty passed on from one generation to another and lightens the burden on countries with few natural resources. Experience has shown us that educating girls, legal reform and access to family planning have made all the difference in many countries. While it's true that economic and social development leads to women having smaller families, the converse is also true -- that the gains that contraception has made possible in women's health make family planning one of the most successful international development stories. In the words of Nafis Sadik, former head of the United Nations Population Fund, ""it is the freedom from which other freedoms flow"". The evidence continues to bear this out - family planning saves lives, contributes to the fight against HIV and AIDS and helps governments and communities achieve sustainable social and economic development. World Bank studies have found reproductive healthcare extremely cost-effective: an investment of US $4.10 per person could avert eight per cent of the global burden of disease. See also: Why family health makes moral and economic sense . Fully meeting the unmet need for family planning services would result in global unintended pregnancies dropping from 75 million to 22 million. This would result in 25 million fewer abortions, 22 million fewer unplanned births, and 680,000 fewer deaths among women and newborns. As a result, couples and individuals and communities will become more resilient - they will be better able to prepare for unpredictable events, including climate change disasters, and to adapt towards economic, social and environmental sustainability. See also: Mother's Day is not so rosy in Africa . That's why IPPF, the world's largest reproductive health and rights organization, will be vocal and visible at the Rio Summit. We will be lobbying for a clear road map for the SDGs and one that prioritizes women's representation, binding agreements on universal access to reproductive health and pledges to deliver those services. Ahead of the Rio summit, IPPF is making three positive commitments of its own to meet the sexual and reproductive health needs of people in the world's poorest countries to increase their resilience to climate change. More: Road to Rio special coverage . Firstly we will meet the needs of some 120 million women by increasing our provision of services for the poorest and most vulnerable people by 50%. Secondly, we will work towards making comprehensive sexuality education available to the world's largest ever generation of young people have by 2020. See also : 7 billion reasons to empower women . Finally we will lobby governments for legislative changes to ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive services by 2020. As climate change begins to influence our lives, it is the poorest women and children who again will pay the highest price. It is also women who can lead the changes required for increased resilience in the face of climate change and to enable them to do this we must meet their unmet need for health and education. We must now make up for lost time, investment and the opportunity. We need to hold governments and international agencies accountable for the commitments they have made -- financial, political and legal. This level of unmet need will expand as the world's largest generation ever of young people enter their reproductive lives - increasing demand for contraception by 40 per cent by 2050. This represents a crisis for health, human rights, and development. How can we hope for global sustainability and resilience unless we invest now in sexual and reproductive health and rights? The opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of Tewodros Melesse.","Across the world more than two in five pregnancies are unplanned .

ff138dc2ade0b14f5664cf02189195b6d7f64907,"A paedophile teacher filmed himself . abusing girls  in the classroom after school bosses failed over 14 . years  to act on 30 warnings about his behaviour. Nigel Leat, 51, was described by a judge as a ‘paedophile of the most sickening order’ when he was jailed indefinitely last year for abusing five girls, some as young as six. Yesterday a damning report showed that the primary school where he worked had catastrophically failed to protect the children in his care. Scroll down for video . Paedophile: Nigel Leat, a married father-of-two, breaks down during questioning by police . Over 14 years, concerns had been raised repeatedly about Leat’s behaviour with pupils, but his conduct was never investigated. He had abused children in the school’s computer room, resource room, staff room and even during lessons with other pupils present. Leat also regularly filmed the pupils’ harrowing ordeals using a camera provided by the school,  storing hundreds of films on more than 20 memory sticks labelled with his victims’ names. Staff at Hillside First School in Worle, Somerset, first noticed Leat selecting girls who were ‘less academically able, emotionally needy or pretty’ as his ‘favourites’ a year after he started teaching there in 1996. Sentence: Leat was given an indefinite jail term for his actions . His inappropriate behaviour was so well known that staff tried to prevent children likely to become his ‘star pupils’ from being put into his Year Two and Year Three classes. In 2004, a mother claimed Leat had been taking pictures of her daughter with a mobile phone but he denied the accusation and no action was taken. Four years later, two children told staff that Leat, a married father of two, had been touching their legs and kissing one of them – causing her to be sick – and a teacher twice reported him to the head. Another member of staff saw Leat projecting an indecent image of an adult on to a wall during a lesson. Leat was also seen lifting up and groping young girls in the playground, tickling and cuddling pupils in class and sitting on cushions with a schoolgirl while visibly aroused. But those staff members who reported Leat’s behaviour were told they should not ‘insinuate things’ and were bullied into silence, a report said yesterday. It was later discovered that Leat would routinely hide a camera under his desk and then summon his victims, recording the subsequent horrifying images of the abuse. In many of the videos, which are up to ten minutes in length, other children can be seen or heard in the background. When police finally became involved, Leat first denied wrongdoing but later admitted 36 sexual offences including rape, assault and voyeurism. Yesterday a review by the North Somerset Safeguarding Children Board concluded that his appalling crimes could have been stopped much earlier if the school had not failed to act on the warnings. Instead, out of 30 disturbing incidents noted, only 11 were mentioned to the school’s headmaster, Chris Hood, and none was passed on to an agency outside the school. Abuse: Leat worked at Hillside First School, in Weston-Super-Mare, where staff complained but were ignored . Leat was only arrested in December 2010, when a schoolgirl told her mother he abused her ‘every day apart from when the teaching assistant was in the classroom’. Police who raided the home he shared with his wife, also a teacher, found more than 30,000 images, including 61 pictures and 21 movies at level five, the most serious level.

Three Ofsted inspections undertaken during the time Leat was abusing his students graded it as ‘good’ and a report in 2009 noted: ‘Pupils feel exceptionally safe and secure because they know that staff have their well-being at heart.’ Tony Oliver, who chaired the  serious case review, said: ‘There was a failure at every level within the school. ‘There was a culture which just did not empower people to voice their concerns. It could be interpreted as a culture of bullying.’ He said the headmaster had  been sacked following a disciplinary process.","Nigel Leat was jailed indefinitely for abusing five girls - some as young as six .

Dr David Veale, a consultant psychiatrist in cognitive behaviour therapy at the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust told MailOnline: ‘Taking Selfies is not an addiction - it’s a symptom of Body Dysmorphic Disorder that involves checking one’s appearance.’ Selfie fans with BDD can spend hours trying to take pictures that do not show any defects or flaws in their appearance, which they are very aware of but which might be unnoticeable to others. Often, people who take selfies take several photographs until they find their best angle or pose, but picking out small details can make people very self-conscious about the tiniest of ‘flaws’. In one extreme case, a British teenager Danny Bowman tried to commit suicide because he was unsatisfied with his appearance in the selfies he took.","The LuMee was invented by 57-year-old photographer Allan Shoemake .

ff13c35ea62100a10e57cc8438bb7f30c8448cf0,"Ed Miliband wants to force energy firms to pass on fall wholesale prices . Energy firms should be forced by law to cut bills when the wholesale cost of oil and gas falls, Ed Miliband said yesterday. The Labour leader wants industry regulator Ofgem to have new powers to compel companies to pass on cost savings to households. He will stage a vote in Parliament on Wednesday for fast-track legislation to bring ‘immediate relief’ to families, echoing his high-profile call at his party’s conference in 2013 for a freeze on energy prices. It comes as a report last night found that wholesale prices are now the lowest in more than three years, but household bills are still not reflecting the fall. Despite Chancellor George Osborne’s investigation into the wholesale oil market, the Labour leader urged him to ‘put his money where his mouth is’ and make it mandatory for companies to allow consumers to benefit from falling costs. The idea will also be seen by Mr Miliband as a way to avoid flak over his price freeze bid – which could keep demands higher than they otherwise would be. Last night the Conservatives said Labour was to blame because energy firms were holding back in the expectation of a price freeze. Mr Miliband told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘We do want to see those reductions in wholesale costs passed on to consumers. ‘We see wholesale costs go down 20 per cent in gas prices over the last year and no reduction in bills.’ He added: ‘We can do that as well as having this freeze to make sure energy bills don’t rise.’ Mr Miliband also called for a new ‘living standards index’ to track how household finances are affected by changes to wages, prices, taxes and benefits. He also confirmed Labour would retain the annual cap on benefits claims – and would not rule out reducing it. In its latest report, energy analysis firm ICIS predicted that the low wholesale prices will continue for the rest of the year. Chancellor George Osborne (left) has already launched a Treasury investigation into whether energy companies are passing on the savings from falls in the wholesale price of oil - while Business Minister Matt Hancock said Labour's proposal to freeze energy bills would have kept price artificially high . Wholesale prices are now 11 per cent down year on year, according to its latest power price index, with wholesale gas down more than 20 per cent. Mark Todd, of price comparison service energyhelpline, said: ‘Wholesale gas prices have collapsed so it is time the suppliers passed price cuts on to their loyal customers.’ But Lawrence Slade of Energy UK, which represents electricity and gas suppliers, said prices were a commercial matter for companies who often buy months ahead, making it difficult to pass on savings quickly. ‘No new powers are needed,’ he said. ‘Energy suppliers are already passing on price cuts to customers.’ Business and energy minister Matthew Hancock said the threat of Labour’s price freeze is responsible for higher household bills now. ‘If that’s the case, they should abandon it immediately,’ he said. Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey said it would be ‘disastrous’ for consumers, with ‘yo-yo’ bills and competition killed off by extra regulation . Critics have already claimed Mr Miliband’s price freeze plan will send Britain back to the ‘bad old days’ of seventies power cuts by halting the investment needed to avoid blackouts and rationing. Last night a Tory source said: ‘Like most of his great ideas, Ed Miliband’s energy policy will take us back to the 1970s.’ Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary Ed Davey said it would be ‘disastrous’ for consumers, with ‘yo-yo’ bills and competition killed off by extra regulation. Mr Miliband also warned against political ‘deals and coalitions’ yesterday, following speculation that he could strike a pact with the SNP or Alex Salmond. However, he refused four times to categorically rule out a coalition, sparking claims he had ‘left the door open’ to Mr Salmond, who is standing for Westminster in the Scottish constituency of Gordon.","Ofgem to get powers to compel firms to pass on falls in oil and gas prices .

Ed Miliband's health policy was in chaos today after he took less than 24 hours to abandon his promise to protect the NHS from another costly reorganisation . Ed Miliband’s health policy was in chaos today after he took less than 24 hours to abandon his promise to protect the NHS from another costly reorganisation. The Labour leader went from warning yesterday that he would not reverse the coalition’s controversial Health and Social Care Act to promising to do just that. While Labour has extended its lead over the Tories for being trusted with the health service, the confusion will do little to persuade voters Mr Miliband is ready to take tough decisions in government. The NHS has to make £5billion every year in efficient savings by 2015 to make up for smaller rises in funding and growing demand from an ageing population. The Health and Social Care Act sparked the first big coalition split two years ago when then-Health Secretary Andrew Lansley unveiled the largest shake-up of the NHS in its 60 year history. Primary Care Trusts were abolished, with £60billion in health spending handed to groups run by GPs. After months of wrangling and re-writing, which saw several elements watered down and the role of private firms curtailed, it passed into law earlier this year. Mr Lansley was demoted at the reshuffled and replaced by Jeremy Hunt. Yesterday Mr Miliband said he could not promise to reverse the changes if he became Prime Minister. He told a Q&A in Manchester: ’I think what would be not sensible is for us to come along and say, “well, Andrew Lansley, now Jeremy Hunt, they’re changing all the arrangements, have these new clinical commissioning groups and so on, and we’re just going to reverse it all back and spend another £3bn on another top-down bureaucratic organisation""' But within hours Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, tweeted: ’I'll repeal the Bill. Full stop.’ Andy Burnham, shadow health secretary, said that he would repeal the bill . Aides then suggested the legislation could be repealed, but not all of the changes it introduced would be reversed. Today Mr Miliband appeared to admit that he got it wrong yesterday. He told BBC One’s the Andrew Marr Show: ’We will repeal their NHS bill. It puts the wrong principles back at the heart of the NHS, it puts the principles of competition, markets and money as the central defining principles of the NHS. ’We are going to repeal the bill, we are going to make those changes but of course we have to look at the detail of some of the reforms, some of the changes that have been made because I don't want to just shuffle the deckchairs all over the place again.’ Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb today said it would be 'madness' for Labour to repeal the Health and Social Care Act. 'From . my point of view, anyone who believes in the NHS and who wants to see a . sustainable NHS dealing with really challenging problems of an aging . population, should just be interested in making this work,' he told BBC . One's Sunday Politics. 'To . say repeal the act, effectively, is telling the NHS we're going to go . through another complete restructuring.

ff14085da0fbc0361fb6adda023718ab4f5084c6,"(CNN) -- For those who grew up in the '90s, ""Boy Meets World"" was definitive pop culture. From 1993-2000, the names Cory, Topanga, Shawn, Eric, and Feeny were synonymous with Friday night, and 14 years since Mr. Feeny uttered the words ""class dismissed"" on the series finale, nostalgia-addicts still miss the ABC sitcom. Now, the Disney Channel is hoping to reach a new crop of kids who will feel that same attachment, as the spin-off series ""Girl Meets World"" premieres June 27. Cory and Topanga are back, but don't expect the same couple we saw exiting the classroom all those years ago. They are surrounded by a new crew of comedic teens, and those behind the new series are hoping they've created a show that will please fans of the original, but also connect with a younger set looking for a program to call their own. CNN recently caught up with the cast and creator of ""Girl Meets World"" in Los Angeles and discovered a whole new world. The Matthews family of the original series has moved from Philadelphia to New York City in the new series -- which is in line with the series finale. On top of a new location, the teens of this modern sitcom are facing a different breed of angst-filled drama, chock full of social media insecurities. ""We're dealing with a lot of the same issues that we dealt with on the original series: themes of freedom from your parents and individuality and family support and relying on your friends,"" says Cory Matthews himself, Ben Savage. ""But it's in a lot more complicated framework because the world's a lot more complicated. Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Internet -- these are issues we didn't have to deal with in the '90s, which is shocking, but it was a totally different world."" ""Girls Meets World"" stars Rowan Blanchard as 12-year-old Riley Matthews, the older of Cory and Topanga's two kids. Riley is trying to find her place amid the pressures of family, friends and junior high. Savage returns as Cory, but now it's his turn to teach lessons. He's moved on from bumbling student to junior high school teacher, leading his own daughter's class. Topanga is now a full time lawyer and mother, remaining the voice of reason for the Matthews family -- though Danielle Fishel was nervous about stepping back into the character's shoes. ""I didn't know if it was going to be easy because it had been 14 years since I had done it consistently,"" Fishel says. ""But, literally, the second Ben and I were in a room together, I was Topanga and he was Cory and it was like no time had passed at all."" Still, Fishel was taken aback when she saw where the pair had ended up. ""I'm a little surprised that their oldest child is as old as she is, just because when they left for New York, Topanga was so focused on becoming a lawyer,"" the actress admits. ""I have a feeling it was Cory who was really ready to start a family and that was something they negotiated."" Savage and Fishel both confess they did not re-watch the series to get back into character, hoping to craft new versions of the pair we first met as seventh grade students. But the show's younger actors have each taken a crash course on the original series, despite the fact some of them were not born until after it wrapped. In fact, the teen stars view their characters as updated versions of the originals. Blanchard sees Riley as the Cory of the new show, while Sabrina Carpenter, who plays rebellious best friend Maya Hart, doesn't hide the fact her character is the Shawn. Riley's crush on new school transfer Lucas is noticeably similar to the dynamic of Cory and Topanga. But Carpenter is quick to point out this isn't the same show recycled. ""A lot has changed since the '90s,"" she says. ""Technology is insane and the way that people dress, the way that people talk to each other, the way that people don't talk to each other."" Michael Jacobs is the creative mind behind both series, and wasn't initially interested in rebooting the brand. It wasn't until he considered creating a set of characters for a new generation that Jacobs saw the value in a spin-off. He is well aware of the high expectations ""Boy Meets World"" fans have for the new series, and has taken to heart concerns this could mess up their childhood memories of the show. ""I don't want the new show to be compared in its pilot episode to an entire series,"" Jacobs says. ""The worst nightmare I have is that we've gotten all of this wonderful press and everyone is disappointed. I want the old audience to know if you stick with us, you will be extremely well rewarded with the growth of these characters."" For now, Cory and Topanga are the only returning characters, but that doesn't mean we won't see old friends over the course of the season. Rider Strong (Shawn Hunter) and William Daniels (Mr. Feeny) will reportedly both make appearances, and the writers promise nods to the old show. For Fishel, there is one aspect of ""Boy Meets World"" she hopes stays in the '90s -- the fashion. ""It's so nice to not have to worry about feathered bangs or chokers or oversized crop tops,"" the relieved actress says. ""We did a flashback scene and I had to wear lace and a choker, the crimped hair and the bangs. I'm like, 'Oh my gosh! I'm so glad I don't look like this anymore.'"" Jacobs is certain the relatable characters of the original series are what stood out for fans, and believes he and the writers have struck gold a second time around. ""The fact that the lead of the show was not 6-feet, sandy-haired, blue-eyed. The lead of the show was us! We want to do it real. I want a stumbling, gawky, unsure of herself child to grow up in front of us again. We did it once and we were successful.""","""Boy Meets World"" spinoff ""Girl Meets World"" makes its long-awaited debut .

ff142ac8603660376e21990a8885d761abe69605,"San Diego (CNN) -- President Obama's critics have the right to be upset by his decision to shield from deportation, at least temporarily, some groups of undocumented immigrants. But they don't have the right to twist the facts, use inflammatory language and create confusion. They're the ones who are most confused. They don't appear to have the foggiest idea how the process would work. That's their own fault. They should have paid closer attention two years ago, the last time the administration did something like this, with the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Simply put, Obama is using the executive power granted to him by the Constitution to reshuffle the immigration enforcement deck and prioritize deportations so that, for instance, the undocumented parents of U.S.-born citizens get a temporary ""deferred"" status and thus can't be removed for three years. But you should read the fine print. There are a lot of strings attached, and there is no guarantee that some of these people won't be deported. It's a crap shoot for undocumented immigrants, which explains why only a little over half of the young people who were eligible for DACA took the risk and applied for it, according to the Migration Policy Institute. No one can say what will happen when Obama's new deferment expires. A lot will depend on the political mood at the time, and what the new president will decide, in 2017, to do with immigrants who are holding these deferments. There could be extensions offered, or it could be the end of the road. If it's the latter, a large number of undocumented immigrants -- media reports have put the potential figure at 5 million, although the actual figure is likely to be much lower, given the response to DACA -- will be deportable once again. The administration has said that the new program -- which it is calling DAPA, Deferred Action for Parental Accountability -- would work much the same way as its predecessor, DACA. Obama announced that program in June 2012 and it took effect about six months later. Under DACA, undocumented young people brought here as children can apply for a two-year ""deferred action"" that lets them remain in the country temporarily without fear of being deported. Yet there is a catch -- when you deal with government, there's always a catch. I'll explain what it is in a minute. But first, let's listen to what has been coming from the sky-is-falling chorus in the Republican Party. Obama's conservative critics really do say the darnedest things. A recurring theme is that Obama is acting outside the law, rewriting the law or ignoring the law. When I asked one conservative commentator to explain, he said: ""Well, there was a law on the books that said a person can't be in the country illegally? Now they can. Because Obama changed it."" Nonsense. He did no such thing. Obama merely applied to the enforcement of immigration laws something that all police, prosecutors and judges have: discretion. Now it turns out I have to explain this simple concept to Obama himself. This week, the President responded to hecklers at a speech in Chicago who were demanding that he ease up on deportations by insisting that he had just taken action to ""change"" the law. Meanwhile, law professors and other legal experts have come forward to say that Obama did not, in fact, change the law and that he has the Constitution on his side when it comes to using executive power. Conservative critics are wrong that he went so far as to ""change"" the law, and Obama was wrong to agree with them. Other critics went even further and suggested that Obama wasn't just changing the law but actually ""canceling"" it. More nonsense. No president can cancel a law, or repeal a law, or strike down a law. Only Congress can do that. But this brings us back to the ""catch"" in Obama's executive action. Those of us who have interviewed DACA recipients and studied how that program works will find it difficult to take seriously the concerns raised by critics who are unfamiliar with the subject matter. You see, while the administration hasn't yet released the procedures for applying for DAPA, White House officials have said that the new program will be modeled on DACA. This means that qualifying for this temporary reprieve from deportation won't be a walk in the park. Here's what happens under DACA: The first thing that an undocumented immigrant must do is contact the friendly neighborhood office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and declare that he or she is in the country illegally. Immigrants who do that are then subjected to background checks and fingerprinted. Files are created with their names on them, where the government will keep their home addresses, the names of their employers, if any, the names of everyone else who lives in their houses, etc. Then each application is considered by USCIS officials, and either approved or denied. If the application is approved, under DACA the immigrant could remain in the United States for three years -- unless the policy is rescinded by a future president. If it is denied, there is no appeal and the government has all of the immigrant's personal information. So much for staying in the shadows. So tell me again how Obama is ""canceling"" existing immigration law. If that is the case, then how it is that the whole process for obtaining deferred action for DACA -- and likely for DAPA too -- begins with undocumented immigrants, in essence, surrendering to authorities? If immigration law is really no longer in effect, why do these people have to bother turning themselves in at all, getting fingerprinted and all the rest? Also, if immigration law is really being repealed, then under what authority will immigration agents be deciding the fate of DAPA applicants? In fact, if the immigration law is canceled, wouldn't these agents be out of a job? After all, once you strike down a law, it's difficult to enforce it. You think all this makes for a sweet deal for the undocumented? Not exactly the free ride that Obama's critics think it is -- that is, if they were thinking at all.","Navarrette: Critics can disagree with Obama immigration action, but should get facts right .

ff14bca1a9ecd94621ba428668d33f7de109efed,"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Tam Chi Tat has driven his bright red taxi for 20 years. Born and raised in Hong Kong, he calls himself not Chinese but a ""Hong Konger."" The distinction is very important to him. ""The difference between Hong Kong and the mainland is that we grew up in a relatively free environment,"" he says. Relative freedom rings in this metropolis on the southern tip of China. There's freedom of assembly, freedom of the press and rule of law. Since the handover from Britain to China 17 years ago, the people of Hong Kong were granted a wide range of civil liberties and a measure of autonomy under the governing principle known as ""one country, two systems."" But many say that way of life is now under threat as Beijing affirms its ""comprehensive jurisdiction"" over Hong Kong in a white paper issued by the State Council Information Office. Many in Hong Kong consider the white paper an abrupt missive from Beijing declaring that they call the shots. Political muscles . Albert Ho is a member of Hong Kong's Legislative Council and organizer of Occupy Central -- a movement of pro-democracy activists who have threatened to ""occupy"" the central business district if their calls are not heard. He tells me this is the message from Beijing: Hong Kong is subordinate to the central government. ""And when the time comes -- if it's necessary and appropriate -- all the powers previously given, dedicated and authorized to Hong Kong, could be taken back,"" Ho adds. China's political muscle flexing comes at a politically sensitive time for the territory, as scores of Hong Kongers demand true universal suffrage to elect their leader. The National People's Congress has said that the election of Hong Kong's top leader may be implemented by universal suffrage in 2017. But will it happen without Beijing effectively screening the candidates? As a hint of what will happen in 2017, Michael DeGolyer, professor and director of the Hong Kong Transition Project, points to how patriotism is emphasized in the white paper. ""Clearly they are saying that (patriotism) is the fundamental requirement,"" DeGolyer says. ""And we have to be assured whoever is being nominated to run is patriotic, according to our definition, i.e. willing to follow orders."" Standing ground . On July 1st in Hong Kong, tens of thousands of protesters -- if not more -- demonstrated for a free and open system to elect their government. After the march, more than 500 protesters were arrested at an illegal sit-in -- including Albert Ho. Prior to his arrest, the pro-democracy lawmaker told me he was willing to go to jail to expand democracy in Hong Kong ""because we have to make it absolutely clear to Beijing that they have to honor their promises given to the Hong Kong people."" But is civil disobedience the only way forward? Douglas Young is Hong Kong-born designer and co-founder of Goods of Desire, a retail business and lifestyle brand that draws inspiration from local icons from old mailboxes to mooncakes. Over the years, Young has courted controversy -- and the attention of Hong Kong police -- with a few eyebrow-raising designs. And yet the rebel designer believes persuasion -- not protest -- should shape the future of Hong Kong. Young addresses Albert Ho point blank: ""I think you are going to create more enemies than supporters."" ""At the end of the day, especially in an Asian society, I don't think people react well with aggression. It's soft power, it's persuasion, that can appeal to them."" True freedom . Like many other business owners in Hong Kong, Young believes demonstrations should take a backseat to dialogue with China to bring about more opportunity. ""We should integrate with China,"" Young says. ""Kids will be able to build their homes and businesses because what we suffer from is the lack of space in Hong Kong."" ""If we can embrace Guangzhou, Shanghai, Dongguan and Macau, Hong Kong will be a great metropolis."" But, as Albert Ho points out, such opportunity requires both sound infrastructure and sound governance. ""We need good government,"" Ho tells me emphatically. ""And that must be based on a truly democratic government."" Hong Kong taxi driver Tam Chi Tat wants his vote to truly count one day. ""I definitely want universal suffrage,"" he says. ""So that we can have a leader who is not as corrupt as mainland officials."" It's the aspiration of a people raised on freedom. But true universal suffrage anywhere on Chinese soil is not something Beijing will easily grant.","Hong Kong governed by China under ""one country, two systems"" model allows the territory more freedoms than the rest of the country .
The election of Hong Kong's top leader may be by universal suffrage in 2017 .

A mother has hit out at school teachers for excluding her teenage son from classes over his Wayne Rooney-style haircut. Billy Davies was told his hairstyle was too ‘extreme’ for the classroom because it is shaved into a ‘V’ shape at the back - similar to one previously sported by the Manchester United striker. Teachers at Park Community School in Havant, Hampshire, decided to bar the 15-year-old from all of his lessons until his hair grows back. 'Extreme': Billy Davies' hairstyle was branded 'extreme' by teachers and he was told he could not join lessons because it breached uniform policy at Park Community School in, Havant . But furious Jackie Davies said: ‘The school is being pedantic. His hair isn’t extreme at all. ‘I could understand if he was going to school with purple or blue hair but that’s not the case.’ The teen, who lives with his parents in Havant, said: ‘It’s stupid because I don’t think there’s anything wrong with my hair. ‘It’s fashionable and a lot of my friends have the same sort of haircut, yet I’m the only one who has been punished. ‘Some of the students even have pink hair. Style icons: Haircuts, like the ones sported by Chelsea's Raul Meireles, left, and Manchester United's Wayne Rooney, have been banned by the school . ‘I . feel gutted because now I’m not in lessons with my friends and it’s . going to be harder to concentrate on my work being sat alone.’ The youngster now has to do his work in a room by himself during lesson time. If he needs any help then he has to go and ask a teacher before returning to the room once he has had assistance. The schoolboy has had the haircut for a . year but letters were sent out by the school in September which warned . parents it would not tolerate ‘extreme’ hairstyles. Billy says he never got a copy of the letter and argues that his hairstyle is not ‘extreme’. Excluded: Billy Davies does not see any problem with his hairstyle but has been banned him from lessons until it grows out . Last year, parents began a campaign to get regulations relaxed at the school after scores of pupils were banned from lessons. They felt their children were being punished for spiking up their hair with gel and having it subtly coloured. Headteacher Chris Anders said: ‘We’re an outstanding school and proud of our high standards. ‘Parents are well aware of the uniform policy and support it. ‘It’s . always a shame when students do not follow rules. But as adults working . with children and young people, we know it is important to be clear . about the consequences of actions and to follow through when rules are . broken.’","Billy Davies, 15, has to do work in room by himself until hair grows back .

The former public face of the discredited Legion of Christ order who left the priesthood after fathering a love child is getting married this weekend to his son’s mother. Former clergyman Thomas Williams will walk down the aisle with the daughter of former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See Mary Ann Glendon - one of Pope Francis' top advisers. Glendon, a Harvard University law professor, is one of the highest-ranking women at the Vatican as president of the Pontifical Academy for Social Sciences. She is also one of five people on Francis’ commission to reform the scandal-marred Vatican bank. Her daughter, Elizabeth Lev, is a well-regarded art historian and columnist for the Legion-run Zenit news agency, which Williams published for over a decade while he was in the order. Williams, a moral theologian, author, lecturer and U.S. television personality, admitted last year that he had fathered a child several years earlier. At the time, Williams apologized for ‘this grave transgression’ against his vows of celibacy and said he had stayed on as a priest because he hoped to move beyond ‘this sin in my past’ to do good work for the church. Happy couple: Williams (left) resigned the priesthood last year after admitting the he fathered a son several years ago with art historian Elizabeth Lev, pictured right with the boy . Friends in high places: Lev is the daughter of former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See Mary Ann Glendon, pictured here in 2008 with then-Pope Benedict XVI . The Legion’s retired superior later admitted he had learned about the child in 2005 but allowed Williams to keep teaching and preaching about morality. After taking a year off for reflection, Williams left the priesthood in May to care for his son, who suffers from Down syndrome. According to their wedding registry, he and Lev are due to marry Saturday in the U.S. Trailblazer: Glendon (left), pictured in Rome with her daughter, is currently one of the highest-ranking women at the Vatican as president of the Pontifical Academy for Social Sciences . Lev is an American-born art historian who has lived and worked in Rome since 1997. She has two other children from past relationships. She had initially denied an affair with Williams, though they frequently were seen together in American expatriate circles in Rome, particularly with visiting U.S. student and Catholic tour groups. The couple's wedding announcement coincides with a revelation made by the Legion, which admitted Thursday that a superior who was in charge of the bulk of its American priests-in-training for over a decade sexually abused a minor at the Legion’s novitiate in Cheshire, Connecticut. The Legion said a second accuser had also come forward with an allegation against the Rev. William Izquierdo, who was novice director at the Cheshire school from 1982-1994 and in Ireland before then. Izquierdo, now 85, has dementia. The Rev. Marcial Maciel founded the cult-like Legion in 1941 in Mexico and oversaw its growth into a large and prominent congregation despite credible reports that he was a drug addict and child molester. After Maciel’s death in 2008, the Legion admitted that he fathered three children and sexually abused his seminarians. In 2010, the Vatican took over the . order and a papal delegate has been overseeing a reform and . ‘purification.’ In January, the Legion will elect a new leadership and . approve a new set of constitutions. The . Legion scandal has been particularly damaging to the Vatican because . Maciel was held up by Pope John Paul II and his cardinals as a model for . the faithful, with the order admired for its orthodoxy and ability to . bring in money and new priests. Like . all Legion priests, Williams had been a staunch defender of Maciel. When Maciel’s double life became public in 2009, Williams told the . Catholic ETWN program that the revelations were a ‘very, very hard blow . to all of us.’ Until he . left active ministry, Williams was the most publicly prominent priest in . the 950-strong order. He is the author of such books as 2008’s ‘Knowing . Right From Wrong: A Christian Guide to Conscience,’ and was a . commentator for the U.S. broadcaster CBS. Matriarch: Lev has two older daughters and a young son fathered by Williams, who suffers from Down syndrome . In good company: Lev, center, is pictured with director Ron Howard (right) and his film crew during the shooting of 'Angels and Demons' in Rome . He was the superior of the Legion’s general directorate in Rome in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The Legion’s revelation about a senior cleric having abused a novitiate was contained in a report on the steps the Legion has taken to address sexually abusive clergy within its ranks and respond to the victims of Maciel. According to the report by the Legion’s superior, the Rev. Sylvester Heerman, 35 priests have been accused of sexually abusing minors; nine were found guilty and 14 were acquitted in a church trial. Two had left the priesthood when the allegations were made, so no church sanctions could be imposed, and 10 cases are still under review. In addition, two Legion superiors were found guilty of sexually abusing adults under their case and three were acquitted. The Legion said the numbers indicate that less than 1 per cent of the 1,133 priests ordained in the 72-year history of the order had been found guilty by a church trial of abuse, and less than 4 per cent had been abused.","Thomas Williams was the public face of Legion of Christ religious order until his resignation last year .

Scientists found a specific bacterial family passed down form generation to generation was more common in the guts of lean individuals. Lab tests showed a strain of that bacteria prevented people gaining weight when it was transplanted in mice. Genetics influence whether we are fat or thin by shaping which types of microbes thrive in our body, the study found. Obese and overweight people could be prescribed a fat-busting probiotic bacteria to stop them gain weight, a new study has revealed . The breakthrough could lead to personalised probiotic therapies to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases on an individual's genetic make-up. Associate Professor Ruth Ley at the Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics of Cornell University said: 'Up until now, variation in the abundances of gut microbes has been explained by diet, the environment, lifestyle, and health. 'This is the first study to firmly establish that certain types of gut microbes are heritable - that their variation across a population is in part due to host genotype variation, not just environmental influences.' Both genetic variation and the composition of gut microbes have previously been linked to diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, putting sufferers at greater risk of heart disease, stroke and other conditions affecting blood vessels. Despite these common links. the relationship between genetic variation and the diversity of gut microbes has been difficult to establish. Past studies of twins failed to reveal an effect of genetic variation on the diversity of gut microbes. The Cornell University researchers suspected past studies included too few pairs of twins. As a result they sequenced the genes of microbes found in stool samples from 416 pairs of twins. They found an abundance of specific types of microbes were more similar in identical twins, who are genetically the same, than in non-identical pairs no more similar than ordinary siblings, other than sharing environmental influences in the womb. The findings demonstrated that human genes influence the composition of gut microbes. The breakthrough could lead to personalised probiotic therapies to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases on an individual's genetic make-up, the team at Cornell University believe. File picture . The type of bacteria whose abundance was most heavily influenced by human genetics was a recently identified family called christensenellaceae. Members of the health-promoting bacterial family were more abundant in lean individuals, than those who were obese. Mice that were then treated with this specific bacteria strain gained less weight than those that were not treated with the microbes. The team believe their findings could pave the way for a microbe that prevents obesity in humans. Prof Ley said: 'Our results showing that bacterial abundances run in families may be useful for disease risk prediction. 'The microbiome is also an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation. By understanding the nature of our association with these health-associated bacteria, we could eventually exploit them to promote health.' The study was published in the journal Cell.","Scientists at Cornell University found a specific bacterial family that was more common in the guts of lean individuals .

Pressure to secure a better deal for pensioners facing crippling care home costs intensified yesterday. Former minister Stephen Dorrell said a plan to offer loans to pay for care was not delivering ‘the objective the Government set out’. Mr Dorrell, chairman of the Commons health select committee, particularly questioned a proposal to limit loans to people with assets of less than £23,000. Former minister Stephen Dorrell said a plan to offer loans to pay for care was not delivering 'the objective the Government set out' In July, the Coalition promised that the loans scheme would prevent anyone from having to meet the cost of care while they were alive. In a second attack on the scheme yesterday, Lord Lipsey suggested that pensioners taking up the loans could be forced to repay thousands of pounds if they inadvertently failed to disclose all their assets. He urged ministers to change a ‘nasty’ part of the new legislation that could penalise elderly people who make an honest mistake in applying for the loans from their council. ‘As the Bill is now drafted, if you make a mistake the local authority can pursue you for all the money and even sell your house if you make a mistake,’ he said. ‘Fraud should be pursued, but not an old lady who has just made a mistake. It is a very nasty clause.’ Promise: Care minister Norman Lamb and Daily Mail headlines from yesterday, top, and 2012, bottom . Lord Lipsey’s attack came as Downing . Street signalled a change of heart over plans to deny middle-class . pensioners access to the deferred-payment scheme, under which . Government-backed loans would cover home help hire and care home fees, . and would be repaid from the person’s estate. Lord Warner, a member of the independent Dilnot Commission that drew up plans to cap care costs, said of the Government: ‘I think they’ve been a bit sneaky.’ Lord Lipsey has praised the Daily Mail for its ‘sustained and splendid’ campaign against crippling care home costs that force people to sell their homes. The peer said the paper had made a real difference by bringing the scandal to the public’s attention. On Monday night, he exposed the Government’s plans to restrict access to a deferred-payment scheme to those with assets of less than around £23,000. During his speech in the House of Lords, he also mentioned his admiration for the Daily Mail, which has long highlighted the effects of sky-high care fees. Three years ago, we revealed at least 20,000 people a year have to sell up to pay their care costs, denying their children an inheritance. Yesterday, he told the Mail: ‘I praise the Daily Mail for its campaign on people having to sell their houses to pay for care. ‘We owe the Government’s original proposals to impose a cap on care costs very much to the Mail’s sustained and splendid campaign. I’m sure the Mail will continue to campaign until the Government changes its position.’ David Lipsey, a former political editor of the Economist and Labour policy adviser, was created a life peer in 1999. However, Mr Cameron’s spokesman said: ‘£23,000 is the starting point because that is the means-test threshold. For those who have assets that are separate from their home, what is the level above which they should make some contribution? We are consulting on that.’ Care Minister Norman Lamb said: ‘No decisions have been taken. We’re listening carefully to all consultation responses and take seriously the concerns raised.’ However, he also suggested that anyone excluded had a ‘vast amount of money in the bank’. Last night, Lord Lipsey, the Labour peer and former member of the 1990s Royal Commission on elderly care, welcomed the apparent shift by the Government. He said: ‘It would be good if they raised the threshold substantially, but it would be best if they dropped it all together.’ The charity Age UK shared his concern about councils being given the power to sell an applicant’s house if a mistake was made in declaring assets, saying that it could deter pensioners from applying. However, a Tory health spokesman said local authorities already had such powers but only used them as a last resort. Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser on older people’s care, said: ‘People with £23,000 in the bank, that they have saved up all their lives, do not have “significant means”. Everything in the Dilnot proposals is being watered down and I kind of wonder what these reforms are going to achieve.’ A Downing Street source said: ‘The idea that anyone will have to sell their homes to pay for social care is simply scaremongering. ‘The Government is spending £1billion a year in order to ensure people can keep their homes, deal with the crisis left by the Labour Party, and help provide dignity for all in old age.’","Former minister Stephen Dorrell said plan was not delivering 'the objective the government set out'

ff18601978b269baef349e569bc2406aeddced71,"A champagne cork-like device that nurtures fledgling embryos inside a woman’s body could halve the cost of IVF, doctors believe. This would give many more women the chances of fulfilling their dream of motherhood. The clear plastic mini-incubator would also make IVF quicker, easier and more natural, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s annual conference in Honolulu heard. In a pilot study, women treated using the INVOcell device were just as likely to become pregnant as others. Nine babies have been born so far. Scroll down for video . A new champagne cork-like device could halve the cost of in vitro fertilisation (IVF), doctors claim. Pictured is the artificial insemination of a human female egg during the IVF process . Almost half of the 50,000 women who have IVF in Britain each year pay for it themselves. But with clinics charging up to £15,000 a session, some simply cannot afford it. The new technique aims to cut costs by simplifying the process. Researcher Dr Kevin Doody said: ‘The cost of IVF is tremendously prohibitive. ‘We are trying to simplify the whole process – what we like to call effortless IVF.’ In a conventional IVF lab, fledgling embryos are kept in expensive incubators for up to five days before the best ones are put into the woman’s body. This is costly. The incubators cost tens of thousands of pounds each and have to be constantly monitored to make sure they are working properly, are at the right temperature and contain the right mix of gases for the delicate embryos to grow. The INVOcell technique lowers costs by doing away with the incubators and the need for constant monitoring. The early-stage embryos are instead nurtured inside a clear plastic device of roughly the same size and shape as a champagne bottle cork. This is placed inside the woman’s vagina, which is at the right temperature and contains the right mix of carbon dioxide and oxygen for growth. Nine babies have so far been born using the new, cheaper, IVF technique. File image used . After three to five days, it is removed and the best embryos transferred to the woman’s womb as usual. Costs are also cut by giving lower doses of the powerful drugs used to boost egg production ahead of IVF. Lower doses also mean that a woman needs to make fewer visits to the IVF clinic to check the drugs are working properly. So rather than taking time off work for ten trips to her doctor, she only needs three appointments. In a study of 33 infertile women, pregnancy rates were the same among those who used INVOcell as those whose embryos were nurtured in incubators. Dr Doody, of the Center for Assisted Reproduction in Bedford, Texas, said: ‘We are amazed that we could grow beautiful, top-quality embryos without the complexity of an incubator.’ His wife, Dr Kathleen Doody, said: ‘We definitely had feedback from patients that it seemed more natural to them.’ It is hoped that by simplifying the process, it will be possible to provide IVF from mobile units, making it more accessible for those who don’t live in big towns and cities. Dr Doody, who has shares in the device’s manufacturer, Massachusetts-based INVO Bioscience, said that while it won’t be suitable for all women, it could help up to two-thirds of patients. The device may also make IVF more acceptable to the Catholic Church, which disapproves of IVF because fertilisation takes place outside the body and in a dish. With INVOcell, fertilisation takes place once the device is inside the woman’s body. INVO Bioscience hopes to have the device on sale in the US by the end of this year. It is seeking a partner for a European launch. British doctors raised safety concerns, including the potential for infection. Professor Simon Fishel, managing director of the CARE Fertility group of clinics, cautioned that it will be impossible to check the embryos for defects when they are hidden away in the device. He added that it will ‘offer options for some’. Dr Geeta Nargund, medical director of the Create fertility clinic in London’s Harley Street, said: ‘I welcome any development with the potential to reduce the cost of IVF. ‘We need to do more research to assess the impact on cost reduction and success of the method.’","Doctors believe the new technique could halve the cost of IVF treatment .

'I try to do the right thing and I get this.' Mr Noicos said he had not had any disagreements with his former friend of almost 20 years on the day of the incident. 'Everything was fine, in fact he drove me to the doctor in the morning and said ring me when you finish up and I'll come pick you up,' he said. 'I kept ringing and there was no answer, so I got a taxi home and had to face police, ambulances and fire brigades putting out my house.' Afterwards his insurance company NRMA Insurance put him up in an apartment in the city but two weeks ago they rejected his claim. 'Their reason being that I gave him permission to be in the house', Mr Noicos said, and the man allegedly lit it deliberately. 'But I'm like, I didn't give him permission to light the fire! 'It's been a very bad experience for me… I'm trying to appeal the decision because I don't think it's fair.' The Block's auctioneer Damien Cooley has signed on to draw more interest to the property, after he heard the 'sad story' and wanted to help . Real estate agent Santos Sulfaro said since Richardson & Wrench Leichhardt posted the property ad at midday on Monday his phone had been ringing off the hook . Police said a 55-year-old man is due to appear in Central Local Court on December 1, charged with contravening an apprehended violence order and damaging a property by fire. Mr Noicos can't afford to stay in the apartment, or pay to fix the damage to his St Peters home, so he has decided to sell. Real estate agency Richardson & Wrench Leichhardt are enlisting Damien Cooley from The Block to conduct the auction on November 22 in order to draw more interest. Mr Cooley said it was a sad story and he wanted to help Mr Noicos get a good result. 'You don't like these things come to people, and it's by no fault of his own, so I thought it was a good thing to be involved in,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Cooley said he had been involved in the sale of derelict and damaged homes in the past but this was that worst one he'd seen 'for quite some time'. Te house features a mix of old and new features, including a renovated kitchen, bathroom and laundry . Mr Sulfaro said the fire damage was contained to the front four metres of the home, but the rest of the house was covered in soot . 'In some respects it looks a lot worse than it really is,' he said. 'The smoke damage gives it the feeling that the whole house is in wrack and ruin.' Real estate agent Santos Sulfaro said since Richardson & Wrench posted the property ad at midday on Monday his phone had been ringing off the hook. 'It's had quite a lot of interest from people curious about the price range and what the possibilities are,' Mr Sulfaro told Daily Mail Australia. 'We're looking at above $650,000, but prior to the fire it easily would have achieved $950,000.' Mr Sulfaro said the fire damage was contained to the front four metres of the home. 'If it was someone from a building background they could fix it up easily for $80-$100,000,' he said. 'For someone else with no building background it could cost up to $150,000, but still even at that price there's a lot of hard work involved that's not going to cost you a lot of money. Mr Sulfaro said the air-conditioning ducts and electrical wiring would also need to be replaced . The house also has its original timber floors and high metal press ornate ceilings . 'Most of the house is covered in smoke soot and that might just take a few weekends there with a bit of elbow grease to get rid of.' Mr Sulfaro said the air-conditioning ducts and electrical wiring would also need to be replaced. He added that the house featured a mix of old and new features, including a renovated kitchen, bathroom and laundry, original timber floors and high metal press ornate ceilings. Mr Sulfaro said under normal circumstances in St Peters $650,000 would get a homebuyer a modern one-bedroom apartment with a car space. 'I think this is probably the cheapest property on the market in the Inner West,' he said. 'I don't think you can get better value and I haven't seen better value all year.' Prior to the fire the house  would have easily sold for $950,000, the real estate agent said . Mr Sulfaro said under normal circumstances in St Peters $650,000 would get a homebuyer a modern one-bedroom apartment with a car space . An NRMA Insurance spokeswoman said in a statement: 'Mr. Noicos' home was damaged by a fire that was determined by Police to have been deliberately lit by Mr. Noicos' housemate. 'Because the fire was lit by a person authorised by Mr. Noicos to live in his home, his claim was declined in accordance with a general exclusion in his policy, listed in the product disclosure statement.' NRMA said it  reviewed his claim and maintained its decision to decline it. 'We have provided him with a further option for the matter to be escalated,' the spokeswoman said. 'Alternatively, he can take the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service, or seek legal advice.' NRMA added that it doesn't cover any intentional act or omission by 'you, your family or someone who lives in your home — for example, the tenants' or 'someone who acts with your or your family's consent, or the consent of someone who lives in your home'.","Tom Noicos, 54, is being forced to sell his home in St Peters in Sydney .

Hilary Mantel booked a place in history by becoming the first author to win both the Costa Book Award and the Man Booker Prize in a year . Hilary Mantel made literary history last night by becoming the first author to win both the Costa Book Award and the Man Booker Prize within a year. The author picked up the £30,000 Costa Book Award for her novel Bring Up The Bodies - three months after winning the Man Booker prize with it. The book is the second in a planned trilogy about the turbulent life and relationships of King Henry VIII’s advisor Thomas Cromwell. The first book in the trilogy, Wolf Hall, was awarded the Man Booker in 2009, making Miss Mantel, 60, the first UK author to win the Booker Prize twice. Last night chair of the judges, Radio 4 presenter Jenni Murray, said the panel had been unanimous in its decision to select Bring Up The Bodies from the shortlist of five books. She insisted Mantel’s previous success had not affected the decision, but that it was ‘simply the best book’. ‘One book stood out on head and shoulders - more than head and shoulders, on stilts above the rest and that was Hilary Mantel,’ she said. She praised the author’s writing style, saying her words were ‘poetry’. ‘It is so poetic, so beautiful, it is set in its time but it is also incredibly modern,’ she added. Dame Jenni said she had read every book on the shortlist on both her Kindle and in published form and that old-fashioned books were full of ‘pleasures’ missing from new technology. Other books on the shortlist included a comic-style graphic memoir about James Joyce’s daughter, Dotter of her Father’s Eyes, by husband and wife team Mary and Bryan Talbot, and children’s book Maggot Moon by dyslexic writer Sally Gardner.

Cruelty was allowed to become 'normal' in the NHS at the time of the Stafford hospital scandal and neither staff nor ministers took any notice, Jeremy Hunt said yesterday. The Health Secretary promised to overhaul hospitals so they provide the 'safest, most compassionate and most effective' care in the world. He made a string of formal recommendations to drive up standards in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which hundreds of patients died needlessly and staff were said to have become 'immune' to the sound of pain. Named: Every patient will have the name of the doctor and nurse responsible for their care written above their bed, as part of measures to hold NHS staff to account . They include: . * Fines for hospitals if they try to cover up mistakes . * Every patient to have an allocated nurse and doctor, with the names posted above their beds . * Hospitals to publish the number of nurses working on each ward . * Doctors and nurses to be suspended or even struck off for not owning up to mistakes . * Doctors and nurses to face up to five years in jail if they wilfully neglect patients . * Failed managers to be blacklisted and barred from getting other jobs in the NHS. * Hospitals to put up 'how to complain' guides in wards. Up . to 1,200 patients are feared to have died needlessly at Mid . Staffordshire NHS Trust between 2005 and 2009, yet a damning inquiry by . Sir Robert Francis, QC, at the beginning of this year warned it could . happen again. The Government . has since been drawing up a series of recommendations to improve care . across the health service and prevent staff from trying to cover up . their mistakes. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (left) said that cruelty had become the norm in the NHS, and he warned it must never happen again while Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said the government's words had to be followed by action . Outlining his response to the Francis . report in the Commons yesterday, Mr Hunt said: 'Cruelty became normal in . our NHS and no-one noticed. The inquiry shows the devastating effects . of overly defensive responses – hurting families, suppressing the truth . and preventing lessons being learned. 'The . NHS is a moral being or it is nothing. I do not simply want to prevent . another Mid Staffs, I want our NHS to be a beacon across the world, not . just for equity but its excellence. 'I want it to offer the safest, most compassionate and most effective care available anywhere and I believe it can.' The . proposals include fining  hospitals if they try to cover up  mistakes . which cause harm or death. Trusts could be made to pay out tens of . thousands of pounds to the NHS for the most serious errors. Every patients will also be given the name of a nurse and a consultant who is in charge of their care. Hospitals . will have to publish the number of nurses working on each ward and be . expected to put up 'how to complain' guides, with step-by-step . instructions for what patients and families should do if they are . unhappy. Mr Hunt told MPs patients needed to have confidence in the care they would receive from the NHS . The Francis Inquiry into the scandal at Mid Staffordshire heard hundreds of patients died there from 2005 to 2009 . They will also have . to publish  figures on the number of complaints every three months, . with details of what lessons have been learnt from each one. Staff . who do not immediately  own up to errors would face  tougher sanctions . than those who are honest, under proposals. NHS officials are liaising . with watchdogs to see whether honesty could be taken into account in . punishments. But Julie . Bailey, whose mother Bella died at Stafford Hospital, said she was . 'disappointed' that Mr Hunt's proposals did not go far enough. She and . other campaigners wanted new laws protecting whistleblowers from the . sack and a legal obligation for staff to be  honest with patients. Meanwhile, . former Labour health spokesman Diane Abbott admitted her party had made . it more important for nurses to take exams than to care. She . said: 'For many members of the public, one of the problems with general . standards of care may have been the push under a Labour government for . an all-graduate nursing profession. And there is a view that what that . has led to is elevating taking exams over and above basic levels of . care.' Alone: Dorothy Simpson, who died at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital . A hospital has apologised after a dying 84-year-old woman was forced to make a desperate call to her family after being abandoned by staff. Dorothy Simpson died 'frightened and alone' in a ward which resembled a 'ghost town' after doctors and nurses at Royal Bournemouth Hospital failed to come to her aid. The great-grandmother used her mobile to call son Steve as she struggled to breathe, without a single member of staff on the ward to help her. Her eldest son Jim rushed to the hospital, arriving 20 minutes later, but found that she had died alone with the bedside monitor alarm still sounding. Steve Simpson, 63, said the family were 'angry and devastated' at the appalling treatment of their mother. He said: 'She died alone and frightened because of the hospital's countless failings. If my mother had been given the care she deserved she would still be here today.' The retired decorator described the ward as a 'ghost town' and said Mrs Simpson, who suffered from a terminal lung disease, was left for a further four hours before a doctor arrived. The hospital has now admitted to a catalogue of shocking blunders in relation to the death on July 27 and apologised, following an internal inquiry.","Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt reveals plans to prevent repeat of Mid-Staffs .

ff1947cd9770da36c7196ba456961f4be2221e18,"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- NATO's North Atlantic Council on Sunday approved an operations plan that will shift the entire Libyan military mission to alliance command, officials said, easing the burden on the United States and its allies to protect civilians in the war-torn country. NATO ambassadors unanimously approved a so-called ""no-fly plus"" plan that will put the alliance in charge of protecting civilians as well as enforcing a no-fly zone and an arms embargo. ""Our goal is to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas under threat of attack from the Gadhafi regime,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said. ""NATO will implement all aspects of the U.N. resolution. Nothing more, nothing less."" The new NATO mandate will begin in two to three days, NATO officials said, allowing the current coalition, led by the United States, the United Kingdom and France, to stand down. At the same time, NATO was putting the final touches on its takeover of the no-fly zone over Libya. The handover from the United States and allies should be complete by Monday. NATO officials described the transition as a phased and seamless operation. All alliance members will have to abide by the rules of engagement approved Sunday, albeit with caveats that may allow some nations not to participate in operations in Libya. However, it is assumed that none of these nations will prevent other alliance members from executing the military plan and rules of engagement that were approved. A senior U.S. administration official spoke to reporters soon after the announcement. He stressed the NATO mission is to protect civilians and did not rule out the possibility of an attack on the rebels if they were to go on the offensive and strike cities with civilian populations, now held by pro-Gadhafi forces. The official also said he expected more countries to participate in the Libyan mission now that NATO has assumed command of it. He praised the speed with which the group of 28 allies reached a consensus. The office of British Prime Minister David Cameron similarly cheered the news of a NATO agreement. ""NATO is already enforcing the arms embargo and the no-fly zone. Today's agreement to transfer complete command and control of all military operations to NATO both ensures that partners from the region are able to participate and represents a significant step forward as we plan for the next phase of this vital mission,"" it read.","NATO agrees to take on all Libya operations .

Karen Chamberlain, 52, from Dover splashed out on a glamorous bash for her female bulldog, Lady Lola, to mark the fact she had survived to 10 years old despite being given just five years to live after a devastating house fire in 2005. The professional dog breeder, who specialises in bulldogs, hired a lavish beach club where Lola sat upon a specially-made throne and dressed in a £150 dress and £100 tiara. Lola gets ready for the party with the help of besotted owner Karen, 52, who spent £5,000 on it . The pair were joined by dozens of doggy friends who tucked into a 10-tier cake and enjoyed live entertainment. Karen, who has no children, said: 'People think I'm mad - I've been called ""barking"" more than once - but it's only common sense to me that Lola should have had a tutu and a throne for her ""100th birthday"", considering her rocky journey in life. 'She's really like one of my children.' Karen narrowly saved Lola and Lola's puppy Tia from a cloud of toxic smoke which filled her house when a coffee pot melted in an unexplained fire. She said: 'I raced through the house looking for them. 'Both the dogs were succumbing to the fumes and I had to practically throw Lola through an open door into the fresh air. Lola pictured sitting on her throne (l) and a wide shot of the throne and 10-tier birthday cake . The pair were joined by dozens of doggy friends who tucked into cake and enjoyed live entertainment . 'By the time I found Tia she was nearly dead. I had to give her mouth to mouth. 'We had to take both dogs to intensive care at the Royal Veterinary College in London where they stayed for two weeks, at a cost of £18,000. We almost lost them several times. 'The vets told us we should prepare ourselves for the fact that they wouldn't live for another five years. I was devastated, but I took them home and nursed them as best I could. It took them a full year to properly recover. 'Lola survived the five years, and then another, and I began to think, 'wow, she's a real survivor'.' Last year, as Lola approached her 10th birthday, Karen decided to throw an extra-special bash to celebrate her eldest dog's life so far. Karen also keeps five other bulldogs, Baby Gracie, 6, triplets Angel Star, Lil' Belle and Scarley Sky, 4, and King, 9 months, who with her fiance Pete Dowling, 5. Lola arrives at the party with Karen and her fiance Pete Dowling, 51 . She said: 'I invited all our dog-mad friends. I wanted it to be a very glamorous evening. 'The dress code was quite strict - I wanted all the ladies and gents to be dressed in their finest gear and their dogs were to wear fancy dress. We had one dog dressed up as Prince Charming, and others were dyed especially for the occasion.' The venue, the Beach Club marquee at the Kings Oak Hotel in Loughton, Essex, cost £1,000 to hire for the night. Lola's dress cost £150, and her tiara cost another £100. The decorations, food and entertainment, including a specially-constructed throne, a 10-tier cupcake tower, individual treat bowls, celebrity lookalikes and dancers, brought the total cost to £5,000.

She enjoys playing with her toys a bit too much sometimes and still gets excited meeting other dogs. 'Every day we take her for two short walks and when we're going longer distances we take her out in her stroller. She loves walking on the sand.

ff19ca4fe818632a36a368cda07e9ba8a5ce118d,"(CNN) -- The last time Arsenal led the English Premier League by as much as five points, it was February 2008. So it's no surprise that Arsene Wenger, whose last silverware came three years before that, is not getting carried away. The veteran manager knows, after all, that a few days is a long time in football. On Tuesday his team lost 2-0 to Chelsea in the League Cup, which many trumpeted as a sign that Jose Mourinho's side had taken the ascendancy and would be the dominant force this season. But on Saturday Mourinho's men crashed 2-0 to Newcastle, which had lost to the EPL's bottom side Sunderland the previous weekend, and Arsenal earned a five-point lead at the top with a comprehensive win by the same score against another title hopeful, Liverpool. Arsenal's pre-season target Luis Suarez and fellow in-form striker Daniel Sturridge barely had a look-in for Liverpool, which had scored 12 goals in the past four games. Santi Cazorla volleyed a 19th-minute opener after his header hit the post, and Aaron Ramsey joined Sturridge on 10 goals in all competitions just before the hour mark when the Wales midfielder was given time to shoot from outside the penalty area. ""I am always confident, but of course there is a long way to go,"" Wenger said. ""Today was an important win for the team. ""It was vital to win, I said that before the game and I don't change my mind, because had we not won people would say 'Yes, Arsenal at home they cannot win the big games.' ""The Chelsea game was an important game but not of the importance of today's game. But still, it was a disappointment and it was important to respond today, to convince people that we can win these big games. ""We had a good solidarity, a good focus, and I believe we have plenty of other big games coming up and this will help us deal well with them."" On Wednesday, the Gunners will travel to Germany to face Borussia Dortmund in a match which will have a big bearing on the London club's hopes of progressing to the knockout stage of the Champions League. ""Who would have said that Chelsea would lose today at Newcastle after Tuesday night? But that's the Premier League and it's down to consistency,"" Wenger said. ""We are consistent since the first of January 2013, with the same group (of players). We have shown since our massive blip against Aston Villa (at the start of this season) that we have been very consistent. We have 10 games, 25 points."" While Wenger appears calm, Mourinho admitted to being worried after the Newcastle defeat left his Chelsea side in second place, above Liverpool on goal difference. ""I'm angry because I don't understand it,"" said the former Real Madrid manager, who won two EPL titles in his first season at the London club. ""Of course I am worried, and I read in previous years it happened the same. ""Chelsea were successful in cup competitions but not successful in the Premier League. Last year in December, they were not in the race for the title because they were already 20 points behind."" Mourinho made nine changes to his team, and complained: ""I made 11 mistakes. I should have picked another 11 and not this one."" While the Portuguese coach's fortunes may have momentarily dipped, those of the Manchester clubs soared this weekend. Defending champion Manchester United won 3-1 at Fulham, the fourth victory in a row in all competitions for under-pressure manager David Moyes -- who saw Antonio Valencia, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney score in the first half as his side stayed eighth. Manchester City moved up to fourth -- six points behind Arsenal -- with a 7-0 thrashing of third-bottom Norwich, having lost at Chelsea last Sunday. England goalkeeper Joe Hart was dropped following his costly blunder at the end of that match, and his Romanian replacement Costel Pantilimon has now kept two clean sheets following the midweek League Cup win at Newcastle. Sergio Aguero's eighth league goal this season moved the Argentina striker to the top of the scoring charts alongside Sturridge, while Yaya Toure hit his fifth, Alvaro Negredo his fourth and Edin Dzeko his third among seven individual scorers. Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic was also a notable name on the scoresheets after his wind-assisted effort deceived Southampton counterpart Artur Boruc after just 13 seconds. The Bosnia international became the fifth keeper to hit the target since the EPL began in 1992, while Jay Rodriguez's equalizer left Saints in fifth place, behind City on goal difference. ""As a manager that is the first time I've had to experience a moment as unlucky as that,"" said Southampton's Mauricio Pochettino. ""I don't blame him at all. I think it had more to do with the weather conditions. ""He didn't apologize for anything because he didn't have to. The wind was changing gusts completely all the time and it is a ground which is open on three sides, which makes it even more windy."" West Brom moved up to 11th with a 2-0 win that dropped Crystal Palace to the bottom of the table, despite nine-man Sunderland losing 1-0 at 10th-placed Hull. West Ham drew 0-0 with Aston Villa in Saturday's other match.","Arsenal leads EPL by five points after beating title rival Liverpool 2-0 Saturday .

ff1a1bf1f9716e40069ed8ed70611c35d7eec3ba,"(CNN) -- For the first time since a reported massacre there, U.N. observers on Saturday entered the Syrian town of Tremseh, where opposition activists say more than 200 people were killed. The violence took place Thursday, on what may have been the single deadliest day in the 16-month crisis. It prompted a fresh round of condemnation from world leaders. In Tremseh, the U.N. team found evidence of an attack, including a burned school, damaged houses, and proof that artillery, mortars and small arms were used, said Sausan Ghosheh, spokeswoman for the head of the U.N. Supervising Mission in Syria. She added that the number of causalities remains unclear. ""The attack ... appeared targeted at specific groups and houses, mainly of army defectors and activists. There were pools of blood and blood spatters in rooms of several homes together with bullet cases,"" Ghosheh said in a statement. U.N. observers are expected to return to the town Sunday to continue their fact-finding work. Still grappling with the attack, Syrians endured yet another bloody day Saturday as regime forces fired from low-flying helicopters and a bomb exploded at a state security headquarters, opposition activists said. At least 73 people were killed in Saturday violence, including 20 in Homs, 11 in Damascus Suburbs and 13 in Hama province, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Fourteen additional deaths were reported in Deir Ezzor and 12 in Idlib, among others. Another opposition group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said a car bombing targeted a state security building in Hama, and ""a number of state security personnel were killed and wounded."" Syrian state-run TV said at least three civilians and a security officer were killed in Muhrada by a suicide bomber in a truck. Farther south, the Daraa province town of Khirbet Ghazaleh came under heavy shelling and machine gun fire after the Syrian army surrounded it with tanks, the LCC said. ""Helicopters fly over the city at a low altitude with a continued siege of the city and gunfire from snipers,"" the opposition network said. Meanwhile, Deir Ezzor was subject to intense shelling by government forces, as well as fierce clashes between regime forces and the Free Syrian Army, the LCC said. How long can al-Assad hang on? According to the opposition network, more than 200 villagers were killed in the Hama-area town of Tremseh on Thursday, and dozens more were killed elsewhere across the country. U.N. spokeswoman Ghosheh said a large patrol had been sent from Damascus to Tremseh on Saturday to assess the situation, amid widely differing accounts of what happened from opposition activists and the government. An initial reconnaissance mission was sent Friday following assurances of a cease-fire in the area, the spokeswoman said, but it was too late in the day to do much. ""The patrol assessed the situation -- if there was in fact a cease-fire and our access to the town,"" she said. ""An 11 vehicle integrated patrol, comprised of specialized military and civilian observers, arrived ... on Saturday after confirming that a cease-fire was in place."" International anger against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has ratcheted up since the Tremseh incident, with at least one U.S. official suggesting the need for more pressure on al-Assad's regime. As outrage grows in Syria, report of a 'breakthrough' for humanitarian aid . ""Through these repeated acts of violence against the Syrian people, President Assad has lost legitimacy to lead. It is time for him to go. It is time for the political transition that is long overdue to finally get under way,"" Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, told reporters Friday. ""It certainly does build strong international support ... to continue to ramp up the pressure on Assad,"" he added, citing ""ongoing conversations at the United Nations about additional ways that we can build some international agreement and raise the stakes even further."" Syria moving chemical weapons? Activists in the city of Hama, meanwhile, gave a grisly account of the assault in Tremseh. Witnesses inside the town told the activists by telephone that Syrian military forces had launched a full-scale attack against the opposition Free Syrian Army inside the town, which was surrounded by government tanks and artillery. As the government forces rained artillery rounds into the town, a number of village residents fled their houses, going into the streets, where many of them were shot dead by the government militias, the activists told CNN. The government painted a starkly different picture of Tremseh than that detailed by opposition groups. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency blamed ""armed terrorist groups"" for the violence. It said the government said residents called security forces for help after the terrorist groups raided the neighborhood. Regime forces arrested some of the members of the terrorist groups and confiscated their weapons, the government said. Syria's detached and deluded elite? ""Armed forces successfully dealt with the terrorists without casualties taking place among the citizens. They searched into the terrorists' dens where they found the dead bodies of a number of citizens who had been abducted and killed by the terrorist groups,"" SANA reported, citing a military source. CNN cannot independently verify reports from Syria because the nation has restricted access by international journalists. Meanwhile, many who survive the violence are caught in a precarious humanitarian situation. The chief U.N. organization that coordinates emergency aid warned Friday that more Syrians will die if contributing nations do not follow through and fund its relief operation.

ff1a1f3611e2e222e9d7c813a6aa706d239347c4,"Editor's note: Thomas Levenson is a professor at MIT, where he heads the Graduate Program in Science Writing. He is the author of a new book, ""Newton and the Counterfeiter"" and an award-winning filmmaker, with 10 documentaries on science broadcast on PBS. Thomas Levenson says Isaac Newton's bad gamble shows financial regulation has always been needed. (CNN) -- From winter to spring 1720, London, England, was delirious, entranced, rolling in money. It seemed as if riches were so easily gained that only fools would not buy into that brand new engine of wealth, the stock exchange, and especially into shares of the enterprise leading the boom, a banking concern called the South Sea Company. As spring turned into summer, no one, it seemed, could deny the obvious, not even the most rational of men. So, in June and again in July, Sir Isaac Newton -- the inventor of calculus (the branch of mathematics that describes change over time, which is to say, an awful lot of what matters in both science and life); the man who framed the laws of motion and set physics on its modern trajectory; a pioneering chemist, an inventor (virtually all present-day telescopes derive from his design), a religious historian -- and even a financial thinker -- put a sizable chunk of his personal fortune into shares of the South Sea Company. The bubble burst that September. Newton lost 90 percent of his stake -- a substantial fraction of his total worth. In that loss can be found the key to the debate we are having right now in the wake of the Obama administration's move to re-regulate American financial markets. Arguments over the supervision of financial transactions occur in the wake of every bubble. Opponents of such regulation always return to the same simple claim. They say that investors are grown-ups, capable of making the best assessments of their own interests and acting accordingly. Markets are thus no more than self-correcting mechanisms for connecting such rational actors, and any attempt to impose rules on their interaction will only render them less efficient. Those in favor say that all this is nonsense, that in the real world, markets are not populated by equally well-informed people analyzing their own circumstances and acting accordingly -- and that every financial collapse thus takes down both those who should have known better and those who couldn't have hoped to. Hence, they say, an active enforcer needs to provide a level playing field and to deter actual fraud. Painfully recent experience suggests that's true enough -- but Newton's case suggests a deeper necessity at the heart of the case for proactive regulation. What happened to him, or rather, how he acted, reveals a fundamental truth of economic and emotional life: At the point of crisis, when clear thought and a cool head matter most, no one is in fact a rational actor -- not even the greatest scientific mind of his or any other age. So what brought Newton low? Desire, perhaps envy, or, in other words, human nature. Newton had been an active trader in the new stock market for years before the bubble year of 1720. He made his first investment in the South Sea issue early, in 1713, and held it for several years, marking a modest paper profit. He held on through early 1720, as the company pursued a new and increasingly risky banking deal -- and as insiders began to talk up the (as it turned out, fictitious) trading profits the company expected from another venture. That got the desired result, a sudden leap in stock prices. Starting at £128 in January, the price for South Sea securities rose to £175 in February and then £330 in March. Newton kept his head -- at first. He sold in April, content with his (quite spectacular) gains to date. But then, between April and June, share prices tripled, reaching over £1,000 ... which is precisely when he could stand it no longer. Having ""lost"" two thirds of his potential gain, Newton bought again at the very top, and bought more after a slight decline in July. If that sounds familiar, it should, at least to buyers of Webvan in 2000, just before the Internet bubble burst -- or, for that matter, to those who picked up Lehman Brothers shares in winter 2008. The South Sea stock price held up through August 1720, and then in September, the gap between the possible income from all the purchased debt and the returns promised to investors became too obvious to ignore. The bubble burst, and South Sea share prices collapsed to roughly their pre-bubble level. Newton's losses totaled as much as £20,000, between $4 million and $5 million in 21st century terms. The catastrophe did not sink him; he had made other, more cautious investments, including a significant stake in the East India Company, and when he died in 1727, his estate was valued at £30,000 pounds. But it was a terrific blow, even so. Here's why this story matters now. Of all people, Newton should have known better. He had, after all, invented the mathematics that could expose the impossibility of the South Sea Company's promise of returns to be paid to an everlasting stream of new investors. And yet, even he could not resist the prospect of infinite returns on his money. Hence, the obligation to regulate. There is plenty of recent academic research that confirms that bubbles -- including the ones we've just endured -- are not unique disasters, but the predictable consequences of human behavior in the context of implausible rewards. What Newton's experience tells us is that this has been true since the beginning of modern markets -- and that mere intelligence, even genius, doesn't help. Isaac Newton said so himself. After the disaster, he could not bear to hear the phrase ""South Sea"" mentioned in his presence. But just once he admitted that while he knew how to predict the motions of the cosmos, ""he could not calculate the madness of the people."" We still can't. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Levenson.","Thomas Levenson: Isaac Newton was a mathematical, scientific genius .

ff1a5c5af5ca4f312a985ab02335390df1fadc8a,"A Toronto illustrator has launched a Twitter campaign that he hopes will draw more attention to the rising number of missing and murdered native Canadian women across the country. Evan Munday, who writes and illustrates picture books, is drawing black-and-white cartoons of  the over 1,186 missing indigenous women and then tweeting one sketch to Canada's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, each day. He launched the campaign on Monday as a reaction to recent comments Harper made about the number of missing and murdered women in the country, to which Harper responded: 'It isn't really high on our radar, to be honest.' 'Just hearing him say that, it was just such a glib non-answer that it was the catalyst for me doing this,' Munday told CBC News. Campaigner: Illustrator Evan Munday (left) will tweet a drawing of one missing or murdered inidigenous Canadian woman each day in the hopes of forcing Prime Minister Stephen Harper to act on the issue . Not on his radar: Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper recently said a public inquiry into the amount of native women to go missing or be murdered 'isn't really high on our radar' Munday hopes his drawings might help bring about a formal inquiry into the matter through the power of Twitter. 'I hope it's not viewed as offensive,' Munday added to the network. 'Part of it is trying to do a tribute and thinking about them and their lives as I do the drawing.' The figure of missing women is from the last 30 years. Munday is sourcing pictures of the women online and then sketching them in blank ink. Munday hopes enough people will get behind his campaign that it will 'change the radar' of the PM and how he feels about the issue. He is the illustrator of the novel Stripmalling, and the author and illustrator of the graphic novel series Quarter-Life Crisis. Munday is perhaps best known though for the The Dead Kid Detective Agency series. He hit headlines in a similar capacity in December during the anniversary of the École Polytechnique de Montréal massacre. The mass shooting at the university on on December 6, 1989, and of the 28 people shot, 14 were killed. Munday did portraits of each of the victims in the same style as his missing persons ones and put them on Twitter. He told BuzzFeed News that after that the made made him 'think about how violence against women is still happening all the time in Canada, and it effects women of indigenous background disproportionately'. He also realized that 'many indigenous women’s organizations and activist groups and families of the missing women have called for a public inquiry into this epidemic, and how those calls have fallen on mostly deaf ears'. The comments made by Harper that affected Munday were said during the Prime Minister's end-of-year interview with the CBC. Harper was asked whether he planned to initiate a formal inquiry into the whereabouts of missing indigenous women, because calls for such had been rejected in the past. 'It isn’t really high on our radar, to be honest,' Harper said. 'Ministers will continue to dialogue with those who are concerned about it.' Munday told BuzzFeed that, so long as he can source photos of the missing women, he hopes to draw them all, and doesn't care if it takes years.","Toronto based illustrator and author Evan Munday is sketching cartoons of missing or murder indigenous Canadian by finding photos online .

The 32-year-old was expected to be out for around a month but a subsequent problem with his ankle means rehabilitation will take 'approximately three months'. Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta has been ruled out for three months after surgery on his ankle . Arteta was substituted in the victory over Borussia Dortmund in November and has not featured since . Mathieu Debuchy will also be sidelined until April following shoulder surgery on the injury he sustained in Arsenal's 3-0 win against Stoke. The France international has only recently returned to action after he suffered an injury in the 2-2 draw against Manchester City at the Emirates in September. 'It's very unfortunate for Mathieu, it's unbelievable because he's had two surgeries in the same season,' said Arsene Wenger. Mathieu Debuchy dislocated his shoulder after colliding with Stoke's Marko Arnautovic in the 3-0 victory . 'He just came back, he played seven games and he's out again. I count three months out for Mathieu because contact will be a problem for the shoulder.' On Arteta, manager Wenger added: 'Mikel has had surgery which went well. I have just seen him, he is back with us at the training ground. 'He had a limited mobility in his ankle and some persistent inflammation that had an impact on his calf. 'That meant we had to make the decision to have surgery and it's a proper solution which gives him the best chance to recover.'","Mikel Arteta had surgery on ankle and faces three months of rehabilitation .

ff1aff77ef4e9f5e55fcdcd7508ac09c2d1a5b38,"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Fed-up Scottish voters have flocked to a new art exhibition lampooning the warring independence camps, with just two weeks to go before the historic September 18 poll. Glasgow's Veneer Gallery has been taken aback by the public interest in a new show featuring tongue-in-cheek images mocking the Yes and No teams. It comes as Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling ramp up their campaigns to win over the remaining undecided voters. The paintings, by Scottish artist Dominic Currie, 56, are inspired by cult pop artist Roy Liechtenstein and American comic books. They include a unique take on Liechtenstein's Drowning Girl, with the speech bubble altered to say: ‘Ah dinnae care. I'd rether sink than vote yes!’ Referendum-inspired Scottish Pop Art by Fife artist Dominic Currie is being displayed at the Veneer Gallery, Glasgow . Another features Margaret Thatcher's face with the slogan 'Better To Get Her'. Another depicts a group of young boys urinating on a wall beneath a window from which Alistair Darling is watching. Mr Currie said he decided to create his artwork because he was ‘absolutely fed up of the Punch and Judy show’ involving Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond. He said: ‘I would say for the average punter in the street it's been a total turn-off. It's not been any advert for empowering people. ‘The whole campaign has been absolutely negative and throwing insults. Nobody knows what's going to happen. ‘I thought to myself what you need is a bit of tongue-in-cheek satire and maybe even give people a bit of something to think about.’ The Methil artist said the Margaret Thatcher image came to him as he felt no matter who Scotland voted for in past elections, they always got ‘Margaret Thatcher politics’. And according to Mr Currie, the urinating boys picture is ‘Better Together in action’. He said: ‘It's just taken off. I never thought I would do this in any serious way.’ Mr Currie’s referendum series is currently on display in Glasgow's Veneer Gallery and he has already sold a huge number of prints. His original Drowning Girl painting was snapped up on the launch night. One of the images depicts a group of young boys urinating on a wall below a window where Alistair Darling is standing . Currie used the Pop Art images to poke fun at both sides in the referendum debate . The images are inspired by American-pop artist Roy Lichtenstein and characters from comic books . It comes as Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond goes head to head with the No campaign over threats to the economy. Mr Salmond will set out his vision of the gains of independence for the food and drink industry on a visit to Eden Mill distillery and brewery in Guardbridge, Fife. Meanwhile, shadow Scottish secretary Margaret Curran and Labour MSP Iain Gray will be at Glasgow's Tennent Caledonian Breweries to highlight jobs and opportunities they say will be available as part of the UK. Today is the deadline for Scots to register to vote in the referendum on September 18. The latest YouGov poll shows support for independence has risen eight points in a month, with the No camp now six points ahead of the Yes campaign. Excluding undecided voters, 53 per cent plan to vote No, while 47 per cent would back Yes. Speaking ahead of his visit, Mr Salmond said: ‘Scotland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and our booming food and drink industry is just one of our remarkable success stories in recent years. ‘More and more people are waking up to the fact that Scotland has a strong and diverse economy on which we can build a more prosperous future with control of key economic levers. ‘Scotland is currently in the international spotlight like never before, but the huge publicity generated by a Yes vote - and the transition to independence - will be the opportunity of a lifetime for our food and drink sector to extend its global reach even further.’ Mr Salmond said the Scottish Government had been working with the industry on a £4.5 million food and drink export plan. He added: ‘Following a Yes vote, we will sit down with industry and Food and Drink Scotland to discuss how we can supplement that plan to take full advantage of the unprecedented global publicity, creating thousands of jobs in Scotland and boosting our exports.’ Fife-based painter Dominic Currie has put together 11 individual pieces - including a take on Liechtenstein's Drowning Girl, with the speech bubble altered to say: 'Ah dinnae care. I'd rether sink than vote yes!' Ms Curran argued that young people in Scotland would benefit from more job opportunities within the UK. She said: ‘Around one million jobs in Scotland rely on companies based elsewhere in the UK and many more are with companies that rely on trade with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. ‘Young people across Scotland can't afford to have opportunities cut off. ‘'We want a strong Scotland backed up by a strong United Kingdom. Being part of the UK means that we can share our resources across the country. 'Scots are squeezed between two governments with the wrong priorities. Neither the Tories nor the SNP are giving our young people the chances they need to succeed.’ Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Labour MP Jim Murphy is due to resume his 100 streets in 100 days tour in Edinburgh's Princes Street.","Glasgow's Veneer Gallery taken aback by public interest in a new show .

Investigation: Katie Bowman has alleged that the force harassed her after she split with PC Ash . A graduate who claims to be the victim of a police harassment campaign was allowed to access the Police National Computer during patrol car rides with her former boyfriend. Katie Bowman was just 18 when she was allowed to make checks on number plates and even file reports of cars that had been stopped during the jaunts with a serving officer, PC Alexander Ash. In other incidents, she alleges that she and PC Ash handcuffed each other to a desk at a police station and that she wore his body armour. Forensic science graduate Miss Bowman, now 24, has already alleged that officers at Thames Valley Police have made her life a misery after she split with PC Ash, stopping her more than 70 times for alleged offences. She claims to have been targeted because she had broken up with PC Ash after finding out he had another girlfriend. Until last night, the force had sought to downplay the allegations but it has now launched an inquiry into them. But yesterday it responded to revelations that PC Ash, 31, took Miss Bowman on ‘ride-alongs’ in his patrol car and even let her request searches on the heavily restricted PNC. Counter claim: PC Alexander Ash at his wedding in May . Miss Bowman says for the next two years after she split up with PC Ash she was breath tested 70 times during a campaign of harassment . His activities had been exposed by an internal probe in 2008 but he escaped with a fine and reprimand for misconduct. Last . night Thames Valley Deputy Chief Constable Francis Habgood apologised, . admitting ‘it would appear that the conduct of a few officers has fallen . short’. He confirmed that PC Ash had been disciplined in 2008, prompted . by Miss Bowman’s complaints, and he suggested the officer could now . lose his job. Mr . Habgood said: ‘These officers behaved in a totally unacceptable way. Were this to happen today I strongly believe the outcome would be very . different.’ Documents from . an internal investigation, obtained by Miss Bowman and seen by the . Mail, describe a recording of Miss Bowman requesting information on the . PNC and filling out forms on behalf of PC Ash. Miss Bowman said: ‘Alex used to be on patrol on his own so I used to meet him and spend the rest of the shift in the car. He would let me wear his body armour, hat and belt. ‘I would do the vehicle checks over the radio and write out the forms for him.’ Miss Bowman, who has never been convicted of a crime, says for the next two year after she split up with PC Ash she was breath tested 70 times during a campaign of harassment by his colleagues. Report: How the Mail covered the story on Thursday . Complaint: Katie Bowman claims her life was made a misery . Despite never securing a conviction . against her, Miss Bowman said the officers filed up to 40 damning . intelligence reports which saw her fired from two jobs and rejected from . a third after Criminal Records Bureau checks. PC Ash claimed earlier this week that he was ‘never in a relationship’ with Miss Bowman and only met her twice. Miss Bowman, now pregnant and engaged, claims she was also forced to flee her home in Marlow and move to Bedfordshire. She said: ‘As soon as I moved it all miraculously stopped. And even though it has, I’m having to try to clear my name because I’m terrified for the future, I can’t get a job.’ Miss Bowman has the support of her local MP, Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who has branded the damaging files on her as ‘utterly trivial’. Thames Valley Police removed almost half of the 40 intelligence reports after a review. The remainder will be reviewed once again in the latest probe. Deputy Chief Constable Habgood said last night: ‘It is essential that the people we serve can have absolute trust and confidence in us to conduct ourselves with integrity and professionalism at all times. 'It would appear that in this case the conduct of a few officers has fallen short of this.’ Welcoming the review, Miss Bowman said: ‘I’m happy they’ve agreed to investigate this but it is long overdue.’","Katie Bowman was 18 when she had access to confidential police data .

ff1b4fedf806ae852e78da05604cc1f62bc5936e,"(Rolling Stone) -- The past month has been a time of frenzied activity for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. They taped two TV appearances, played special gigs at the Apollo Theater and SXSW, and launched a world tour in support of Springsteen's new LP, ""Wrecking Ball."" Late last week, Rolling Stone chatted separately with E Street Band guitarists Steven Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren about the new E Street Band and how they're carrying on after the loss of Clarence Clemons. Rolling Stone: You guys almost always do rehearsal shows before launching a big tour. Why didn't those happen this time? Nils Lofgren: Previously, the rehearsal shows were kind of a last-minute thing. I think probably what happened is that we were putting our own show together, which inevitably heads towards rehearsal shows. But because of the new record, we made commitments. We did the Grammys, two nights on ""Jimmy Fallon"" and the Apollo Show. Next on the horizon was the SXSW show. All of a sudden it was like, ""Gosh, we have five different shows to prepare."" Bruce always takes the time to slant the shows to the occasion, and we had to get our own show up and we just ran out of time. Steven Van Zandt: It was interesting to witness our own extremes with the Apollo Show and the SXSW show. We went from emphasizing soul music at the Apollo to flipping 180 degrees for a Woody Guthrie celebration at SXSW. It was quite interesting to have that reinforced and have it be totally integrated in the work -- not doing either extreme as a sort of specialty, gimmicky show, but actually having those roots so firmly planted in the material -- and to be reminded how wide and varied the identity of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band actually is at this point. It's some kind of example of Americana in all of its forms. Rolling Stone: It was a pretty bold move to debut the new band and new show at the Apollo, considering it was being broadcast live. Van Zandt: To do our first show as a broadcast, that's real balls. I'm proud of us for pulling it off. It was pretty close to flawless, I have to say. Keep in mind, we have a brand new five-piece horn section. We're still working on horn parts. We're still working on vocal parts with the singers. We have a couple new people involved. I took it for granted, but they were probably a bit nervous. They did great, though. We spent a lot of time thinking about this show and talking about it. The horn section was a good answer to the unanswerable: ""How do you replace Clarence Clemons?"" Well, you don't. It's real simple. The same way you replace Danny Federici. You don't. You have somebody else playing those parts, but you have to do something else, you have to morph it into a hybrid of what you were. It's not going to be the same. Rolling Stone: How long ago did rehearsals begin? Lofgren: They've been off and on, but we got together in the second week of January. We had to address what was in front of us, which was a lot, and kind of take our time and experiment and let things evolve. There's so many changes. Certainly the biggest change of all is Clarence, which is a terrible loss. I've been in the band for 28 years, and I'm pretty sure it's accurate to say that the band has never gone on the road with three-and-a-half albums of new material. When Bruce put out the ""Darkness On The Edge of Town"" package, there were 23 unreleased songs and they never toured behind that. And then you had 11 new songs. All this material is really valid and great and we've never integrated it into our show, which is already hundreds of songs that we haven't presented in over two years. It was an abnormal amount of new material to disseminate. It's just a giant, beautiful jigsaw puzzle of music. Van Zandt: Usually we start rehearsals two weeks before the first show and kick around some ideas for the set, maybe do six rehearsals, period. Each tour has its own energy, and the writing is the script for the show. It's like a Broadway show or a movie. You have to start with the script, and that's always a new album for us. We've never been a nostalgia band. Every single time we go out, we're saying something new, something that's been on Bruce's mind in that period. In this case, instead of our usual five or six days, we did 10 or 12. We probably had 40 horn charts. That's a lot of work just to outline the charts, never mind tweak them and really get into the details of arranging, which, of course, I love to do, and Bruce is also really good at. So that's going on, and we have to integrate this new album, adapt it -- in this case, a little more adaptation, because it was a solo album. This is the first time this has ever happened, where he's touring with the E Street Band behind a solo album. But it's good, and we had the whole new album down in two days. Then you start kicking around ideas and doing older things. ""My City of Ruins"" ended up playing a major role in this show, really for the first time. It's always been an emotional song but sort of a specialty song, maybe an encore. This time it ended up playing a very, very different and central role. This is the most difficult task ever. How do you address Clarence and Danny? How do you address that? You talk to ten different people and they're going to have ten different ideas. But it's really not easy. You're trying to do something that's very, very emotional, and at the same time, you don't want to make the show a funeral. You want to make sure the show is a celebration of life. It's a very delicate, very fine line to walk. And (Bruce) comes up with this rap -- it's so f****** great, and so perfect. I'm awestruck. This guy still inspires me after 45 f****** years of doing this. I'm like, ""Jesus Christ, that's so f****** good, so important."" It's such an important moment in the show...It's probably the best start of a tour, I think ever, honestly. Rolling Stone: I'm sure it was hard the first time you walked onstage without Clarence. Lofgren: The first time that hit me the hardest was the Grammys. I'm standing there, and there's nobody to my right. It hit me hard. That's someone I'll miss the rest of my life, but I still love playing and it doesn't take away from the power of the songs of the band. Van Zandt: It's emotional for me to walk onstage without Clarence, and it always will be. I still honestly once in a while get that feeling with Danny. I look over there and say, ""Oh yeah, Danny's no longer..."" That's never going to change. So I think the more people onstage, the more that helps. The more the configuration is different, the more that eases your emotional pain. In other words, you're not trying to replace them, you're doing a different thing. Through the years, since we started playing in 1965, you do a lot of different things. I've been in horn bands. I've been in country bands. You go into 100 different configurations in your life. Now it feels like another one. It's almost like you're in a different band, in a sense, even though the core of the band is still there. See the full article at RollingStone.com.

Oh my God .... get! Oh my God, oh my God,"" he yells. The dispatcher seems concerned about Tuller. ""Sir, are you in a safe position to go in by yourself?"" the dispatcher asks. ""I'm here, I'm here,"" he says. ""OK, we don't want you to get injured though, we don't want you to get hurt,"" the dispatcher says. ""Yeah, I hear what you're saying,"" Tuller says.

'In sheltered inland areas of England and Wales we expect to see low temperatures of around -1C while in London it's more like 2C.' This is a staggering 14C lower than the temperature in the capital last night. Mr Partridge added: 'But it will be clear and crisp with light winds - which really is perfect weather for Bonfire Night. 'From Monday, the weather will start to feel normal for November and there will certainly be a marked difference from the unusually warm nights we have been experiencing.

The unstoppable Duck Dynasty is on course to snatch cable TV's ratings record from The Walking dead after 11.8 million viewers tuned in to watch the start of the new season. The boss of A&E Network's is cautiously optimistic that the hilarious exploits of a Louisiana family and their duck merchandise business still has plenty of room to grow. With some 'fun episodes coming down the pike', the show needs just 600,000 more viewers to equal current record holder, zombie fest The Walking Dead, which recorded the highest ever ratings for a show of any kind when 12.4 million people tuned in earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Dynasty: The show's stars (from left) Phil Robertson, Jase Robertson, Si Robertson and Willie Robertson . Big guns: The stars of Duck Dynasty are competing with scripted shows such as The Walking Dead . The business: The hilarious exploits of the Robertson family are on course to break all records for cable TV . A&E Network's general manager and executive vice-president David McKillop was reported by Today as saying: 'I’m a superstitious man so I don’t make (ratings) predictions. 'But do I think we’ve found the ceiling yet? I don’t know, but I don’t think so. We have some fun episodes coming down the pike. So keep your seat belt fastened.' Last week's ratings put Duck Dynasty at the top of the pile for highest ever audience tuning in to watch an unscripted show. The record was previously held by TLC's Jon & Kate Plus 8, which claimed 10.6 million viewers back in 2009. But with 6.3 million viewers in the coveted 18-49 age group, and a total increase of 37 per cent on the third season's premiere, Duck Dynasty's rise looks set to continue. Popular: Characters such as Uncle Si have helped establish the show as a firm favourite in American households . The show first aired in March 2012 and . averaged 1.3 million viewers, according . to data provided by Nielsen. By the time the third series drew to a close an average of 8.4 million had tuned in. According to Mr McKillop, part of the show's appeal lays in the clean living Christian values of the Robertson family, who live in the backwoods of West Monroe. Their feet remain firmly on the ground, despite amassing a fortune from their duck sporting empire, Duck Commander. The firm specialises in top-of-the-range duck calls and decoys, made from swamp wood, and employs many local people. Big bucks: The Robertson family has made a fortune from its duck merchandise business, making items such as this duck call . Spin-off: Figurines such as this one of Jase have proven to be a hit with fans of the show . It was built by Phil Robertson - who turned down the opportunity to play professional football because it interfered with the duck season - with the help of his son Willie. Part of their charismatic charm lies in their wish to stay grounded by keeping their guns and beards no matter how wealthy they become. And while their arguments are often hilarious, they never swear. Mr McKillop said: 'Hijinx is a word that I use to describe the kind of zeitgeist of their compound. But they represent some real values that people still cherish.' Show stopper: Millions tuned in last week to watch Kay and Phil renew their wedding vows . Last Wednesday's fourth season opener . saw Phil and Kay renew their wedding vows causing prompting 325,000 . tweets from love-sick fans. America's Got Talent recorded just 65,000.

Mr McKillop added: 'Social has played a major role in getting the word out. 'It all helps generate buzz and what it does is it lifts it from a TV show to a part of American pop culture. Once you’re up there in that bastion of American pop culture, you’re on top.'

ff1d89ab3544f7a67fd96cd965e352c8dc252a41,"(CNN) -- ""At the end of six seasons, six beautiful seasons, it's like high school -- time to graduate and go to college,"" Mike ""The Situation"" Sorrentino told CNN as he and his cast mates bid farewell to their MTV hit ""Jersey Shore"" at the New York Television Festival. And just like after high school, it's time for the ""Jersey Shore"" cast to really get to work, just like the reality TV stars who came before them. The ""Jersey Shore"" cast members are all expanding their empires while also giving back to the community that made them famous, via a planned one-hour fund-raiser to rebuild the actual Jersey Shore, which was devastated along with other areas on the East Coast during Hurricane Sandy. ""Restore the Shore"" will be broadcast live from Times Square on Thursday, November 15, at 11 p.m. ET and tape-delayed on the West Coast. Unlike the graduates of ""American Idol,"" ""Project Runway,"" or even ""The Hills,"" the self-proclaimed guidos of the ""Jersey Shore"" represent a region. Love them or hate them (or love to hate them), the TV special may bolster their reputations (not to mention their brands) when they might have been criticized for leaving the area a little worse for wear. ""I think of everyone in the celebrity world, we get bullied the most,"" said Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi. ""People are just mean to us. Yes, I got drunk, I blacked out, I got arrested, but that's what happens to everybody. They just don't have a camera following them."" The final episode of ""Jersey Shore"" airs December 13, and with the end in sight, the cast are thinking about what to do when the party's over, spinoffs notwithstanding. Sammi Giancola is going back to college to finish her sociology degree. Ruthie Alcaide from season eight of ""The Real World,"" who became a spokesperson for alcohol awareness, might provide a role model for Sorrentino, whose own situation also involved a stint in rehab. He doesn't think his hard-won sobriety had anything to do with the show coming to an end, but now that he's famous, he can't see himself falling back on his former career as a mortgage broker. ""I can't be 'the Situation' forever,"" he acknowledged, adding that he hopes to milk it for a little while longer (at least until the next TV gig comes along). He's also written a comic book using his ""Jersey Shore"" persona as a superhero: ""By day he is Mike, almost like Clark Kent, and by night, he is 'the Situation,' who has the power of persuasion with females and gets that power from a tanning bed."" Sorrentino also hopes to make other endorsement and branding deals, pending an unresolved suit from Viacom over copyright of phrases that originated on the show. The highest-earning member of the ""Jersey Shore"" cast, Paul ""Pauly D"" DelVecchio, who banked a reported $11 million last year, knows he can't rely on his reality-TV fame. The DJ signed with 50 Cent's record label and is coproducing an album with the rap mogul. (He's also partnered with 50 to put out a line of headphones and will DJ Britney Spears' wedding). ""I'm actually applying for unemployment now that the show's ending,"" he joked. ""But I hear they pay you less now, so that's not going to work."" Already a queen of branding, Polizzi has more deals for her own fashion and beauty lines than the rest of the cast: indoor and sunless tanning, slippers, sunglasses, perfume, jewelry and a maternity line on the way. But this isn't enough, she said, so she's also getting into the music business, because the brands are not her long game. ""My parents, they're just trying to get everything out of this moment, and they want to have a family business, so we started Team Snooki Music,"" she said. ""We're just trying to make a living so my kids can go to college, and they don't have to worry about anything. You have to plan."" Polizzi also hopes to get back on the air via her own TV talk show, ""like a 'Chelsea Handler'-type show,"" she told CNN, ""late at night, when I can talk about anything, because I have no filter."" Her BFF Jenni ""JWoww"" Farley is less ambitious, setting her sights on a television career behind the scenes as a producer. While she plans to continue selling brands such as her tanning line, Farley said she wants to actually ""create something."" ""I would love to do a fun makeover show with young women and men to up their confidence,"" she said, ""and then do a show about bullying, really break down the barriers and help change the laws behind them, because it's behind the times."" Farley might actually have a shot at launching one of these shows at MTV, she noted, because she's been shadowing the network's producers and executives just as much as they've been watching her these past six seasons. ""I could go to MTV and be like, 'Hey, do you know me? I'm kind of on one of your shows, and I have an idea...'"" The strategy's also in line with the network's spinoff habit, such as how ""Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County"" led to ""The Hills"" which led to ""The City"" which led to ""Audrina"" on sister network VH1. Deena Cortese doesn't think her previous career as a dental assistant is in the cards anymore, because the show has tainted her reputation, not improved it. ""Be honest,"" she said. ""Would anybody trust me doing that anymore? Probably not."" But she thinks she has another fallback position in the real world: starting her own beauty salon. As they prepare to say goodbye to the perks of being (temporarily) famous -- ""I'm going to miss getting courtside seats to the Knicks games!"" Pauly D said -- they always have the inevitable reunion show to look forward to, because, as show creator SallyAnn Salsano said, we've never seen the real ""Jersey Shore."" ""What really happened in that house, no one knows,"" she said. ""You guys got the PG-version."" Could the fund-raiser special change the cast members' reputations? Will it help them succeed at their goals? It's too soon to tell, but at least it shows a new side of people who were about to be typecast forever.","The cast members of ""Jersey Shore"" are expanding their empires beyond the program .

This photo taken by passenger Steve Murphy early on Monday shows oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling of the Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 . A Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 superjumbo made an emergency landing in Azerbaijan on Monday due to a loss of cabin pressure, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded for 18 hours at the airport in the capital Baku. The service from London to Singapore landed safely without any injuries to the 467 passengers and 27 crew on board, a Singapore Airlines spokesman said. ‘Oxygen masks were deployed and the aircraft landed uneventfully at Baku airport,’ he told AFP by email. ‘We sincerely apologise to affected customers for the inconvenience caused by the diversion and the lengthy delay encountered at the airport in Baku,’ the airline said. Airbus said in a statement it was ‘following up on this issue and providing technical assistance to the airline’. Angry passengers took to social media to complain about being stranded in the Heydar Aliyev International Airport instead of being put up in hotels. ‘We are not going to a hotel but will be flying out tonight after an 18-hour wait around the duty-free area,’ wrote passenger Nic Coulthard on the Singapore Airlines Facebook page. ‘I don't think it is inconsistent for passengers to be grateful for a safe landing whilst disappointed at the lack of communication and facilities provided once on the ground,’ he wrote. Another passenger, Terri Mann, complained that she had to sleep on a ‘cold steel bench’ with her 17-month old child, and that there were no ‘food places’ at the airport. ‘We are all a little hesitant about getting on our next legs of our journeys, just hope the worst is over,’ she wrote. Responding to a flood of posts on Facebook, Singapore Airlines noted that noise was reported from a door during an earlier flight of the same plane. The service from London to Singapore landed safely without any injuries to the 467 passengers and 27 crew on board (file picture) ‘The door was inspected by engineers on the ground in London with no findings, and the aircraft was cleared for continued operation,’ it said. Passenger Matthew G. Johnson had said earlier that a ‘loud air noise was heard from the door five rows in front’ shortly after take-off from Heathrow Airport in London. Upon questioning, a crew member allegedly told him that the door had a ‘mild’ leaking seal, Johnson said in a Facebook posting. A few hours later oxygen masks were deployed and the aircraft began an emergency descent over Afghanistan after the cabin began losing pressure, he said. His posting was accompanied by a photograph of a dimly lit cabin with oxygen masks hanging from the ceiling.

Unrepentant: Imelda Marcos, widow of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, holds two-day-old Zian Jay Rosay during her campaign for re-election . Imelda Marcos, the widow of dictator Ferdinand Marcos known for her extravagant lifestyle and thousands of shoes, has been pressing the flesh with the people of the Philippines as she attempts to keep her seat on the country's congress. The 83-year-old was pictured holding a baby and shaking hands with her electorate at the Mothering Center, one of her health projects, in the Ilocos Norte province, in the northern Philippines yesterday. Marcos is running for re-election in the May 13 mid-term elections as congresswoman in Ilocos Norte, the home province of her late husband, where she was first elected in 2010. During her husband's reign, known for corruption, political repression and human rights violations, Imelda's extravagant lifestyle reportedly included £3million shopping trips in New York, Rome and Copenhagen and she once sent a plane to pick up Australian white sand for a new beach resort. She was especially notorious for her shoe collection, which was estimated to be around 2,700 pairs. While many of her countrymen languished in poverty, she purchased a portfolio of desirable properties in Manhattan in the 1980s, which was later seized and sold, along with many of her jewels and most of her extensive art collection. Marcos also orchestrated lavish public events using millions of dollars in public funds to laud her husband's regime and her own public image. The Marcoses fled the Philippines at the climax of the army-backed 'people power' revolt in 1986 and left behind staggering amounts of personal belongings, clothes and art objects at their palace, including at least 1,220 pairs of the former first lady's shoes. Legacy: Marcos stands beside a bust of her dictator husband, who was ousted in an uprising . Laughter: Marcos is running for re-election in the May 13 mid-term elections . Ferdinand Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in 1989 and his widow and children returned home in 1991. She continues to fight the government over her abandoned assets more than two decades after her husband’s reign ended. The Marcoses, their relatives and business cronies were accused of looting up to £6billion from state coffers and faced up to 900 cases of corruption and other charges.

When she announced her shock decision to run for election in 2010, she was pictured kissing the glass coffin of her embalmed husband and said: 'He was our best ever president. 'During his time we had territorial integrity, freedom, justice and human rights. Whatever else people may say those were the best times ever for the Philippines.' About a third of Manila’s 12 million residents live in slums, and a third of 94 million Filipinos live below the poverty line of $1.25 a day. Marcos was born in Manila. Her paternal ancestors were wealthy, powerful landowners. She married Ferdinand Marcos in 1953 and was instrumental in his rise to power. In 1966, Ferdinand Marcos became the 10th President of the Philippines In 1972 he declared martial law to preserve his hold on power. Together with Imelda, he would rule the Philippines until his removal in February 1986. His wife was appointed to numerous powerful positions in the government. In December of 1972, Carlito Dimahilig tried to stab her to death with a bolo knife during an award ceremony broadcast live on television. He was gunned down by police. The wounds on Marcos' hands and arms required 75 stitches. On February 25, 1986, Ferdinand Marcos and his family fled to Hawaii after his regime was toppled by the four-day revolution. The uprising was sparked in part by rumours that the couple were involved in the 1983 assassination of Benigno S. Aquino, Jr., Marcos' foremost political opponent.

ff1e215c678744ca4fa83163dfe386f402209738,"By . Gareth Rose . Lottery winners Chris and Colin Weir have bankrolled an astonishing 80 per cent of Yes Scotland’s fight to break up Britain, donating £2.5million to the cause in just 12 months. The full extent of the Weirs’ financial backing was laid bare yesterday when Yes Scotland finally released documents detailing the major donors for 2013/14 as the referendum date nears looms into sight. It shows that the Ayrshire couple, who won £161m in a Euromillions draw in 2011, has donated a total of £4.5m to SNP and the Yes campaign since their win - £1.5m more than had previously been estimated. Euromillions winners Chris and Colin Weir who received £161million in 2011 from the lottery draw . It means almost 80 per cent of £4.9million funding for the separation campaign has come from just one source – something the grassroots campaign Unlock Democracy warned was ‘unhealthy’. Critics said yesterday that the balance of funding was ‘unhealthy’ - and opponents Better Together claimed the figures made a mockery of Yes Scotland’s claims of diverse grass-roots support. Alexandra Runswick, director of Unlock Democracy, which campaigns for open and transparent politics, said: ‘I don’t think that’s healthy. ‘Whether it is one large donor funding a political party, or one side of a referendum, I don’t think that’s a healthy situation to be in. ‘It should not be determined by one person’s resources – you are giving one side a stronger voice than the other.’ The official referendum period, with stricter spending rules, does not start until May 30 – despite the fact that both sides have been campaigning hard for well over a year. ‘It’s absolutely right that after the Scottish referendum there should be a review of spending rules,’ Mrs Runswick said. The Weirs’ latest £2.5million pledge to Yes Scotland is their second to the pro-independence campaign, having previously donated £1million. And the couple, who scooped Scotland’s biggest ever lottery jackpot, also gave £1million to the SNP, in 2011. The couple have donated a total of £4.5m to SNP and the Yes campaign since their win - which is £1.5m more than had previously been estimated . In the new figures, Yes Scotland have also identified their other leading donors – although their contributions are dwarfed by the Weirs’. Randall Foggie, from Kirkcaldy, a lifelong Nationalist and failed SNP council candidate, donated £60,000. A further £50,000 came from Mark Shaw who, as well as being head of Hazeldene property group, is operations director at Yes Scotland. A respected businessman with a ‘no nonsense’ style, he was brought in by Yes Scotland a year ago to shore up the faltering campaign. Property developer Dan Macdonald, who is on the Yes Scotland advisory board and has previously donated to the SNP, gave £50,000. The other named donors are Norman Easton, who gave £10,000, and novelist and poet Mary McCabe, who contributed £8000. Yes Scotland said a further 11,000 people gave donations of less than £7,500, which in total came to £473,000. But Better Together said the dominance of the Weirs in the Yes Scotland balance sheets shows the campaign does not have the widespread support it claims. It means almost 80 per cent of £4.9million funding for the separation campaign, headed by Alex Salmond centre, has come from just one source . The pro-independence campaign has received almost double the £2.8million Better Together reported in December. However, if you take away the Weirs’ contribution, Better Together would have received more than £1million more. Blair McDougall, director of the pro-Union Better Together campaign, said: ‘No- one would criticise the Weirs, who are long standing SNP supporters. ‘It is extraordinary that compared to the tens of thousands of small donations received by Better Together from our supporters, almost 80 per cent of Yes Scotland’s money comes from one source. ‘We now know why they have been hiding their donations for so long. ‘Whilst Better Together relies on the support of a broad mixture of large donors and thousands of ordinary people giving what they can, it is clear that the nationalists are almost completely dependent on one source of income. The latest polls suggest one in three Scots support Salmond's bid for separation . ‘With a new poll showing just one third of Scots support leaving the UK, these donor details confirm that Yes Scotland is little more than a front for Alex Salmond’s SNP.’ Meanwhile, the Scottish Government has failed to reveal where it found the money for the £1.25million White Paper. Publishing and distributing the 649-page manifesto was funded out of taxpayers’ money - despite being full of SNP promises. The Scottish Conservatives – who branded it the ‘biggest ever taxpayer-funded work of fiction’ – have twice asked which government department had to foot the bill. However, Nicola Sturgeon, the Deputy First Minister who is also in charge of the referendum, has been unable to answer, giving another holding answer. Gavin Brown MSP, Scottish Conservative finance spokesman, said: ‘The Scottish Government has now decided to give a holding answer to a holding answer, which is something of a new phenomenon. ‘I asked a very straightforward question two months ago about what budget the White Paper expenditure came from, because from reading the Scottish Government budget, it is not at all clear. ‘Either the SNP doesn’t know where the money came from or it’s simply unwilling to say. ‘Neither of those scenarios is acceptable, and the full costs and how they were paid for must be published as a matter of urgency.’ A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: ‘The Scottish Government will respond to Mr Brown’s parliamentary question in due course. Ministers have been open and transparent regarding the costs involved.’ The Scottish Government will go into purdah on August 21 – meaning no new policies will be announced until after the referendum – but stricter rules come into force for the parties and campaigners this month. The regulated period will run for 16 weeks from May 30 and Yes Scotland and Better Together will be restricted to spending £1.5million each. The SNP will be allowed to spend £1.344million, Labour £834,000, the Tories £396,000, the Liberal Democrats £201,000, and the Greens – who support independence - £150,000. Blair Jenkins, chief executive of Yes Scotland, said: ‘We greatly appreciate and are hugely encouraged by the thousands of people across Scotland who have made donations – both large and small – according to their financial means. Mr and Mrs Weir declined to comment.","Ayrshire couple won £161million in Euromillions lottery draw in 2011 .

The violence began when protesters attacked the headquarters of the Libyan Shield brigade, demanding the militia turn over responsibility for its security operations to the military, LANA reported. Benghazi's ruling Local Council and the Libyan Interior Ministry issued separate statements calling for ""self-restraint"" and an immediate end to the bloodshed. It's been nearly two years since the overthrow of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and the new government has reinforced its military by contracting with a number of militia groups. Anger toward the militias, which are predominantly made up of former rebel fighters, has been building since Gadhafi's overthrow. It boiled over after some militias laid siege to government ministries in the capital city of Tripoli in April in an attempt to force the government to pass a law that would ban Gadhafi-era officials from holding office. Libya's government has acknowledged problems with trying to disarm arm and control a number of militias. The Libyan Shield brigade has previously said it is operating in Benghazi with the approval of the Ministry of Defense. Last year, protesters in Benghazi attacked a number of militia offices as part over the public anger that followed the attack on the U.S. Consulate that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead.

A man with severe amnesia who believes his name is David or Tony has been found sleeping on the streets, having forgotten his identity. The mystery man has told police he suffers from a disorder called dissociative fugue - a condition often connected to some form of traumatic experience which can cause loss of memory. He was brought to the attention of detectives last September after appearing to be out of place sleeping rough in Cleethorpes, Lincolnshire. Having spent four months trying to discover his identity, police now want the public to help. He believes his name is either David or Tony Thorpe and that his date of birth is October 5, 1955 - making him 58 - but a thorough search of both police and NHS systems has drawn blanks. The stranger said he thought he was from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, but was not sure and also thought he could have connections in Blackpool, Lancashire. The man is well-spoken and has a northern accent which could be from either the Yorkshire or Lincolnshire area. Authorities hope this clue could help unlock the secrets of his past. Police officers said the mystery man is not a person who sits begging on the street and that he is not wanted for any criminal offences. Humberside Police Detective Chief Inspector Paul Welton said: ‘This is very rare case in which somebody will come to an area, and have no idea who they are and if they have any family. Appeal: He was brought to the attention of detectives last year after appearing to be out of place sleeping rough . ‘We have not been able to establish how the man came to stop in north-east Lincolnshire, however we are doing all we can to help him find his family and friends. ‘The man is no longer sleeping rough and is being supported by the police and a number of agencies. He does not drink alcohol and does not take any form of drugs or medication.’ DCI Welton added: ‘This is a genuine case of somebody who really does need to the help of the public to return home to his family and his friends. ‘Anyone, who may think they can help this man find out who he is should call Humberside Police as a matter of urgency. We want to all we can to help him but we can't do that if somebody does not come forward to tell us who he is.’","Mystery man tells Lincolnshire police he suffers from dissociative fugue .

ff1ef1d452fd4ac0c64d756b4e2df83f4338723b,"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A deadly leopard stunned tourists by catching and then 'befriending' a frightened impala. The big cat seemed to shelve its predator instincts as it played and licked the young fawn. The rarely seen interaction was caught on camera by game ranger Chad Cocking, 29, in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Cuddling up: The young leopard rests its paw on an impala in Kruger National Park, in what tourists thought might be an extraordinary show of friendship between predator and prey . Friend for dinner: This leopard seems to play affectionately with an impala in Kruger National Park... but the cordial relationship didn't last long . Mr Cocking said: 'This was clearly far more of a game for the leopard than it was for the impala - but some moments could almost have been misinterpreted as bonding between the two.' Unfortunately the friendship was not to last and the leopard eventually got bored with its own game and ate the impala. The cat was well-known to rangers as a newly independent hunter named Nkateko - meaning lucky. Her mother had died from a severe infection caused by a wounded ear, which had actually been inflicted by Nkateko. Strange bedfellows: Tourists at Kruger National Park, in South Africa were amazed when predator appear to befriend prey . Where do you think you're going! The impala realises this friendship may not last and attempts to make a bid for freedom only to be firmly held in place by the hungry leopard . Mr Cocking was with safari guests when they found the young female carrying a live baby impala in her jaws. The 22-month-old leopard dropped the exhausted impala on the ground and waited for it to try and run away before pouncing on it again. It would then repeat the game. At one point the impala managed to escape by running underneath the tourists' Land Rover, where the leopard was too timid to approach. Bid for freedom: The young impala, clearly showing the injuries from its struggle with the leopard, momentarily escapes the predator's clutches . Normal service resumed: The temporary truce is brought to a violent end in front of stunned tourists as the leopard again grabbs hold of the impala . Chad, from Johannesberg, said: 'I had to make a decision. It was not my role to interfere so I decided to reverse and the leopard moved in again to reclaim her prize. 'Whenever the impala got up to run off, some of the guests would cheer it on, hoping that it would run away to safety, but the leopard was too quick and agile for this ending to ever come to fruition.' Mr Cocking said it was the first time he had seen this behaviour in his six years at the Motswari Private Game Lodge and more than 20 years visiting the area. He added: 'It was a touch sad, as it is never a pleasing experience to watch an animal suffer, but at the same time it was a truly remarkable experience to watch this rare behaviour first-hand.' In for the kill: The young leopard finally decides to carry the impala in its jaws off into the undergrowth of Kruger National Park to eat .

The Barclays Premier League champions host Sky Bet Championship side Sheffield Wednesday in the third round of the knockout competition on Sunday. It is the second time City have faced the Owls this season, having thrashed them 7-0 in the Capital One Cup in September. VIDEO Scroll down to see Pellegrini speak about the importance of the FA Cup . Manchester City are flying high in the Premier League and are challenging Chelsea for top spot . Manuel Pellegrini insists his side are focused on the FA Cup after missing out on the Capital One Cup . Now City are in even greater form having gone unbeaten in their last 12 games, winning 10 of them. Their hot sequence has seen them claw back an eight-point deficit to draw level with Chelsea in the Premier League and reach the knockout stages of the Champions League. It seems a daunting task for Wednesday but, coming soon after the draining Christmas programme, manager Manuel Pellegrini is taking nothing for granted. The Chilean said: 'It has been a difficult moment because we played three games in a week, very important games in the Premier League. 'We had to play for nine points in one week but we have finished that and now we must think about Sheffield Wednesday. 'For our team it is a very important cup. Last year we were eliminated here against Wigan but we won the Capital One Cup. 'This year we are eliminated from the Capital One so we will try to continue in the FA Cup as far as we can.'

City were knocked out of the Capital One Cup by Newcastle in October amid a poor spell that saw them win just once in six games. That brought scrutiny of Pellegrini and his methods but doubts appear to have been swept away by City's form since the November international break. It was at a similar stage last season when City began to click into top gear. Pellegrini said: 'For different reasons we had a low performance for around two weeks. 'We were not playing so bad in that moment but we made important mistakes and when you make mistakes the score is not what you want. After that, we arranged again the way we were playing. 'Important players returned to their normal performance and I am very happy with the way we are playing now.

Influential captain Vincent Kompany and strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko are the key players currently sidelined. Kompany is thought to be the closest to a return after calf and hamstring problems but has been ruled out of the Wednesday clash. Dzeko and Aguero are expected to return later in January. Midfielder Yaya Toure could face Wednesday in what would be his final appearance before joining up with Ivory Coast for the African Nations Cup. Pellegrini has hinted that second-choice goalkeeper Willy Caballero is likely to remain in the side after England number one Joe Hart was rested against Sunderland on New Year's Day. Pellegrini said: 'It is important when you play so many games - not only for Joe but for other players - to have an important rotation. 'I did the same in the Capital One for Willy Caballero.

ff21f0fe867b88914eac9063ca584963cb634fff,"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Some people just aren't hardwired for the traditional workplace. If you get bored easily, have many interests, like to take risks and prefer to make your own rules, then you may be one of them. So what's an unconventional worker like you to do? Well, you can either suffer through decades of being someone's employee, unfulfilled and bored, or you can take a risk and create your own path to success by working for yourself. Wayne Rogers, an entrepreneur, businessman and actor (famous for his roles on television series like ""M*A*S*H"" and ""House Calls"") did just that. In a career that epitomizes the word ""unconventional,"" Rogers has been involved in everything from the wine-making and bridal businesses, to acting on stage and owning a film-distribution company. In his new book ""Make Your Own Rules: A Renegade Guide to Unconventional Success,"" Rogers details how he was able to triumph in such a wide variety of business endeavors, all of which were independent pursuits. Here are some of his top tips for finding success through working independently, as discussed in his book: . 1. Don't limit yourself: Many people believe that because their educational background or work experience lends itself to a particular field, that their career choices must lay within that field. Not so, says Rogers. ""This will surprise you, but the common thread to the various businesses in which I have been involved is that I had never previously been in them."" While many would see a lack of experience as a deterrent to entering a particular business, Rogers saw it as a benefit. ""It was an advantage that I had no rules to follow, no premade decisions, no 'books' to tell me how to find success. This allowed me to take a creative approach rather than an administrative approach,"" he says. ""It is my belief that the best results in business come from a creative process, from the ability to see things differently from everyone else, and from finding answers to problems that are not bound by the phrase 'we have always done it this way.'"" 2. Get comfortable with ""red tape:"" These days, even small businesses are subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations, so if you want to start your own, these regulations should be learned and lived by. ""Your ability to comply with the blizzard of paperwork and reports required by various rules that come down from Washington, D.C., your state capital or your local zoning board may mean the difference between success and failure,"" Rogers says. 3. Remember that bigger is not better: Fight the urge to make growth and size the overarching goals of your business. ""Size is not efficient,"" Rogers says. ""Not that long ago, there were several automobile manufacturers, including Nash, Kaiser, Hudson, Studebaker and Packard. They had to compete with one another. Was it difficult? Yes, but it led to innovation."" By contrast, he says, today's Big Three automakers -- Ford, General Motors and Chrysler -- have become complacent with their products; so much so that they were overtaken by foreign competitors and forced into their respective financial crises. Keep your business small, and you keep your business innovative, he says. 4. Work with good people: Choose the people you bring into your business wisely, Rogers says. ""Pick partners and associates you trust and have them trust you. Both of these processes will almost certainly affect the outcome of what you are doing,"" he says. ""Picking whom to trust ... is based on using your instinct, observing people's behavior and judging the consequences of their actions.""

Five American military personnel were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan last night on the deadliest day for US forces so far this year. NATO officials said that initial reports suggest that there was no enemy activity in the area at the time of the crash outside Kandahar city in the south of the country and that an investigation has been launched into how it happened. Two US special forces operations personnel were shot dead in an attack by an Afghan policeman in eastern Afghanistan earlier yesterday taking the day's death toll to seven. Scroll down for video . In a separate incident Monday, U.S. forces shot at an Afghan truck, center, killing two passengers and injuring another on the road between Kabul and Bagram, Afghanistan . Major Adam Wojack, a NATO spokesman in Afghanistan, said that all five people killed in the helicopter crash had been aboard the UH-60 Black Hawk and that no one on the ground was killed. The crash is the deadliest since last August when a helicopter crashed during a firefight in a remote area of the Kandahar province which saw seven Americans and four Afghans killed. In March last year 12 Turkish soldiers and four Afghan civilians died in a helicopter crash and in 2011 30 American troops were killed when a Chinook helicopter was shot down in Wardak province. The latest deaths take the number of Americans killed in Afghanistan so far this year to 12. Last year, 297 US military service personnel were killed in the country, according to Associated Press. The earlier 'insider' attack by an Afghan policeman yesterday had taken place in Wardak province in the east of the country, according to US officials. Crash: The helicopter came down just outside Kandahar city in southern Afghanistan killing five US service personnel . The attacker is said to have stood up in a police pick up truck, grabbed a machine gun and opened fire. As well as the two US servicemen that were killed, four others were injured. The Taliban later claimed responsibility for that attack in a text message sent by spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. In a separate incident on Monday, Afghan officials said U.S. troops shot and killed two Afghan civilians as their truck was approaching an American convoy on the road between Kabul and Bagram. Six Afghan civilians were also killed in insurgent attacks yesterday according to the Interior Ministry.

The artworks were commissioned in 1985 by pioneering home computer company Commodore, who wanted Warhol to demonstrate the graphic capabilities of its new Amiga 1000 as it went head to head with Apple's popular Macintosh series. Although video footage exists of the artist creating the images alongside singer Debbie Harry at the launch of the Amiga 1000, the artworks themselves were thought lost until researchers tracked down the obsolete disks within The Warhol Archive and hired a team of experts to extract the contents. Scroll down for video . Found: One of recently discovered electronic artworks created by Andy Warhol. Created as long ago as 1985 using an Amiga computer, the works were thought to have been lost at some point in subsequent decades . Looking back: One of the files features an attempt at a full reworking of one of Warhol's most famous artworks - the iconic '32 Campbell's Soup Cans' series from 1962 . The files revealed dozens of Warhol's digital originals, ranging from abandoned doodles, to an adapted version of Sandro Botticelli's Birth Of Venus, and even full reworkings of his own most famous artworks - including the iconic Campbell's soup cans. Another of the artworks shows a sketch of Debbie Harry, which was almost certainly created during the Amiga 1000 launch. The hunt for the floppy disks began when the artist Cory Arcangel - a self-described Warhol fanatic and 'lifelong computer nerd' - stumbled on a YouTube video of the Amiga 1000 launch.

This is the actual computer and kit Warhol used to do so . After discussing the footage with figures in the U.S. art scene, Arcangel was introduced to The Andy Warhol Museum's chief archivist Matt Wrbican, who was able to track the floppy disks down. Describing the artworks, Arcangel said: 'In the images, we see a mature artist who had spent about 50 years developing a specific hand to eye coordination now suddenly grappling with the bizarre new sensation of a mouse in his palm held several inches from the screen.' 'It had to be enormously frustrating, but it also marked a huge transformation in our culture: the dawn of the era of affordable home computing.' 'We can only wonder how he would explore and exploit the technologies that are so ubiquitous today.'

A 13-year-old Washington School boy became suicidal according to his parents after his teacher allegedly bullied him and wrestled him to the floor. The unnamed teen told his parents 'I want to die. I want to kill myself.' following the incident involving John Rosi the school wrestling coach at Gig Harbor's Kopachuk Middle School. Caught on film by fellow students the alleged bullying by Rosi directly followed a 15-minute period where the boys fellow eighth-graders swung him from his arms and legs, wrote on his feet, stuck a traffic cone on his head, gagged him with his own sock and taunted him. Scroll Down for Video . The children held the teen down while they placed chairs over his head during John Rosi's class . The teenagers parents became aware of the incident which occurred in February after their son refused to go to school and became withdrawn. They complained and asked Kopachuk to make students hand over relevant video footage from their cell-phones when requested. 'I was shocked. My wife broke down crying. It was tough to see,' said Randall Kinney, the boy's father to KING5.com . The incident happened at around 9 a.m. in the morning during a class and Rosi is seen to join in with the swinging of the boy by poking him and pretending to sit on him, saying, 'I'm feeling kind of gassy.' The unnamed boy is seen here with a traffic cone on his head at the beginning of the 15-minute video shot by fellow students at Kopachuck Middle School . The children can be seen on the video incapacitating the teenager by placing chairs over his body as the draw on his feet . Then the children goaded on by John Rosie swing the boy by his legs and arms as he struggles and he can not get free . John Rosi is seen standing over the children as they stand on top of the unnamed teenager who claims he was bullied . The class that is supposed to be in session is a half hour reading and math preparation lesson conducted by Rosi. In one of the videos, a dozen students drag the teenager around the room, swing him like a hammock, rip off his socks, write on his feet, shove a sock down his mouth, hold a pillow over his face and then cover him with chairs. This continues for 15 minutes until Rosi joins in and smiles and at one point, he smiles for the cameras. Following viewings of the video, Rosi, a 14-year-veteran of the school was suspended for 10 days without pay, given training and then eventually moved to another school. According to the Tacoma News Tribune his base salary as of 2010 was $64,174, with approximately $10,000 more for coaching duties. 'Rosi is completely ignorant of the fact that he’s got a whole classroom hazing one kid,' said the boy’s father, interviewed Monday by The News Tribune. 'They classified it as roughhousing. But it’s not 14 kids wrestling each other. It’s a dozen kids using my son to demonstrate their dominance over him.' 'I was horrified by what I saw,' said acting Peninsula School District Superintendent Chuck Cuzzetto to KSDK.Com . Cuzetto said the teacher displayed 'inappropriate classroom management,' but the district decided against firing the teacher because of his 'body of work' over an 18-year teaching career in the district. John Rosi can be seen to put his foot onto the chairs that are on top of the teen . Once he has got free from the other children the boy points his finger at John Rosi who is supposed to be teaching class . John Rosi is seen (left and right) to grab hold of the smaller teenager by the arms . John Rosi eventually pushes the boy to the ground and his red hoodie can be seen at the bottom of the picture . 'It's an isolated situation in an 18-year career. That's horrific, and it deserves some pretty significant action fast. And that's what we did,' said Cuzzetto. However, after watching their child being man-handled by Rosi, the Kinney's are calling for police intervention and his firing from the school district. 'I don't think he realizes what he has done,' said Karla Kinney, the boy's mother. Pierce County sheriff’s detectives are investigating the complaint and seeking records of the school district’s investigation, said detective Lynelle Anderson, spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Office. The teen who is now 14, is attending a private school having left Kopachuk Middle school. Back in February when the incident was investigated, Rosi apologised but said that he did not 'view the incident as anything more than harmless childhood horse play and a chance for the kids to take a break from the daily grind.' His written statement to the school said that he understood that the classroom was not appropriate for horseplay and that he will view the incident as a 'learning experience.'","Teenager in Gig Harbor, Washington, was grabbed by his fellow eighth-graders, held up by his hands and legs and swung while he let out a high pitch scream .

ff22a5d481502ab952b7027aaf7f4a3cc76a6fcf,"(CNN) -- The list of defendants whose cases could be affected by the alleged drug tampering of a former Massachusetts chemist has now grown to over 40,000, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration said Tuesday. The chemist, Annie Dookhan, 34, already is facing a total of 27 counts including obstruction of justice, mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. Dookhan worked as a state chemist testing drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies from 2003 until March 2012, when she resigned, according to the Massachusetts attorney general's office. The attorney general's office began a criminal investigation in July 2012, after Massachusetts State Police were tipped off by Dookhan's co-workers who alleged her work might be unreliable. The investigation revealed that Dookhan allegedly tampered with evidence by altering substances in vials that were being tested at the state lab, allegedly to cover up the practice of routinely ""dry labbing"" samples. ""Dry labbing"" is a term used for merely visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test. Authorities arrested Dookhan at her home in Franklin, Massachusetts last September, but she was released on $10,000 cash bail with conditions, according to the state attorney general's office. Dookhan has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Former Massachusetts chemist faces even more charges . After ordering that the lab where she worked be shut down in August 2012, while the investigation was ongoing, Patrick created a special counsel to expedite the identification of individuals whose cases involved evidence potentially mishandled by Dookhan. Initially Patrick's administration estimated 34,000 defendants possibly had been affected, but that estimation rose to 37,500 after attorney David Meier joined Patrick's special counsel in September. The increase came as no surprise to Patrick's administration, because there was always an assumption that more information would lead to more discoveries, said Heather Johnson, a spokeswoman for the administration. Since January, approximately 2,500 more names have been identified, bringing the total number of individuals potentially affected to 40,323, which Meier has recorded in a ""master list."" While some of these added names are in fact new, the majority is not; rather, most are newly identified co-defendants of cases that were already on the list, Johnson said. 2012: Chemist in Boston lab scandal handled 50,000 drug samples . The ""master list"" is an inventory of names of each person whose drug samples were associated in some way with testing done by Dookhan at the drug laboratory, and it is the product of a nearly year-long review and an electronic analysis of over three million lab documents, Patrick's administration said. According to Suffolk District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Rene Algarin, 240 defendants whose cases are potentially affected have been released in Suffolk County until the investigation surrounding Dookhan's alleged evidence tampering is concluded. But the case against Dookhan is complicated by the fact that she faces indictments in seven different Massachusetts counties -- Suffolk, Plymouth, Middlesex, Norfolk, Essex, Bristol and Barnstable -- because she had previously testified in various trials in her former official capacity as a chemist. Bridget Morton Middleton, assistant district attorney for Plymouth County, said it's not just simply coming up with a list of names of defendants. It's a much more labor-intensive process that each of the seven counties must undergo to determine whether a defendant's sentence should be put on hold. In some cases, for instance, Dookhan was not the primary chemist in a trial and was only agreeing with what another chemist had confirmed, Middleton said. At a news conference Tuesday afternoon, Meier said he plans to sit down with representatives from the bar associations, district attorneys, prosecutors and chief justices of the various courts to present the material he has gathered. Meier, however, made it clear several times that it is not -- and was never -- his role to assess these documents, but rather to ""get the information into the hands of the appropriate people, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and judges, so that fundamental fairness and justice can be done in the court rooms."" Dookhan's attorney, Nicholas Gordon, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Dookhan's next court date is set for October 11 in Suffolk Superior Court .","Annie Dookhan was a state chemist in Massachusetts for nine years .

ff22c3641efcf6ac56788fad9a9353cd4f7a7df4,"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes his rejuvenated squad could yet hunt down Chelsea and Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League title race to emulate the class of 1997/1998. The Gunners - who earlier this week completed the signing of Brazilian defender Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal - host out-of-form Aston Villa on Sunday looking to record a fifth win in the last six league matches which would see them move back within striking distance of the top four. With Chelsea and Manchester City drawing 1-1 at Stamford Bridge in Saturday's late kick-off, the Gunners are now 14 points off the pace. Mesut Ozil scored in Arsenal's last game against Aston Villa, a 3-0 win in September . Tomas Rosicky shone in Arsenal's 3-2 win against Brighton and will look repeat his display on Sunday . Aaron Ramsey inspired Arsenal to an important three points over Manchester City two weeks ago . It is a similar scenario to that faced in the 1997/98 campaign, Wenger's first full season in charge. Arsenal trailed United by some 12 points at the end of February before embarking on a nine-match winning streak which saw them go on to lift a first title in seven years and then complete the double with victory over Newcastle in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Given the likes of Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil, who both scored in the FA Cup fourth-round win at Brighton, are fighting fight, and with Jack Wilshere also around a month away, Wenger feels the ability is there to put together the needed run of results. He said: 'It (to challenge for the title) is our target, but we have to be realistic. What we want is to win every game we can, but at the moment we are 14 points behind Chelsea, they need to lose five games, and they have lost only two until now. 'What we want to do is focus on our performances and show that we can produce consistent results. After, where we will finish, it is difficult to say.'

Robert Pires (left) talks with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (right) during training . Wenger added: 'Yes, it is true that I have some real selection dilemmas. 'We have got three players out (on loan) - (Yaya) Sanogo, (Lukas) Podolski and (Joel) Campbell - so you imagine before the number of offensive players we have. 'Now we have a good squad, compact, but of quality and with the competition it will be very hard.' Gabriel is expected to go straight into the squad against Villa. Wenger is confident the 24-year-old can follow in the tradition of Brazilian's having a positive impact on the club. 'We were lucky as we also had Gilberto and Edu, who is from Sao Paulo, and so it Sylvinho. We were very lucky with the Brazilians, they are top-level class people,' he said. 'Football is a big meaning for them, they have the hunger and the love for football, it is in their country and it is a religion.'

Jack Wilshere catches his breath as he continues his comeback from injury in Arsenal training . Wenger is now the longest-serving manager in the English Premier League. The 65-year-old is often a sounding board for issues within the game, and reflected on the recent developments in the FIFA presidential campaign. Whomever is eventually chosen, Wenger feels continuing to improve the game in emerging nations is paramount to progress. 'You would say to keep developing the game in Asia and to structure the game in Africa and as well to give better education to young people and young players,' Wenger said. 'I believe there is a great job to do at FIFA and you look at some continents with great potential and not enough players come out. In some continents football has become hugely popular to watch and the next target is to develop football in there. 'It is difficult to imagine that China has 1.4billion and they do not find 11 good players, or maybe there are too many and you don't find the right one.' Wenger, though, is not about to follow the likes of former Portugal midfielder Luis Figo into football politics. He said: 'I have great experience on the technical front, but after that, on the administration front, I am a bit limited in my experience and I am not really interested in a lot of hand shaking.'","Arsenal are fifth in the league and 14 points behind leaders Chelsea .

The rider is reclined inside the vehicle, which has a complex series of gears to reach maximum speed . The shell is made of carbon fibre . Standard bike wheels and tyres are used. The rider will also rely on a video camera to see, as the cockpit is entirely enclosed. 'Our mission at AeroVelo is to inspire creativity in the public and challenge the norms of conventional design by doing more with less,' the team, led by Cameron Robertson & Todd Reichert, said. It has previously created human powered helicopters and planes. 'Each year we recruit a student-based team to tackle a high-profile, thought-provoking engineering project. 'This year we will break the human-powered speed record at 133.8 km/h (83.1mph) by building the world's most efficient bike, Eta.' The bike will, they claim reach speeds similar to a car.

Bluenose, an early version of the design, at Battle Mountain, Nevada, where it reached speeds of 78MPH (125 Km/h). 'It all comes down to efficiency, which is actually the reason that the bike is called Eta. 'Eta is the Greek letter often used in engineering as the symbol for efficiency.' The team have spends months on the design, reducing or eliminating the forces that are resisting our forward motion. 'By streamlining the body (ie. making a smooth contour with no massively separating turbulent vortices) we can reduce the aerodynamic forces by about 20 times,' they say. 'Our team is deep into detailed design and prototyping, and will have the vehicle ready for the World Human-Powered Speed Challenge (WHPSC) in Battle Mountain, Nevada this September,' they say. 'Beyond challenging the world record, we calculate that our incremental improvements in aerodynamics, mechanical efficiency, and rolling resistance will make it possible to achieve speeds in excess of 140 km/h (87 mph).' The firm is using off the shelf components where possible. 'Wherever possible we've prioritized mature technologies and used novel design and better optimization/analysis to achieve the desired performance gains. 'We have budgeted an extensive portion of our timeline for testing - to shake down the design, work out the bugs, and be ready to break the world record.' Backers can go to Kickstarter to help fund the project, which is aiming to raise $30,000.

One person dead, two others missing. That's the harsh reality police, firefighters and residents were dealing with Saturday in Manitou Springs, a mountain community of about 5,000 people just west of Colorado Springs, after sudden, raging waters tore through the area. Under mostly sunny skies, crews spent the day looking for the missing and combing through wreckage wrought by floods triggered by intense rain. Locals such as Justin Blount, meanwhile, tried to make sense of what happened. He was in a Manitou Springs cafe, working on its owner's computer, on Friday when water suddenly, perilously started flowing in front of the building. He and others -- one of them wheelchair-bound -- heard the water rushing below them as they finally got in an elevator and crept up to safety. ""It was like a raging river, a black river coming down,"" Blount told CNN affiliate KUSA, dry after his 2Â½ hour ordeal the day earlier. ""... It was wild. I'm still in a little bit of shock."" His central Colorado town, at the foot of Pikes Peak, was one of several nationwide that have been impacted by wet weather and floodwaters in recent days. Showers and thunderstorms were expected from the Pacific Northwest to the Deep South. In addition to a pocket of Colorado, flash-flood warnings were in effect Saturday for parts of Washington and Oregon, as well as much of New Mexico. There were flood warnings -- which are issued when water levels in rivers and other waterways rise to precarious levels -- in Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri and South Carolina. Some communities bracing for wet weather were coping with the aftermath of earlier devastating floods. A flash flood watch was in effect through 9 p.m. (11 p.m. ET) in Manitou Springs, for instance, given the threat that could be caused by more heavy rains. The dangers there are exacerbated by last year's mammoth Waldo Canyon wildfire, which -- as Lt. Steve Schopper of the Manitou Springs Fire Department explained -- made the soil saturated, unstable, ""kind of waxy"" and little help in curbing rushing waters. ""It's like liquid cement,"" Schopper told KUSA, noting that those caught up in the rocks, trees and other debris have little chance to escape. ""... You're not swimming out of this. It will rip your clothes off."" Video of the mudslide showed cars sliding swiftly down an incline while others remained stranded in rushing, gray-colored water. One man was found dead beneath ""significant amounts of debris"" left on Colorado Highway 24, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office said. The search, meanwhile, continued for two others. In Oklahoma, floodwaters swept away and killed a man who was trying to save his daughter from a stranded vehicle early Friday. Vincent Brown was attempting to rescue his daughter who had become stranded in high water in her vehicle, Oklahoma City Police spokeswoman Sgt. Jennifer Wardlow said. Wardlow said Brown's daughter was wading toward her father. She turned to retrieve some items in her vehicle, and when she turned back around, he had been swept away by fast-moving floodwater that had rapidly appeared in Oklahoma City overnight. In South Carolina, Logan Dale Evans was found dead in floodwater on his family property Wednesday night near the town of Central, Pickens County Coroner Kandy Kelley said. Evans, 23, was found outside his vehicle, which ended up about a mile downstream, said Kelley, who added that Evans is believed to have drowned. At least two people were reported killed in Missouri this week, including a driver who was caught in rapidly rising water in McDonald County on Thursday, said Gregg Sweeten, the county's emergency management director. The woman, thought to be in her 60s, had been trying to drive over a bridge when the water overwhelmed her vehicle, Sweeten said. On Monday, Elijah Lee, 4, died after 6 inches of rain fell on Pulaski County, about 140 miles southwest of St. Louis. The boy was found in a vehicle swept up in floodwater that caught the community along Mitchell Creek off guard, said Sgt. Dan Crain, a Missouri Highway Patrol spokesman.

David Cameron is being urged to help thousands of badly wounded British veterans who are being forced to use their war pensions to pay for social care. Under the rules, veterans injured on or before April 5, 2005, must hand over most of their weekly injury compensation payments should they require social care. By contrast, service personnel wounded after that date are entitled to keep all their payments because they are paid out of a different Government scheme. Now the Royal British Legion, backed by many MPs, is calling on the Prime Minister to correct this anomaly, which penalises veterans of the Second World War, the Falklands War, Northern Ireland and both Gulf Wars. Last night, Sir Bob Russell MP, a member of the Commons’ Defence Select Committee, said: ‘It’s an absurdity that some veterans should be discriminated against in this way. So I will be asking the Prime Minister for an explanation as to who drew up this dividing line and on what basis this date was chosen.’ Veterans injured in service on or before April 5, 2005, receive a War Disablement Pension and are known as War Pensioners. Those who have social care needs routinely find councils take all but £10 per week of their compensation to cover their care costs. This is despite the fact that a veteran with a similar injury who was wounded after the cut-off date is able to keep all of their compensation. This is because councils are instructed to fully exempt payments made under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme (AFCS) from any means testing for social care. Former submariner Keith Clarke, 43, a paraplegic, is forced to give £100 per week to meet the costs of his social care, which includes daily visits by a care worker.

Normandy veteran Fred Cannon, 90, who suffered gunshot wounds in 1944, apparently has ‘very little money left over’ after his council has taken his pension to pay for nursing home fees. Since 2005, some 16,000 injured troops have been paid almost £341 million in compensation from the AFCS scheme. A Royal British Legion spokesman said: ‘Military compensation is awarded as a recompense for pain, suffering and loss of amenity experienced by injured service personnel and veterans. ‘It should not be treated as normal income.

An Amish woman and her brothers cut the hair of her parents in Ohio to help them get to heaven the woman has claimed while taking the stand at the trial of 16 breakaway Amish members. The woman told jurors overseeing the hate crimes trial that her siblings had been worried that their parents were drifting away from their religion. She says they piled into a van and drove two hours last October to take her father's hair and beard as well as her mother's hair to help them. Taking the stand: Amish women are seen leaving the U.S. Federal Courthouse on Tuesday, two days before a jury heard testimony by one who claims they cut off her parents' hair after the couple strayed from their religion . Prosecutors say what happened in five hair-cuttings in eastern Ohio last fall amounted to hate crimes because they were motivated solely by religious disagreements. The government says the suspects targeted the hair and beards of Amish people because of its spiritual significance in the faith. The claims came amid further testimony that intensified when a woman took the stand to accuse an Amish bishop of forcing women in their settlement to have sex with him. The allegations against Samuel Mullet Sr, also accused of orchestrating the hair-cutting attacks, say he forced married women to have sex with him so he could turn them into better wives, one of the women testified. Crimes: Prosecutors say the five hair-cuttings of men's beards and women's hair in eastern Ohio last fall were hate crimes because they were motivated solely by religious disagreements . The woman said what started out as hugs turned into kisses and then sex. She said she resisted at first. 'He would say things like `I can't understand why you won't obey me, the other ladies can,'' the woman testified. 'I always gave up. I was afraid not to.' Prosecutors say the alleged sexual 'counseling' of married women shows the control Mullet had over followers at the Amish settlement he founded two decades ago. The 16 people accused of carrying out the hair-cutting attacks last fall all lived on Mullet's settlement in eastern Ohio near the West Virginia panhandle. The government contends that the hair cutting was motivated by a religious dispute between Mullet and other Amish bishops who had sought to limit his authority. Those accused of planning and taking part targeted the hair and beards of the Amish because of its spiritual significance in the faith, prosecutors said. Arrests: These five men, along with reputed Amish breakaway sect leader Sam Mullet and Emanuel Shrock, were arrested by the FBI and local sheriff's deputies last fall on federal hate crime charges . Mullet has denied any involvement. Sexual force: A woman testified that Samuel Mullet Sr, pictured, accused of orchestrating the hair-cutting attacks, forced married women to have sex with him so he could turn them into better wives . His defense attorneys had tried before the trial began to bar any testimony about the alleged sexual 'counseling.' They argued that there was no proof of such sexual conduct and that mentioning it would be highly prejudicial. U.S. District Court Judge Dan Aaron Polster told jurors after the woman took the stand that Mullet was not charged with any sex crimes and that they could only consider the testimony as it relates to charges in the indictment. The woman said her husband had a mental breakdown in the summer of 2008 and was in the hospital when Mullet suggested that her husband's trouble stemmed from dissatisfaction with his marriage. Mullet told her he wanted to help the couple with marriage counseling, and she agreed to his request to move in with him, she said. At first, he wanted hugs, from her she said, adding that she learned he had asked the same of other women. 'Next we had to kiss him or maybe we had to sit on his lap,' she said. 'I'm not sure what was first.' Even . asking for a hug was a startling request, she said, in a community that . values modesty and is deeply religious. Amish women in the most . conservative churches traditionally wear long dresses, bonnets over . their hair and frown upon drawing attention to themselves. She went along with Mullet's wishes because she thought it would help her husband, she said. Refusal: After refusing Mullet's sexual advances, the woman testifying said that she moved her family out of the Amish settlement and to Pennsylvania (Lancaster County pictured) One evening after moving into Mullet's home, another woman came to her and said that he wanted to see her in his bedroom, she said. She said she refused, but Mullet was insistent. The woman said she moved out of the house after about two months when her husband returned to the settlement, but she continued to see Mullet at his home. 'I was afraid not to go,' she said. The woman said she finally told Mullet a month later that it had to stop. He called her a whore, she said. The woman and her husband soon left the Amish settlement where they had raised their children and moved to Pennsylvania. We just took our children and a few suitcases with our clothes,' she said.","One of 16 Amish members on trial claims she and her siblings cut her parents' hair because they were drifting away from their religion .

ff2432cbdae90e3fdfc4a349777e284d9fa0c949,"(CNN) -- With presents to buy and families to visit, the holiday season can become an endless to-do list. But take some of that vacation time to explore the holiday spirit in action. At these five wonderlands around the country and the world, you'll find the wonder of winter, the wonder of shopping and the wonder of Santa Claus up close. White River National Forest, Minturn, Colorado . This year, the White River National Forest is known for two things. It's the most visited recreational forest in the country, a hub of skiing aficionados, thanks to nearby Aspen and Vail, and it's also the home of the 2012 U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree. Since 1970, the Capitol Architect has partnered with a different National Forest to choose a new tree for the Capitol lawn. This year it was White River. ""This was the first time that White River's ever had the privilege of providing it, so it was a big deal for us,"" said Bill Kight, a Forest Service spokesman. The Capitol Tree tours the country during the holiday season before making its way back to Washington -- and it offers visitors a chance to see a piece of the White River National Forest on the move. Those who see the forest itself should expect a different experience than in the warmer months, according to Aurora Palmer, who works in public affairs and sustainable operations at the park. During the winter season, the major attractions include skiing, snowmobiling and sledding, as well as other icy sports. The park even gives out permits for those looking to cut down their own Capitol Tree. ""Fantasy of Lights,"" Callaway Gardens, Pine Mountain, Georgia . Callaway Gardens' ""Fantasy of Lights"" is entering its 21st year. The resort hasn't added a new scene to the massive lights display since 2000. And yet it has lost none of its holiday power. ""It's amazing to see the faces of the people as they come through the gates, and they leave, and they make those Christmas memories,"" said Callaway Gardens spokeswoman Rachel Crumbley. The Georgia resort draws guests year-round. But ""Fantasy of Lights"" -- which includes 8 million lights in 15 seasonal scenes, making it one of the largest displays nationwide -- is special, Crumbley said, drawing both couples and families. ""It's just on such a grand scale,"" Crumbley said. ""And with the music combined with the lights combined with the themes, I think it kind of resonates."" Lake Placid, New York . Lake Placid and the surrounding Adirondack Mountains see the majority of visitors between May and October, but that doesn't mean that the area is lacking when the weather gets colder. Thanks to its proximity to the mountains, Lake Placid offers ""just what the Adirondacks offer,"" said Kim Rielly, spokeswoman at the Lake Placid Convention and Visitors Bureau. That means a variety of outdoor recreation, in a park that stretches across 6 million acres. That's equal to 6 million football fields, she said, although she says that's a conservative estimate. In the last 100 years, Lake Placid has hosted the Winter Olympic Games twice, and it remains a destination for the athletic. Still, Rielly called Lake Placid a ""cool little alpine village in the middle of the wilderness."" At the center of town is an old ski jump, while the surrounding wilderness of the Adirondacks holds multiple museums for exploring and 43 peaks for hiking. One of them, Whiteface Mountain, is paved all the way to the top, so that families can visit the peak by car. And from December 7-9, Lake Placid will host a ""Holiday Village Stroll,"" featuring workshops, holiday story time, a ""Jingle Bell Run"" and more. Mall of America, Bloomington, Minnesota . The Mall of America remains a destination for any holiday shopper, if only because of its size, featuring more than 500 shops. But this year, the mall is adding to its seasonal appeal with the unveiling of the ""HGTV Holiday House,"" a life-size gingerbread house. Guests can explore the space, which will feature demonstrations, meet-and-greets and regular appearances from HGTV's stable of home dÃ©cor and design personalities. Beyond that, the mall is also hosting a Holiday Music Festival; and its multi-floor shopping selection, complete with an amusement park and larger-than-life Lego installations, dwarfs any other shopping experience as an indoor travel option. Santa Claus Village, Rovaniemi, Finland . Last on the list is a wonderland across the globe, ""the official home of Santa Claus,"" at Rovaniemi in Finland. It's not just a title: one of the town's main attractions is the Santa Claus Village. At the heart of the village is the Santa Claus Chamber, where Santa lives, ready to greet visitors. One of the village's biggest draws is the Santa Claus Main Post Office, said Sanna Kortelainen, managing director for Rovaniemi Tourism & Marketing. ""The Santa Claus Main Post Office is a real post office, which operates 365 days in the year,"" she said. ""That is the place where all the letters to Santa are sent. The letters are opened by post elves and read through."" After that, guests can ride a sleigh or visit the reindeer farm or even explore the Arctic Circle, which begins at the edge of Rovaniemi. The Christmas season is also the best time of year to visit, Kortelainen said. The season begins with a declaration from Santa on November 24 and goes into January, ending when the sun again begins to rise above the horizon.","White River National Forest in Colorado is the most visited forest in the country .

ff245cc2f964938183ec35faa17f36875909b6f1,"AUSTIN, Texas (CNN) -- CD sales are down. Digital hasn't caught up. Record companies are consolidating. New bands are trying to find their own way. Baltimore-based DJ Blaqstarr, best known for his work with M.I.A., performs at SXSW. Despite all the challenging news, thousands of industry professionals and eager music fans turned out for the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas, over the weekend. The festival, tailored to recording industry talent seekers and the talent they seek, officially ended Sunday. While optimism ran high at the five-day whirlwind of panel discussions, trade shows, live concerts and private parties, much of the conversation throughout the event focused on the sobering reality of the music industry's uncertain future. ""Obviously we're going through a transition. All of the major record labels have gone through some sort of cost-cutting and consolidation over the last few years,"" said Rand Hoffman, head of business and legal affairs at Interscope Geffen A&M Records. ""Right now CD sales are falling more rapidly than digital is going up,"" he told a group of SXSW festival-goers at a panel discussion on the future of the industry. According to a release from Nielson SoundScan, which tracks record sales, over a billion songs were downloaded in 2008, an online music industry record. But the success of the individual digital song sales on popular sites such as iTunes has not replaced the lost revenue from the declining number of CD sales. Total album sales fell 14 percent in 2008, which accounts for a huge portion of record company profits. Sony Music Entertainment's Julie Swidler noted that despite the stressed state of affairs for the corporate music industry, the major labels will stay relevant, but probably as smaller versions of their past selves. ""We'll still be major, just smaller major,"" predicted Swidler, who works as the executive vice president of business affairs and general counsel. The growing trend of established artists selling and distributing their music without the aid of a major label paints an even bleaker picture for the corporate music business. ""The bottom line is if we want to continue, we have to break future superstars, and the only way to do that is artist development,"" Swidler said. Both Swidler and Hoffman see light at the end of the tunnel, however.  Watch sights and sounds of SXSW » . Hoffman acknowledged that the major labels must find a way to turn the digital sales momentum into a greater profit and predicts that the United States will eventually have a terrestrial radio performance right law, which would require radio stations to pay artists each time they play their songs. ""I can't believe that if almost every single ... Western country in the world has [a performance right], that the U.S. will go on indefinitely not having this. There's no rational basis for it. Its just politics."" And Swidler believes that the labels can adapt to the online music movement with new, creative ways of directly connecting the artist to the consumer. ""I think you're going to see online where suddenly instead of buying an album by your favorite artist, you'll buy a year's subscription to that artist,"" Swidler says. ""So it's almost as if an artist will trickle out a story for you for the entire year."" Good turnout, but not everyone is happy . If the turnout at SXSW 2009 is any indication of consumers' willingness to spend money on music, then record label executives have reason to be hopeful. The festival brought in an estimated $103 million to the Austin-area economy in 2008, and though this year's numbers have yet to be tabulated, SXSW representatives expect the amount will be on par with last year. Almost 2,000 artists played SXSW this year, which is about a hundred more than last year. An impressive list of major recording artists brought their high-profile acts to the intimate Austin stages. Kanye West, Jane's Addiction, Big Boi and Metallica all played unannounced shows, primarily to exclusive crowds of industry insiders who heard about the concerts through word of mouth,  though news of Metallica's set at the release party of ""Guitar Hero: Metallica"" on Friday was well-known around town early that morning.  Watch some of Metallica's performance » . In addition to the surprise appearances, SXSW showcased scheduled performers PJ Harvey, the Indigo Girls, Ben Harper, Third Eye Blind and droves of other hit groups, almost all of whom garnered huge crowds of enthusiastic and devoted fans. Not everyone was pleased with the festival's exclusive nature, however. To many locals, the perception is that major music acts are stealing the thunder from unsigned, local artists who are trying to attract as many label representatives to their shows as possible. Austin-based band the Vincents played a slew of gigs throughout the week and received positive feedback from the people who attended their shows, many of whom purchased their CD. But they ultimately felt overshadowed by the swarms of industry types who were constantly rushing to the next secret show or exclusive party. Local find . In spite of a few complaints from Austin residents, SXSW can provide an amazing opportunity for a lucky few whose acts get picked up by industry folks. The ""feel good"" story of SXSW 2009 might have been local, buzz-worthy band The Black and White Years, which recently took home five Austin Music Awards, including best new band, song of the year and best producer, the latter for former Talking Heads keyboardist-guitarist Jerry Harrison. Harrison stumbled across The Black and White Years at a small performance at SXSW in 2007. He liked their sound and decided to produce their debut album. ""People think when you play these South by Southwest things that nothing ever happens. Sometimes it does. You've got to be skilled at your instrument, but it takes a little luck. You just never know, it might happen,"" said drummer Billy Potts. Though dominated by music, SXSW also features a robust film festival and an innovative interactive gala, where techies from around the country showcase their latest software, gadgets and gaming technology. This year the film festival had 57 world premieres, 133 features and 127 short films screened, many of which fulfill SXSW's primary role of providing a platform for indie films and documentaries. Whereas the big studio movies have seen a boost in sales during the recession, the economic crisis has crippled many foundations that provide the funds for independent documentaries. Indeed, New York's Tribeca Film Festival announced last week that it would be making cuts to its line-up because of economic conditions. But producer Erin Essenmacher, whose film ""Mine"" premiered at SXSW and took home the documentary audience award, remains confident about the entertainment industry's future. ""I hate to say things are recession-proof because I don't even know what that means anymore, but there's always going to be a need for content, whether it's on the Web or on TV,"" she said. ""And as the economy gets worse, I think people want that outlet.""","SXSW is major music and film festival in Austin, Texas .

ff25408d258803ac1031d3becb80cb20cd2fea09,"Fans of Gary Glitter (pictured outside Southwark Crown Court where he was convicted of sexual offences) expressed support of singer in Amazon reviews . Amazon is still carrying glowing reviews of Gary Glitter CDs, with fans describing the paedophile as 'not a vile monster' despite his numerous convictions for sexual offences against children. Among products for sale on the website are the artist's Greatest Hits album, with 23 customers rating the CD with five stars, the highest possible review on the site. Most made reference to his chequered criminal past but said it had 'nothing to do' with his abilities or success as a musician. One fan even cast doubt over his convictions, writing: 'He would have been massive in America before his ""crimes"" came to light'. The 70-year-old was found guilty of sexual attacks at Southwark Crown Court this month, his youngest victim an eight-year-old girl. It was the latest in a string of convictions relating to indecency and children, having been jailed for three years over separate incidents in 2006 and tried in court in 1997 after police found child pornography on his computer. Among the most supportive comments is one written by a fan calling himself 'R N Smith'. It reads: 'Gary glitter is a genius and should have been more popular than Elvis, I believe he would have been massive in America before his “crimes” came to light. 'I personally could listen to his music every day and I very often do. 'I don't believe for one minute that he is this vile monster everyone paints him to be, most of you claim to know so much about what he has supposed to have done and yet hardly anything has ever been published regarding his crimes.' Another said they felt sympathy for the paedophile who they had grown up listening to. 'I am so upset for this guy - yes I know he has gone to places people don’t wish to speak of. 'But I grew up in the Seventies and I thought him the Sweet, Mud, Slade, T rex - Suza Q, Showaddywaddy, etc were great send up fun. 'Do you remember when it was the thing to go to Glasgow and watch the New year GG show ? well I do and went a few times too..... a great night out - what a deep shame... coz it was very very good.' Among reviews for the singer's many CDs are some which dismiss his convictions for sexual assaulting children . Among comments of support for the musician were others describing him as a 'lowlife'. Many fans acknowledged his convictions but said they should be kept separate from his body of work. Amazon has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment on the matter. Earlier this month Glitter was found guilty of a string of sexual assaults on children as young as eight. It comes after the paedophile was first found guilty of possessing child pornography in 1997. After being sentenced to four months imprisonment he fled the UK. After settling in Cambodia, in 2002 he was deported to Vietnam having been accused of the rape of a child. Three years later he was arrested trying to board a flight to Thailand. Six girls and women, aged 11 to 23, came forward to say they had had sex with the musician. Following his conviction of offences this month he was remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on February 27. Glitter was arrested in Vietnam in 2006 over the sexual assault of children. Last month he was convicted of more offences in London . The singer was previously convicted of possessing child pornography. Above, he addresses the media at a 2000 press conference over other alleged assaults .","Dozens of reviews remain under singer's Greatest Hits album on the site .

ff256ef7c4dfe69ba9d8c7125371de4b058bcaa3,"(CNN) -- A line of fast-moving storms and possible tornadoes stretching from the Gulf Coast states to Illinois left at least six people dead Friday and caused widespread damage to homes and businesses, as forecasters warned of more potentially severe weather. Three people died in the small northwestern Arkansas town of Cincinnati, which reported power outages after the strong storm went through, said Ann Upton, Washington County's emergency management deputy. Two additional fatalities occurred in Dent County, Missouri, according to Salem police spokeswoman Wanda Suhr. While a sixth storm-related death happened at a home just north of Rolla, Missouri, about 106 miles southwest of St. Louis, said Phelps County Emergency Management spokeswoman Sandy North. The storm injured residents and destroyed some 25 homes in Phelps County after it earlier left more than a dozen people hospitalized in northwestern Arkansas, medical officials said. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon declared a state of emergency. ""We have three confirmed deaths today. We have some other people with some significant injuries and that's why I declared a state of emergency. Our state emergency management folks are up and operating to assist the locals and provide whatever support is necessary,"" he told CNN. The governor, who is expected to tour the affected areas Saturday, said officials are still working to access the damage. In Arkansas, Washington Regional Medical Center spokeswoman Terry Fox said several people were also reported trapped under fallen debris in the storm's immediate aftermath in Benton County. Six homes and four chicken production facilities were destroyed, while five homes suffered moderate to heavy damage, said Matt Garrity, Benton County's manager of emergency services. A fire station, three buildings and one store were also damaged, said Garrity, and an airport that serves northwestern Arkansas was closed due to debris in the area. ""We are in part of tornado alley,"" he said. ""So even a small storm does a lot of damage."" Emergency crews are currently surveying the extent of the damage and ""making sure that no one is trapped,"" he said. In Mississippi, a storm system knocked out power to nearly 20,000 homes in the central part of the state, said Mara Hartman, a spokeswoman for Entergy Corporation. Elsewhere, the fast-moving storm caused injuries and damage in Pulaski and Laclede counties in Missouri, knocking out power at Fort Leonard Wood, a U.S. Army post that took a direct hit from a suspected tornado, accordingto Laclede County Emergency Management spokesman Gail Teter. Four people at the base were treated for minor injuries after the storm hit, the army said. The tornado cut through several miles from the training areas into where families live. The series of storms that moved through Oklahoma and into northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri have reached speeds of 40 mph and passed through more populated areas in St. Louis, Missouri, and the surrounding municipalities. Search and rescue workers were deployed to assess the storm's damage in St. Louis County, where there were reports of injuries, according to Mark Diedrich, the county's emergency management acting director. CNN affiliate KMOV on Friday broadcast images of heavy damage -- including destroyed homes and overturned vehicles -- in Sunset Hills, Missouri, approximately 15 miles southwest of St. Louis. ""It's causing havoc,"" said Sunset Hills police spokeswoman Donna Palasky. The storm also left heavy structural damage to buildings in its wake -- including a popular shopping center and Catholic church -- in the town of Fenton, some 18 miles southwest of St. Louis, said Fenton Deputy Fire Chief Jeff Heidbreder. Emergency crews are surveying the damage, he said, but there were no reports of injuries. In the nearby town of Ballwin, police spokeman Jim Heldmann said the storm caused heavy damage to homes and buildings, but no injuries were reported at this time. The Arkansas Department of Emergency Management issued a tornado advisory as bad weather lingered in the state, instructing residents to seek shelter in their home's interior rooms or on its lowest floor. ""When a tornado is sighted, the most important rule is to get low and stay low,"" the statement said. The threat of severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes will continue through Friday evening across the Mississippi Valley and Tennessee Valley states, according to Greg Carbin, meteorologist for the National Weather Service. CNN's Mark Bixler, Reynolds Wolf, Tom Laabs, Erica Henry, Aaron Cooper and Shelby Erdman contributed to this report.","Missouri governor declares a state of emergency following storms .

ff259a862809b6744def2dd07fc018428c671635,"(CNN) -- A possible workers strike at Belmont Park racetrack on Long Island, New York, could rein in I'll Have Another's chance at the coveted Triple Crown title on Saturday. More than 80 of the racetrack's maintenance workers and starters have threatened to go on strike in the days leading up to the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown. The workers, who take care of the grounds and racetrack at Belmont in addition to putting the horses in the gate, have been embroiled in a contract dispute with the New York Racing Association over wages and employee contributions to health care costs since 2010, said Vincent McElroen, financial secretary of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 3 union. The union voted to authorize a strike more than a week ago, he said. ""They're trying to get a message to the employer that this is serious stuff,"" McElroen added. Racing association officials issued a statement calling UBEW Local 3's potential strike ""extremely self-serving,"" alleging that the union is using ""the attention and excitement of a Triple Crown attempt to further its own agenda."" I'll Have Another -- the 3-year-old colt who claimed victory in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes this year -- would be the first horse to take the Triple Crown in 34 years. Since 1990, only seven horses have won the first two legs of the title. Racetrack officials are expecting a crowd of more than 100,000 for Saturday's race. McElroen said the timing of the potential strike has nothing to do with the Belmont Stakes. ""We've been negotiating for 24 months,"" he said. ""We've gotten nowhere, and the workers are fed up."" Part of the dispute revolves around the definition of the workweek. In their former contract, which ended after a year-long extension in early 2011, UBEW workers were paid overtime on weekends, McElroen said. But in 2012, the racing association changed the workweek to reflect Belmont's Wednesday through Sunday race schedule, eliminating weekend overtime pay. ""This change resulted in a drastic reduction in their take-home pay,"" McElroen said. UBEW workers at Belmont have also had to start paying into their health insurance benefits and are no longer given retiree medical benefits, he added. In the statement, New York Racing Association officials responded that ""Local 3 is unwilling to pay a reasonable share of the cost to provide these benefits and they refuse to work with us to create shifts that reflect the reality of how a race track operates."" McElroen would not comment on the likelihood of a strike this weekend but said that the union ""is not one to frivolously go out on strike."" ""(The New York Racing Association) took the position that it's our way or the highway when they implemented these unilateral changes,"" he said. ""The workers are not going to accept that.""","80 racetrack workers have threatened to go on strike .

ff267187f5e71fbeea8ce3adf08c7374120c2212,"By . Amanda Jones . and Emma Innes . Amanda Jones, 71, lost her 33-year-old daughter, Rebecca James, to breast cancer 11 years ago. Since then Mrs Jones has been tirelessly campaigning to raise awareness of the disease. She regularly visits prisons and other women’s institutions to educate people about the signs of breast cancer. Mrs Jones, from Camberley, in Surrey, has also raised more than £200,000 for Breakthrough Breast Cancer. Now, as Mothers’ Day approaches, the retired radiographer pays tribute to her daughter. Amanda Jones (left) lost her daughter, Rebecca James (right) to breast cancer when Rebecca was 33 . ‘Happy Mummy's Day! This is my best card of a horse EVER for you!’ Small, round, auburn haired,  little red wellies on her feet and my riding hat jammed on her head, my youngest child, Rebecca - Becs - competed noisily with her elder sister and brother in the giving of cards and receiving of cuddles. It would be the same picture being enacted all over the country on that special day - and every Mother’s Day since - precious memories of love and laughter. Becs was born, two weeks late, on June 7, 1969. I'd spent some time in hospital during the pregnancy, due to a threatened miscarriage, so she arrived with determination to get on with life, against the odds. And that's how her character continued to develop - always holding her own with her siblings, Camilla and Dominic, while they made a formidable, loyal and loving trio. She made her way through nursery, primary and secondary schools, making great friends while not overdoing the academic side of life! Mrs James found a lump in her breast when she was just 32 and was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had surgery to remove the lump as well as chemotherapy but the cancer returned and spread to her liver . Mrs James (left) died just 11 months after her initial breast cancer diagnosis. She is pictured with her mother, Amanda Jones, and sister, Camilla . She played first the violin, and then the French horn. She was in the school orchestra and she indulged the dramatic side of her nature in the annual musical - she was always an entertainer, fun-loving, outgoing and simply so loving. Rather reluctantly, she went off to college, in the same city where Camilla and Dominic were studying, and it was much later that I heard about the rescues of Becs that the two of them had carried out, retrieving her from less than salubrious situations and returning her to her rooms. Her social life definitely took precedence over her studies! Source: Breakthrough Breast Cancer . After a year at college, she went off to . France to spend the summer working for Canvas Holidays and there the . course of her life changed. She went to a camp site outside Nice for the season, with the intention of returning in October. But, as the date approached, she spoke more and more about the son of the campsite owners, with whom she'd been working all summer. And that was how, at 19, she found her soul mate, Christian, and France became her home. We, the family, spent so much time with them throughout the years - weeks of such joy, in the sunshine of the south of France, where her auburn hair turned golden and she became our Rayon de Soleil, our Golden Girl. Just after her 32nd birthday, she rang to say she'd found a lump in her breast and was having it removed the next day. Christian phoned, so distressed, from the hospital to say it was cancer and we went over at once to be with them both. When I look back on that fateful call now, I remember all the hope and optimism and determination they both showed, giving us the example we so needed. Becs received the very best treatment from that day on from specialists who would never give up THEIR hope for her. During her first course of chemotherapy, a further lump was found in her breast and then she had a mastectomy, something that the surgeons had hoped not to have to perform on someone so young and so beautiful. Since her daughter's death, Mrs Jones has campaigned to raise awareness of the signs of breast cancer. She is pictured (left) with her children - Camilla (centre), Rebecca (second from right) and Dominic (right) - and her daughter-in-law, Joanna . Mrs Jones said: 'I saw my darling daughter draw on reserves of courage and strength that, to us, were superhuman.' Her children (including Rebecca, right) are pictured the last time Rebecca was able to go outside . On New Year's Eve, 2002, we were all in the mountains above Nice, Becs with no hair, dancing on the table and so full of joie de vivre, so full of courage and optimism. In March of 2003, it was found that Becs had developed secondaries in her liver. From then on, I saw my darling daughter draw on reserves of courage and strength that, to us, were superhuman. She never stopped thinking of others, even when so exhausted. The love that she and Christian had for each other, 14 years after they first met, had such an effect on us all through those last few weeks. On May 27, 2003, just eleven months after she was diagnosed with breast cancer and at the age of 33, Becs died peacefully, with Christian and all the family beside her. It was such a privilege to be with her at that moment. Mrs Jones (pictured with her three children) wrote: 'I know that she is with us all forever, inspiring US to live life to the full and giving us HER courage when we tire and HER laughter when tears are too close' As I had brought her into the world, so I was with her as she left her all too short life, leaving me with the gift of unconditional love that she gave me and the inspiration of her courage. She left so much undying love for her sister and brother and, for us all, the memories of her living life to the full, from the moment she and I shared her birth through her years with us, so full of love, fun and laughter. I miss her desperately every single day, I hear her voice saying ‘Hi, it's me’ on the phone, I see her swimming with Christian in the warm Mediterranean waters and I know that she is with us all forever, inspiring US to live life to the full and giving us HER courage when we tire and HER laughter when tears are too close. On Mother’s Day, I shall think, as always, how endlessly blessed I am to have three deeply loved, amazing, supportive children, even though the youngest of them is now just out of reach, ‘just down the road’, as Becs used to say, but whose presence fills my heart every moment.

ff268c9c6e0d28ad5111e6050839f9ef55ec539a,"Former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's abrupt fall from grace has taken many in political circles in Iran by surprise, further widening the gap between an increasingly insular and narrow hard-line elite and the rest of the country. It reinforces a trend towards the consolidation of power around Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his acolytes, which has been taking place for the better part of a decade, and perhaps the real surprise is the fact is that there remain members of the elite who did not think this remorseless process would ultimately apply to them. Ever since the political catastrophe of 2009, when millions pored onto the streets to protest what was widely considered to be a highly fraudulent election process, the regime has been keen to encourage the public to put the past behind them and to look forward to these elections as a cathartic exercise during which political blemishes could be washed away. Rafsanjani's dramatic last-minute entrance into the race, was seen by many as proof that some lessons had indeed been learnt. But if Rafsanjani was to galvanize the public, then his platform had to be radical and his boast that he had come to ""save the nation"" and effectively ""reboot"" the Islamic Republic, was certainly bold. However, the fact that he claimed that he had to ask permission to run, was indicative of how far the political realities of Iran had changed since he had last been president (1989-1997). No sooner had he registered than the bitter personal attacks came from the hard-liners; while others questioned just what the nature of the agreement with Khamenei had been, if any. Amanpour explains: Iran's presidential election . But perhaps most galling was that for all the hype and excitement generated by his supporters, the public appeared unmoved. Popular momentum might have developed, though the task would have been considerably harder than 2009 given the absence of a political infrastructure of street activists, (largely dismantled since 2009), and above all the sheer cynicism of the voting public. Public apathy combined with the conceit of the new ruling class, to deliver a particularly brutal humiliation to Rafsanjani, barred apparently not for his political views, but for the rather less dignified reason that the members of the Guardian Council thought Rafsanjani too old to be able to bear the burden of office. Rafsanjani's dramatic entrance and precipitous fall has shone a light on the growing fractures within elite politics in Iran. To date Khamenei has been able to blame divisions on Ahmadinejad and his ""deviant current"" on the one hand, and the foreign inspired sedition of Mir-Hussein Musavi and Mehdi Karrubi (still under house arrest) on the other. Few expected Ahmadinejad's protégé, Esfandyar Rahim Mashaie, to survive the vetting process -- other that is, than Ahmadinejad, for whom being on the ""outside"" must be an uncomfortable experience. Similarly, if slightly more realistically, few of Rafsanjani's supporters considered him vulnerable. He remained after all a pillar of the establishment, even if two of his children had been hounded into jail and he had effectively been ostracized over the past four years for his tentative support of the Green Movement. Read more: How the U.S. should respond to Iran's election . It says much of the ""wishful thinking"" that remains prevalent, that they thought this a political virtue. Firm in the belief that the Islamic Republic faced an existential threat, they had retained their faith in the integrity of a system that has long since transformed beyond recognition into a sacred autocracy. Indeed the unpredictability of the Iranian political system is not a reflection of its inherent 'democracy', but of the absence of the rule of law and the growing identification of power in the person of Khamenei. Both the Guardian Council's ""rulings"" (which it should be stressed are neither published nor explained) and the fact they can be overturned on the whims of the Supreme Leader, are indicative of this harsh reality. What we are left with is a tightly controlled ""election"" with a dry and uninteresting field. Of the eight ratified candidates, one is a nonentity, (Mohammad Gharazi); two are ostensible ""moderates"" lacking in charisma and therefore non-threatening, (Hassan Rouhani and Mohammad Reza Aref); one is an independent Principle-ist (Mohsen Rezaei) who likes to speak his mind but on past performance is unlikely to garner votes (real or imagined); while the remaining four are self proclaimed acolytes of the Leader. Of these four, two have been highlighted as the probable annointees: Saeed Jalili, the current head of the National Security Council, and Mohammad Ghalibaf, the mayor of Tehran. Jalili is widely assumed to be the favorite and his web presence is suitably polished and indicative of considerable preparation, though quite who the audience for this is, given the current restrictions on internet access in the run-up to the election, remains unclear. Jalili is perhaps closest ideologically to the Supreme Leader. For this particular puritan, the crisis Iran faces is not existential, it is an opportunity to be seized and a trial to be welcomed. Ghalibaf, who once fancied himself as Iran's answer to Tom Cruise, has had his popular credibility bruised by the sudden release of a recording of a speech he allegedly gave to members of the Basij militia bragging about how much he enjoyed getting on his motorbike and thumping students. Ghalibaf has vigorously dismissed the recording as a malicious smear, but it says much about current politics that there are many who find it credible. The real question of course is the source of the leak; and herein perhaps lies the real significance of recent developments. In 2009, the regime lost the people; it now appears to be in the process of divesting itself of its traditional elite. How the newly disenfranchised react will be interesting to watch. This may be the real legacy of the ""election"" of 2013.","Iranian regime is keen to encourage the public to put the past behind them, Ali Ansari writes .

ff26bfdfc5a01e9ed823f5449aabc268f53f7c15,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- If a kewpie doll sang in a band and had two kids, she'd be Gwen Stefani. Gwen Stefani was ready to get back with No Doubt after two solo albums and an active home life. The pop star and style icon turns 40 this fall, but she still uses words like ""you know"" and ""like"" at least five times a minute. That's part of Stefani's charm, and her carefree teenybopper mentality is one of the many reasons fans are excited about her first tour with No Doubt in half a decade. It's been 14 years since the quartet busted out of Orange County, California, with its signature sound of sunny, ska-influenced pop. In 2004, No Doubt went on hiatus as Stefani launched the first of two successful solo albums. In the meantime, drummer Adrian Young and guitarist Tom Dumont worked on side projects and watched their families grow. Stefani and her husband -- former Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale -- welcomed two sons, while bassist Tony Kanal is the only member to remain single and child-free. No Doubt is currently in the midst of a 53-date North American tour, for which they've dusted off such classic hits as ""Just a Girl,"" ""Spiderwebs"" and ""Bathwater."" Each member now travels in their own individual tour bus -- a must for an entourage that includes kids, toys and nannies.  Watch No Doubt in concert, at rest » . CNN: You'd hear rumors every once in a while that you guys were breaking up, or had broken up. Were those annoying, or did you kind of roll your eyes and say, ""That's part of the game?"" Adrian Young: I think we expected it. And there might even be some people that will think that we broke up, and that this is a reunion tour -- and it's just not the truth. We went 17 straight years without stopping, and we started having families, and we were burnt and we needed to do our own thing for a while. CNN: What was it like to get all four of you together in a room again? Tom Dumont: It's kind of like an old glove. It just fits. Young: Like an O.J. glove? Dumont: No, no, no. I know it's a weird analogy, but in the sense of -- you know, it fits. Tony Kanal: You know when somebody says ""glove"" now, you immediately think of O.J. Young: ""If it fits, you must acquit."" That's our band motto now. Dumont: We're not going to quit. We're just great old friends. It's almost like we're brothers and sister, and it's great to be having fun together again. Young: I feel more like we're married. CNN: I hear it's a little bit different this time. Instead of sharing a tour bus, you'll each have your own individual buses. Kanal: This will be our first time on separate buses, only out of necessity. Everyone's bringing their family. CNN: Are you just trying to get away from the kids, is that what you're saying, Tony?! Kanal: No, no, no! I would love to be on the bus with them. Gwen Stefani: Tony's going to be making kids on his bus. Kanal: Yeah, maybe my girlfriend and I will be in the process of starting our family. Stefani, Young and CNN (in unison): Really?! Kanal (ignoring everybody's reaction): But by default, I'm putting a studio on my bus. Because I don't have a crib on my bus -- they have cribs on their buses -- I'm putting a studio on my bus so we can keep writing if the inspiration comes, and we feel like doing it. Stefani: We're just putting the studio out there so we can pretend we might go out there and write songs, but we're really just going to have fun. ... We like writing songs, as well [but] I have to tell you, it's a very tortured process. There is nothing more rewarding when you know you've written a hit, and you know this magic happened. CNN: Did you guys really go to group therapy? Kanal: No. ... We had some self-imposed therapy sessions where we were trying to write music, and we were sitting in the room together, and a lot of stuff came out, and you know, it was kind of an emotional venting. We got rid of a lot of stuff. It was good. Stefani: We spent a lot of time together in the last 12 months. Right when I came off tour (from her second solo album, ""The Sweet Escape""), we started to write, and I was pregnant (with her second son, Zuma), and we did a lot of eating, a lot of chatting -- and then we had this magic 15 minutes from 4:45 to 5 o'clock where music would actually come out for a minute. One day, I was like, ""Argh! I'm in this room still! Let's go on tour!"" And everyone was like, ""OK!"" It was very spontaneous, and it's all kind of geared towards getting out there ... and getting inspired, and hopefully coming out of the other side and making an album. CNN: Gwen, when you were off doing the two solo albums, did you feel guilty at all? Because I know you all were trying to get back together for a couple of years. Stefani: I'm one of those people that I have to follow the inspiration when it strikes. ... These guys are just very supportive. We've been together forever -- forever, forever -- since we were kids, and this is just the one time in our lives we've had a break from each other. Everybody did their own thing. And I think all of us doing our own thing makes us even more grateful for each other, and kind of definitely not taking each other for granted -- not that we ever did before. ... But it's even more intense right now. CNN: Things have changed since the last time No Doubt was on the road, and there a lot of people who don't have that disposable income to spend on tickets for concerts. Young: One of the things we did for this tour for some of the venues is we have $10 lawn tickets for people that maybe want to come to the show, but they're strapped -- and we've never done that before as No Doubt, and it feels really good to do that. CNN: I was calling this a reunion. Was that bad? Stefani: We don't really care. We're just so happy that people want to come out and see the show, whatever they want to call it. We're just happy that people still are even talking about it. ... Even if you didn't really like our songs, or you had this kind of idea about us, come see us live, and we'll slap you around. You might have some fun, you know.","No Doubt is back together -- but don't call it a reunion .

Lying on her hospital bed, Roona Begum almost looks likes any other two-year-old. But her appearance today is a drastic transformation to how the toddler looked just a few months ago after her head swelled to twice its size. These dramatic series of images chart her journey which has seen her undergo numerous operations on her skull. Doctors carried out her latest reconstructive surgery on Friday and the results are clear to see in these pictures taken of Roona at a hospital in New Delhi, India, on Christmas Day. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . CHRISTMAS DAY: Two-year-old Roona Begum is pictured in her hospital bed in New Delhi, India, after her latest reconstructive surgery . Doctors at the Fortis Memorial Research Institute removed bone from Roona's skull in her latest operation on Friday . Life saving operations: Roona, pictured with her mother Fatima Begum, will still have a larger than average head but she will be able to live a normal life . Roona's father, Abdul Rahman, said: 'We are happy. She is much better now. There was a time when she was unrecognisable.' Roona, who lives with her impoverished . parents in a village in India's remote northeast, was born with . hydrocephalus, a potentially fatal condition that causes cerebrospinal . fluid to build up on the brain. Her condition caused her head to swell . to a circumference of 94 centimetres (37 inches), putting pressure on . her brain and making it impossible for her to sit upright. Images showing Roona's plight attracted international sympathy which prompted the Fortis Memorial Research Institute in New Delhi to treat her rare condition for free.

Roona was born with hydrocephalus, a potentially fatal condition that causes cerebrospinal fluid to build up on the brain . Rahman, who works as a labourer earning around Â£2 a day, said: 'We are very poor. We were not in a position to arrange for all the treatment. But so many people came forward to help.' Roona was admitted to the hospital in April and underwent several rounds of surgery in May and June when doctors drained excess fluid from her head and dramatically reduced the size of her skull to 58 centimetres. She spent 105 days in total at the hospital before being discharged in August. But she returned to the same hospital earlier this month to have part of her bone removed from her skull which was then rebuilt. NOVEMBER: Roona pictured in before her bone corrective surgery at Fortis Memorial Hospital  last month . JUNE: Doctors reshape Roona's skull after water on her brain which caused her skull to balloon - called hydrocephalus - had been drained leaving her disfigured . 'When she came in first, her condition was very critical. We were not sure if she would make it. But, she has responded very well to the treatment,' Dr Sandeep Vaishya, Director of Neurosurgery at Fortis, said in November. 'She still has an unusual skull size, but she is healthy. She is doing well.' Roona will likely have to undergo another procedure early next month to compress her head further. Although Roona's skull is likely to remain large, she has a good chance of developing normally, provided her neck muscles can grow strong enough to support her head, doctors have said.

ff2952da5223178a5509315b984c976b46667e44,"(CNN) -- A Florida father who beat his 11-year-old son's alleged molester unconscious before calling 911 told a CNN affiliate that his son is a hero and that the youngster is the only reason the man is alive. ""My immediate feeling was to kill him, so he will never hurt anyone again,"" the father told CNN affiliate WESH. The father, who CNN is not identifying, told Volusia County emergency dispatch Friday that 18-year-old Raymond Frolander was close to the family and was in the apartment while the father was out. When he got home, the father said, he saw Frolander with the boy. Frolander's pants fell down to his ankles ""and nothing else needed to be said"" when he saw exposed genitals, the dad said. Frolander, who is being held in Volusia County Jail without bond, faces a charge of sexual battery of a child. The father told WESH that Frolander is lucky that's all he is facing. ""My son saved Raymond. Raymond was motionless on our floor. I went to the kitchen to grab a butcher knife, and my son stopped me. My son came in front of me and saved his attacker's life,"" said the father. According to the charging affidavit, the 11-year-old victim told authorities that Frolander had performed oral sex on him and instructed the boy to fondle him. The document says the boy told authorities that Frolander began abusing him a few years ago. It also says Frolander told police, ""I'm guilty."" An official in the criminal division of the Volusia County Clerk's Office told CNN this is a confidential case because of the age of the victim, so no public record of the suspect's plea or attorney's name is available. On the 911 call, the father explained that Frolander was breathing, but not speaking, ""in a puddle of blood"" on the floor. He added, ""I loved him up until 15 minutes ago."" At times, the dad is heard talking to the suspect, at one point saying, ""You are damn lucky, boy, that I love my God."" The father has not been charged, and when CNN affiliate CFN 13 asked Daytona Beach Police Chief Michael Chitwood whether he had any issue with the father's reaction, he responded Friday, ""Not as a police chief and not as a father."" Chitwood had a starkly different reaction this week to news that the father had published his son's photo on the Internet with a plea for cash. After the boy's assault and his attacker's beating became national news, the father reportedly posted the photo on Facebook saying he needed $1 million to pay for the boy's care after the assault. He also set up a GoFundMe page, which Chitwood derided as a ""disaster."" As of Tuesday morning, the GoFundMe link on the Facebook page directed visitors to a page asking for help saving a mother of four from being evicted. GoFundMe said in a statement that its privacy policy prevented it from divulging whether a user's page had gone live, but Chitwood confirmed he had seen it. ""My detectives and I went and looked at it. It was requesting 1 million dollars,"" he said. ""It's out of control. Somebody's thinking 'We're going to cash in on this.' I didn't get it."" Chitwood also expressed concern that the victim could suffer additional psychological stress as a result of his dad's actions. ""He's a parent. He has to do what he thinks is right, but from a law enforcement perspective, we go through great lengths to protect identity of sex assault victims. There are psychological problems that come from being a victim. To put the kid out there is a disaster,"" he said. ""I've been doing this 27 years. I've never seen anything like this.""","Father says that his son stopped him from killing alleged molester with knife .

ff297eaef90c06e6285b9391068b8904901cb9ea,"Former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Thursday that the president and his administration should reconsider putting a temporary moratorium on travel into the U.S. from West Africa. 'I think substantive actions need to be taken, and they may involve flight restrictions, they may involve moving all patients to specific hospitals in the country that can handle Ebola, and I think those would be wise decisions to make,' Carney, now a CNN contributor, said today. The former Obama flack noted that he's not 'an expert' on the issue before saying a more aggressive approach 'would demonstrate a level of seriousness in response to this that is merited at this point.' However, President Obama addressed the issue directly this evening when he said he had no 'philosophical objection' to an travel ban, but that he thought it would do more harm than good. Former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said today that his former boss should reconsider putting a temporary moratorium on flights coming into the U.S. from Ebola hot spots . After holding a meeting on the health crisis, the president spoke to reporters and said 'a flat-out travel ban is not the way to go.' The president has ordered that heightened screening measures be put in place at the international airports where 94 percent of people coming countries afflicted with Ebola enter into the U.S. ‘Now, if we were to put in place a travel ban or a visa ban, it would provide a direct incentive for individuals seeking to travel to the United States to go underground and to seek to evade this screening and to not be candid about their travel history in order to enter the country,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said at an afternoon briefing. President Obama said Thursday that he has no 'philosophical objection' to a travel ban, but that he thinks it would do more harm than good . 'And that means it would be much harder for us keep tabs on these individuals and make sure that they get the screening that's needed to protect them and to protect more importantly the American public,’ he added. ‘And again, it's a relatively small number, about 150 a day that enter this country.’ It's also important to the administration, Earnest said, to keep this line of transportation open because commercial transportation 'is critical' to making sure supplies, equipment and personnel are able to enter the region. Earnest said as a 'practical matter' a travel ban would make it 'harder for the international community to respond to this incident' because commercial airlines don't want to fly people and items to West Africa just to fly empty planes, with no passengers or cargo, back. Probed by Fox News' Ed Henry for the White House's thoughts on Carney's suggestion that the administration needs to approach the Ebola outbreak with a higher level of seriousness than it has in the past, Earnest argued that the president and his team's response to the third Ebola diagnosis yesterday 'indicates that that we're deadly serious about this.' 'We're dealing with a deadly disease, and what you are seeing is the kind of tenacious response that the American people are countin' on,' he told Henry. As far as designating certain hospitals to serve as Ebola treatment centers, Earnest said that was a decision for the CDC. However, he revealed that it's something 'that CDC is examining right now.' Rep. Tim Murphy, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, questions top U.S. health officials about the Ebola outbreak on Capitol Hill today. Murphy endorsed a travel ban and charged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure' White House spokesman Josh Earnest was blitzed with questions about the Obama administration's handling of the Ebola crisis today. The Obama administration official said again today that the president would not slap travel restrictions on commercial travel from West Africa to the U.S. At least 42 members of Congress, including House Speaker John Boehner, have called on the president to halt flights coming out of West Africa. More than two dozen of them signed a letter last week begging the president to budge. At an emergency congressional hearing on the Ebola crisis today in Washington, D.C., Ohio Rep. Tim Murphy alleged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure.' 'Yet the administration continues to advance a contradictory reason for this failed policy that frankly doesn’t make sense, especially if ""priority one"" is to contain the spread of Ebola and protect public health,' he said at a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing. Murphy, the chairman of the subcommittee, estimated that roughly 1,000 people coming from Ebola stricken countries are arriving in the U.S. each week. Any one of them could be an Ebola carrier, he suggested. John P. Wagner, the acting assistant commissioner for the Office of Field Operations at the Customs and Border Protection agency assured members of Congress today that 'there are no flights coming to the United States from the affected areas.' He admitted that 'there's hundreds of flights a day coming from Europe,' however, including flights that connect in Europe with airliners flying out of area's with high rates of Ebola cases. CDC Director Thomas Frieden explained that 'many of the people coming to the U.S. from Africa are American citizens.' 'People travel, and people will be coming in,' he explained. Friden wouldn't say whether or not his agency had discussed a travel ban with the White House, whie indicating that the CDC would be open to the idea. The CDC does not have the ability to restrict flights or visas, though he said. 'At CDC, our authority is to quarantine individuals or require the isolation of individuals.' Friden directed members of Congress to the White House for further questions on the possibility of new travel restraints. At today's hearing Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan questioned the wisdom of the White House's claims that it won't put a travel ban in place because of how hard it would be send equipment and personnel to West Africa in that scenario. 'Surely we can find other ways to get the aid workers and supplies in to these countries,' he said. 'From terrorist watch lists to quarantines, there are tools used to manage air travel to assure public safety. Why not here? 'We can no longer be reacting to each day’s crisis. We need to be aggressive and finally get ahead of this outbreak.' Upton said the administration needs a better plan to treat people who are sick and 'to stop the spread of this disease here at home and at its source in Africa.' 'This includes travel restrictions from that region beginning today.'","'I think substantive actions need to be taken, and they may involve flight restrictions,' former Obama spokesman Jay Carney said today .

ff29991ec49024b125ebfd2aa9033b659089f52a,"If you’ve suffered from a blocked nose and sinus pain, the chances are that you’ll have reached for a decongestant. But you may not know how the remedy relieves the annoying symptoms. Now, a chemistry teacher from Bournemouth has created an infographic to explain just how the medicine, which typically comes in spray or tablet form, stops the nose from running. Chemistry Andy Brunning created an infographic (pictured) to explain how decongestants work. They targetalpha-adrenergic receptors in the nose and sinuses to constrict blood vessels, which helps to reduce inflammation and the formation of mucus . Andy Brunning explained in a post on his blog, Compound Interest that decongestants work by targeting alpha-adrenergic receptors in the nose and sinuses to constrict blood vessels, which helps to reduce inflammation and the formation of mucus. While a number of drugs can be used to create the effect, some of the most common are pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline - which can also be used to treat nosebleeds - phenylephrine and xylometazoline. Pseudoephedrine, a natural compound found in plants, is one of the most effective decongestants and is produced on a large scale by using a mixture of yeast, dextrose – grape sugar - and benzaldehyde, which is a colourless liquid with many industrial uses. As well as acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors, pseudoephedrine also targets other receptors, which relax muscles in the airways to ease congestion. Research has shown that man flu isn't a myth, because a lack of female sex hormones actually leaves males with weaker immune systems. Scientists from Harvard University said in October that a lack of oestrogen makes men more likely to succumb to pneumonia and other respiratory diseases. Their study, published in medical journal Life Sciences tested the effect of bacterial pneumonia on mice by introducing the infection to their lungs. Professor Lester Kobzik, of the university's School of Public Health, found females were naturally more resistant to the condition. Their increased resistance was linked to the enzyme nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) - activated by the release of the female sex hormone oestrogen. By administering a simple dose of oestrogen to both males and females, they were able to cure both of serious lung infections - clearing the bacteria from their lungs far more rapidly than normal mice. The team hopes that, in the future, this knowledge could be used to enhance resistance to common and serious lung infections and prevent flu developing into more serious pneumonia. Professor Kobzik said: 'Ultimately, this work could be especially useful in reducing risk of secondary bacterial pneumonias during seasonal or pandemic influenza. 'We were quite pleased that the work led us to NOS3-targeting drugs that are already available and that can indeed improve resistance to pneumonia in our mouse model.' As well as acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors, pseudoephedrine also targets other receptors, which relax smooth muscle in the airways to ease congestion (illustrated in this stock image) But using the decongestant for too long can backfire . While pseudoephedrine is an ingredient in may over-the-counter medicines, there are other active ingredients. Phenylephrine is one such alternative, but a handful of studies have claimed it is no more effective in easing nasal congestion than a placebo. Xylometazoline, on the other hand, is on the World Health Organisation’s list of essential medicines, but isn’t advised for people with high blood pressure. Oxymetazoline can also be used in the treatment of nosebleeds and eye redness. While nasal decongestants may be effective in relieving the symptoms of a cold in the short term, they can only be used for a limited amount of time. ‘For the most part, use of nasal sprays for more than a few days can induce rhinitis medicamentosa, more commonly referred to as rebound congestion,’ Mr Brunning writes. Scientists are unsure exactly why this happens, but it means that people who overuse their nasal sprays can trigger a vicious circle of mucus. ‘More of the decongestant is taken to alleviate the congestion, and the rebound congestion continues,’ he explained. It seems that the problem of rebound congestion can be avoided by taking tablets instead.","Chemistry Andy Brunning created his inforgraphic to detail the different chemical types of decongestants .

ff29c5ac9c015364d50bf24feed0d6d874b34bbd,"(CNN) -- Five purported Amish splinter group members, who are suspected in a string of hair-cutting attacks on Amish men and women in their community, are scheduled to be back in court Wednesday morning for arraignment, said the sheriff of Jefferson County, Ohio. Four separate incidents are being investigated in the eastern Ohio counties of Jefferson, Holmes, Carroll and Trumbull, said Frank Abdalla, the Jefferson County sheriff. Officials report the first assault happened on September 6. The last attack was on October 4, just days before three of the five suspects were arrested. The men are accused of breaking into multiple homes and holding the victims down before using scissors or battery operated clippers to forcibly cut off women's hair and men's beards. Lester Mullet, 26, Johnny Mullet, 38, and Levi Miller, 53, were arrested last Friday in Jefferson County, Abdalla said. Daniel Mullet and Eli Miller turned themselves in to Holmes County authorities a few days later. All five men are charged with kidnapping and burglary. They were released on $50,000 bond, which was paid by Bishop Sam Mullet, who, according to Abdalla, is the leader of an extreme Amish splinter group. Three of the suspects are Mullet's sons; a third is his nephew. Abdalla is not the only one who believes Mullet may be behind the attacks. ""This renegade leader is like a cult,"" said Donald Kraybill, an Amish scholar at Elizabethtown College. ""He (Mullet) masquerades under the Amish name, using religion as a way to create a kind of barrier between him and law enforcement."" ""Nothing moves in this (particular) Amish community unless (Bishop Mullet) says it moves,"" Abdalla said. According to the sheriff, Mullet instigated the attacks after being ""shunned from his faith some years ago."" ""His behavior contradicts all the standard Amish expectation for behavior,"" Kraybill said. The assaults are considered a particularly egregious offense in the Amish society, and can be considered an attack on the Amish identity. ""It's very shameful,"" said Kraybill. As a symbol of adulthood, Amish men typically grow beards after they get married and Amish women do not cut their hair, said Kraybill. The practices are based on biblical teachings, Kraybill said. ""I don't know of any other cases like this,"" said Kraybill. ""Amish-on-Amish violence is very rare."" Kraybill also pointed out that it's not correct to call the attacks Amish-on-Amish violence because Mullet is not recognized by the mainstream group. Both Holmes and Jefferson counties have large Amish populations. It is rare for the deeply private religious group to involve outsiders in their internal and religious problems. But Kraybill said when it becomes serious or involves some kind of violence, they will turn to outside agencies for help. This ""is a difficult, terrible crime,"" Abdalla said. ""We are doing everything we can do.""","The five Amish men face kidnapping and burglary charges .
The suspects belong to an extremist splinter group, local sheriff says .

Russian Liberal Democratic Party MP Valery Seleznev, left, wants to create a state allowance for men who have children with different women . He wants to extend a system which allows Russian women to claim special 'maternity capital allowances' of around £6,500 when they have more than one child. The money - he did not specify the sum - could be used to help buy a flat or for education. He said: 'Some men have several children from different women, each of whom is not eligible for the 'maternity capital programme, as some of them have only one child, and others can be married to another man. 'Often such men do not have enough money to pay for their children.

Kevin Kuranyi and Jan Moravek scored in the second half to put Schalke a point above third-placed Bayern Munich, who earlier crushed lowly Bochum 5-1 to cap a memorable week. Former Germany striker Kuranyi put Schalke ahead two minutes after halftime and midfielder Moravek ensured Bremen's first league defeat since the opening day of the season with his 72nd-minute goal. Bremen could also have closed to within a point of Leverkusen, who were held 2-2 at bottom club Hertha Berlin on Friday night, but ended the night two points adrift of Bayern. Louis Van Gaal's Bayern, runners-up to Wolfsburg last season, briefly reached their highest league position since he took over as coach in the summer as Mario Gomez continued his recent scoring run with the opening goal at Bochum and strike partner Ivica Olic netted twice. Bayern, who crushed Italian giants Juventus 4-1 in midweek to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League, moved to within two points of leaders Bayer Leverkusen, . Olic set up Gomez's 23rd-minute header for the opening goal, and Mergim Mavraj put through his own net 10 minutes later as the Germany international tried to repay the favor to the Croatian. Olic got on the scoresheet two minutes before halftime from Bastian Schweinsteiger's cross and made it 4-0 four minutes after the break with a header from Holger Badstuber's delivery. Danijel Pranjic extended the lead five minutes later after fullback Phillip Lahm surged into the box and squared the ball to him, while Christian Fuchs scored a consolation free-kick for Bochum in the 76th minute. Fifth-placed Hamburg joined Bremen on 28 points, winning 4-0 at Nuremberg to end a run of seven games without a win. All the goals came in the second half as Eljero Elia's 47th-minute strike opened the floodgates, and he helped set up Marcell Jansen for the second on the hour mark. Tunay Torun made it 3-0 six minutes later with a fierce rising effort after cutting in from the left, and Elia wrapped it up on 74 from Jansen's pass. Sixth-placed Hoffenheim failed to keep pace with the teams above them, drawing 1-1 at home to Eintracht Frankfurt, and have now won just once in five league outings. Sejad Salihovic opened the scoring for the hosts in the ninth minute with a penalty after Selim Teber fouled Vedad Ibisevic, but Pirmin Schwegler equalized for Frankfurt on 61 when his long-range effort hit Luis Gustavo and ballooned over goalkeeper Timo Hildebrand and into the net. Borussia Moenchengladbach triumphed 5-3 at home to Hannover, who conceded three own-goals and had a player sent off in an incredible mid-table clash. Defender Karim Haggui twice put into his own net -- the first an lucky rebound from goalkeeper Florian Fromlowitz's attempted clearance in the 15th minute to open the scoring, and he also contributed the game's eighth goal with his second faux-pas. Constant Djakpa also conceded at the wrong end to give the hosts a 3-1 lead in the 59th minute, while Hannover's Didier Ya Konen scored in each half before being dismissed for his second yellow card on 84. Cologne edged away from the relegation zone with a 0-0 draw at Freiburg as Germany international striker Lukas Podolski -- who has not scored in the Bundesliga since September 13 -- hit the woodwork twice for the visitors.","Schalke move to within a point of German Bundesliga leaders Bayer Leverkusen .

Nasser’s . photograph appears to show around 15 homemade IEDs packed inside metal . containers hidden behind what looks like a garage door. His . Twitter profile also contains a photograph showing the chain-like . weapon thought to have been taken from an enemy Shia Muslim – and a plan . to behead the captive fighter. The accompanying message says: ‘Look . what we found on this shi’i, glad tidings we’ll make sure his head is . detachable.’ Nasser describes himself as a ‘soldier of the Islamic State . of Iraq and Sham [ISIS]’ on the social networking site. His profile . explains his beliefs are based on ‘a book that guides and a sword that . supports it’. Yesterday, his devastated father Ahmed Muthana said: ‘This is not the son I know. Maybe if they have a heart they’ll come back. ‘What . they are doing or posting online, they are being told to by the people . with the guns who feed them, look after them and have control over them. They are trapped in the situation and that makes it hard for them to . come back or leave the place. Interview: The BBC have traced Aseel Muthana to Syria, where he has internet access, and he raved about jihad and also revelled in 'glad tidings' when an enemy was beheaded . Cardiff link: Reyaad Khan and Aseel's brother Nasser Muthana appear in this Isis recruitment video encouraging others to fight jihad . ‘I think they are being forced into posting these things because my kids are not like this.’ The 57-year-old added: ‘I haven’t had any contact with either of my sons since they left. ‘I don’t want to speak to them. If they want to speak to me they can reach me but I’m not going to ask them to speak.’ Another of Mr Muthana’s four sons, Aseel, also spoke of his devotion to the ISIS cause. In . an online conversation with the makers of a BBC Wales documentary . broadcast last night, he claimed there were ‘loads’ of other men from . Britain who have joined the group. Asked whether he realised he would be . arrested if he returned to the UK, he replied: ‘Yes, most probably’, . adding: ‘Jihad is obligatory.’ Quizzed about any regrets he had over . leaving Britain, he said: ‘Nope, I can say I am willing to die but Allah . knows the truth.’ Aseel . described making friends with other British jihadists who had travelled . to Syria to join ISIS. He told the Week In Week Out documentary that . when his brother Naseer left home his family was devastated. School days: Third British jihadist Reyaad Khan having fun with friends in Cardiff before he fled to fight . Asked . to defend the brutal methods used by ISIS, he said simply: ‘If the . state (ISIS) uses Sharia methods, I am 100 per cent pro.’ And when asked . whether there was anything he missed about home, he said: ‘I don’t miss . much. I have a new life here but wouldn’t mind seeing my family live . here with me.’ Others in . the ISIS recruitment video that emerged last month have been identified . as fellow Cardiff youth Reyaad Khan, 20, and Aberdeen-raised Abdul Raqib .

ff2c4a7a207796846b23a86386b831fe5ba5de52,"(CNN) -- For months, Republicans derisively doubted if U.S. President Barack Obama was a true friend of Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, questioning if Americans should re-elect someone who might not be on the same page with the long-time U.S. ally. Now, it's Netanyahu facing political heat in his own country -- for his relationship with Obama. Despite sometimes blistering attacks over where his administration stands on Israel and against Iran's nuclear program, Obama this week emerged victorious in the U.S. presidential election. But Netanyahu has months to go in his own campaign, including time to answer questions about his relationship with the American leader. Leading the charge against the prime minister is the Kadima party, which holds more seats at 28 than any other in Israel's Knesset and which quit Netanyahu's coalition government in July. The centrist party is among those aiming to gain more power and unseat Netanyahu when Israelis go to the polls on January 22, 2013. Kadima wasted little time after Obama's election win in going after Netanyahu. In a post Wednesday on its Facebook page, the party claimed the prime minister had sided with U.S. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and could not be trusted -- by Obama and, moreover, by Israelis -- to be a robust, effective partner with Washington. In that post and in an open letter on its website, Kadima highlighted the importance of U.S.-Israeli relations. Jewish media is abuzz, too, about a Wednesday speech by former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in which he claimed that Netanyahu had interjected himself into the U.S. election by trying to undermine the incumbent president. Multiple Jewish media outlets reported Olmert said Netanyahu got involved in part to satisfy Sheldon Adelson, who donated close to $100 million this year toward defeating Obama and electing Republicans to Congress, according to insiders involved in the process. The Jerusalem Post reported Olmert said that ""Netanyahu's behavior in recent months brings up the question if Netanyahu has a friend in the White House, and I'm not sure."" ""This represents a significant breach of the basic rules governing ties between nations, made worse by the fact that these are allies like Israel and the United States,"" Olmert said in the same speech to Jewish leaders in New York, according to another leading Jewish newspaper, Haaretz. Netanyahu and officials in his government have beaten down such accusations of meddling, while playing up what they describe as strong ties between Israel and the United States. In a statement congratulating Obama, Netanyahu said, ""The security relationship between the United States and Israel is rock solid, and I look forward to working with President Obama to further strengthen this relationship."" In an interview Thursday with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon acknowledged that Romney and Netanyahu have a special connection from having once worked together at the same U.S.-based consulting firm, but ""to say there was a preference, it's a little bit of a stretch."" ""We have no better friend than President Obama,"" Ayalon said, repeating an assertion he'd made previously. The deputy foreign minister credited Obama with spearheading international sanctions and other punitive measures that he said has made Iran ""very vulnerable ... socially, politically, economically."" Whatever past differences there might have been about timelines and goals, Ayalon said Israel will follow the U.S. president's cue when it comes to Iran. ""I think today we can safely say that we are very much of the same page, and we'll continue to follow the lead of the United States,"" he said. Such a line of questioning, and political attacks, about U.S.-Israeli relations is nothing new -- as evidenced in the recent U.S. election. For months, Republicans hammered Obama, claiming he hadn't been a loyal enough friend to Netanyahu or tough enough on Iran. One public dust-up came earlier this fall, when Israeli sources told CNN the White House had turned down a request for a meeting between Netanyahu and Obama while both were in New York for a U.N. meeting, prompting Romney to say he ""can't imagine ever saying no"" to a meeting request from Netanyahu. The White House later said no request had been made, and within hours of the story breaking, Obama called the prime minister and said the two countries maintain ""close cooperation on Iran and other security issues."" The Obama administration has stressed repeatedly that it is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with Israel. In May 2011, the president said, ""The bonds between the United States and Israel are unbreakable, and the commitment of the United States to the security of Israel is ironclad."" Now, the same issue -- how well can Netanyahu and Obama work with and trust each other -- is being debated nearly 6,000 miles from Washington in another heated election. This is a testament to the unique, historically tight relations between these two nations, as well as the vibrant brand of democracy that define their political systems. Despite obvious differences, Netanyahu and Kadima leader Shaul Mofaz did unite this week on one matter -- lauding the U.S. political system and expressing their desire for Israel to follow its lead. Mofaz described ""American democracy (as) a beacon for Israel and her people."" Netanyahu, meanwhile, characterized the United States as ""the greatest democracy on Earth.""","Republicans had criticized Obama over whether he was close enough to Israel .
Now Israeli opposition leaders are saying Netanyahu can't be trusted by Obama .
U.S.-Israeli relations may be a factor in Israel's election, set for January 2013 ."

A Wall Street financier has completed the Ice Bucket Challenge in the most luxurious manner yet, filming himself as he jumps into a freezing tub at his $23.6 million penthouse in downtown Manhattan. Richard B. Handler, the chief executive of the investment bank Jefferies Group and its parent company, the Leucadia National Corporation, decided to skip the bucket all together as he took part in the challenge, which benefits the A.L.S. Association, and instead dunked himself in an icy bath. The video, which was uploaded on Tuesday, prominently showcases his apartment's stunning views of Manhattan. Scroll down for video . Richard B. Handler prepares to take the plunge for the Ice Bucket Challenge in the bathroom of his $23.6 million apartment, with features stunning views of Manhattan . 'There’s a special stipulation in this challenge, I’m not sure people are aware of it,' he says in the video. 'Instead of taking a bucket and dumping it on your head, if you put yourself and dump yourself into the bucket, you’re allowed to nominate four people instead of three people.' Handler, 52,nominated three other Wall Street execs; Tilman J. Fertitta, the CEO of Landry's, Inc.; Gerald Hassell, the CEO of The Bank of New York Mellon; and  Carl Icahn, the 78-year-old businessman whose net worth is $24.5 billion. Icahn took to Twitter to say he would get back to Handler on the challenge, but was currently 'too busy working on BIG deal with another investment banker.' For his fourth nomination, Handler selected rapper Armando Perez, better known as Pitbull. Handler before (pictured left) and after (pictured right) taking the freezing cold plunge . It was another financial bigwig, KCG Chief Executive Officer Daniel Coleman, who nominated Handler. Thanks in large part to the challenge, the A.L.S. Association has received $88.5 million in donations from late July through Tuesday, compared with $2.6 million in the period a year earlier. Handler, whose 2012 salary as CEO of the Jeffries firm was $58 million according to the Daily News, may however soon be losing a little bit of that gorgeous view from his 14th-Floor penthouse, as there is a proposal to build a two-story rooftop restaurant nearby.

Handler's apartment building is almost entirely glass, and provides sweeping 360-degree views of Manhattan . He sued the landlord of 50 Varick Street and the Department of Buildings in March of last year, alleging the restaurant flouted zoning guidelines. 'The project will significantly obstruct the panoramic river views from his apartment,' Handler's lawyer said in their lawsuit.

ff2d013f191a82b78c44731284dae0f0ccf5df77,"By . Claire Bates . UPDATED: . 10:51 EST, 2 January 2012 . A little girl who has spent her entire life crippled by cerebral palsy has  taken her first steps. Since undergoing pioneering surgery in the U.S. Lily Gordon, six, has even managed a few dance steps with the help of a walking frame. Her proud mother, 39-year-old Joanne, of North Shields, North Tyneside, said: 'She is doing so well. She has even joined a musical theatre class and joins in doing little movements with her feet.' Delight: Lily Gordon is now walking after having surgery at the Childrenís Hospital in St Louis, Missouri . This time last year seeing Lily take part in a dance class was something her parents Joanne and David never thought they would see.  But then they watched a programme which would go on to change Lily's life. They heard about the story of a young boy with cerebral palsy who had travelled to America for pioneering Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery to help him walk. As a result Joanne, a finance and commercial manager, decided the family would raise the £50,000 necessary to send Lily to The Children's Hospital, St Louis, in Missouri, USA. It was hoped a four-week stay would make Lily's dreams of walking a reality. Joanne said: 'It was just by the off-chance we had seen the programme, and if we had not heard about it we may never have gone along that road. 'Last year we were just thinking about it around Christmas, we did not know how much it would cost. 'It hard to believe it is 12 months later and it is all over and on her way to recovery. We are so glad we did it.' Joanne with her daughter Lily who had Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy surgery . Months of hard work and endless fundraising finally paid off for the Gordon family and they managed to raise £70,000 by the summer. On August 12, Lily's sixth birthday, Joanne, David, Lily and their oldest daughter Katie, jetted off to America for the long-awaited surgery. Now Lily is home and going through rigorous physiotherapy three times a week after enduring a four- hour operation and then further tendon lengthening surgery in America. Joanne added: 'It is all the little things that mean the world to us such as Lily's handwriting improving since the surgery. 'Some people may expect her to be walking fully by now, but it is things like her sitting on the sofa on her own and the fact we can leave her to sit on a chair whereas before she would have just fallen off it. 'We can see as the weeks go on she is getting stronger. She wants to walk now, and she can if we hold her hand.' According to Scope, it is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contain the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles and which may not be 'transmitting' properly are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. The family have turned their dining room into a mini gym for Lily to build up her strength after the tightness was taken from her muscles. Lily has gone from having large splints the whole way up her leg, to small ankle splints which her parents hope she will be able to remove in the new year. Joanne said: 'Hopefully in the new year we will get her just on her walker - a stable frame which gives her support. 'But the one thing Lily loves about her new splints is that she can now wear sparkly Princess shoes which she could never get her feet into before. 'She has a pair of red sparkly shoes from Next and she just loves them because everyone says she is like Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz. 'She has worked very hard but we have a long way to go but it has been a very good year.'","Lily started with splints the whole way up her leg but now has small ankle splints .

The group of carol singers sneak up on Wojciech Szczesny while he is training, much to the keeper's surprise . Flamini, despite looking somewhat confused, offered the singers a wave when they came into the dressing room, but it was Mertesacker who steals the show in the new adverts. The German, who is set to captain Arsenal through the Christmas period, in the continued absence of Mikel Arteta, joins in with the singers' chants of 'Big Festive German', a play on his nickname at the Emirates stadium. The Gunners stars also revealed their favourite Christmas songs, with Mertesacker a big fan of Wham's classic 'Last Christmas', while Szczesny prefers 'Rocking around the Christmas Tree'. Flamini and Szczesny both agreed that Santi Cazorla would be the best choice of Aresnal player to be Santa Claus, because of his tendency to put on a bit of weight during holidays. The advert is the second featuring BT Sport's Christmas choir - another shows the group outside a house singing songs often heard on the terraces at Manchester United and Chelsea games. BT Sport's Christmas choir feature in two funny adverts as the channel gear up for their festive coverage . PER MERTESACKER . Who would be the best player to dress up as Santa Claus? We have a lovely chef who would love to be Santa Claus! There's no particular player who could be a good Santa Claus! What's your favorite thing about Christmas? In Germany we celebrate on Christmas Eve and in England you celebrate on 25 December so in England, now I have two days to celebrate, so its an extra Christmas for me. What's top of your Christmas list this year? I want to stay as healthy as possible until the last day of this year. And then I'm going to try to put my focus on family time. I will be there for my family and take care of them. Who is the biggest Scrooge in the squad? I just concentrate on celebrating my Christmas! What's your favourite Christmas song? 'Last Christmas', it comes up every Christmas and is kind of a one hit wonder and is loved by everyone! Is there anything you're not allowed at Christmas because you're playing? You can't go crazy. You can celebrate but you have to always be aware that there's going to be a match one or two days after Christmas. So really we're focused on the next games. I try as much as I can to celebrate with the family and to feel that its Christmas time. Time to relax and I really look forward to it. MATHIEU FLAMINI . Who would be the best player to dress up as Santa Claus? Santi Cazorla. That would be funny. We have a chef, the cook, who really looks like Santa Claus. Or Santi. What's your favorite thing about Christmas? The best thing is the opportunity to be together with the family and be with family members that we cannot always see during the year. But Christmas is a great opportunity to be with all family and to be united. What's top of your Christmas list this year? For me the most important thing is to be healthy. To be happy, to have the love of family, love of friends. And after, in terms of professional aspects, to be successful. Who is the biggest Scrooge in the squad? Everyone is very excited about Christmas and generous and giving to others. So I don't think we have anyone like that in our team. What's your favourite Christmas song? 'Jingle Bells'. Definitely my favourite. Is there anything you're not allowed at Christmas because you're playing? We don't drink, with playing every 3 days, its not a good thing to do. So we leave the alcohol on the side to make sure we are focused on the games. WOJCIECH SZCZESNY . Who would be the best player to dress up as Santa Claus? I'd love to see Per Mertesacker dress up as him. But when he retires I think Santi Cazorla will look just like Father Christmas as he has a thing when he goes on holiday he can look just like him and put on some weight! What's your favorite thing about Christmas? Just the family getting together and spending time with my cousins. What's top of your Christmas list this year? I'm not too much into presents. I'm looking forward to spending time with family. It's the only time when my whole family comes to London. That's top of my wish list. Who is the biggest Scrooge in the squad? Podolski. He moans all the time and he doesn't even enjoy Christmas! What's your favourite Christmas song? 'Rocking around the Christmas tree'. I love that. In my first year at the club I had to sing for the first team! Is there anything you're not allowed at Christmas because you're playing? We have to stick to the diet. I do love Christmas food. I try to enjoy it without being silly. But we have to look after ourselves.

Cornick attacked Spanish teacher Ann Maguire after boasting to classmates at Corpus Christi College in Leeds that he wanted to kill her. Now one of his friends has told how he is riddled with guilt for failing to inform school bosses about the threats. Scroll down for video . A friend of classroom murderer Will Cornick (left) has revealed how he is ‘haunted with guilt’ for failing to speak up about the teenager’s threats to kill his teacher, Ann Maguire (right) The 16-year-old said he did not tell teachers because he did not believe Cornick would act on what he had said. He told the Daily Mirror: 'I don’t think about it as much as I did. I try not to. But I do still feel guilty because If I’d told someone, she would be alive today. I could have stopped it. ‘I didn’t tell the teachers because I really never thought he would do anything. ‘I thought he was just trying to scare us. I thought it was bravado - just a sick, terrible joke. I just thought it was a teenage thing.’ Cornick, 16, knifed Mrs Maguire to death at the school in April this year. He also said he was going to murder other teachers, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’. The killing, at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds, shocked Britain and is believed to be the first time a teacher has been killed by a student in the classroom in the UK . He later told doctors: ‘I said I was going to do other stuff but I never got the chance, other murders. It was a triple homicide.’ After the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’ Cornick was sentenced to life in jail earlier this month and a judge warned him he may never be released. Judge Mr Justice Coulson called the murder a 'monumental act of cowardice and evil' and branded the teenager's pride and lack of remorse over his actions 'truly grotesque'. Cornick was initially taken to Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire before being moved for his own safety.","Friend of Will Cornick reveals guilt at not alerting school to killer's threats .

ff2dfb49651c10e421ecbb7f15f15a062d17aab1,"(CNN) -- Big Ben, arguably the world's most famous clock, celebrates on Sunday 150 years of keeping London on time. The British landmark has lived through war, bad weather and disasters. Big Ben's distinctive bongs have been a part of the London scene for 150 years. Big Ben is the 14-ton bell inside the world's largest four-faced chiming clock, although most people use the name to describe the tower that houses it. The clock is perched on a 96-meter (310-foot) elegant tower at the Westminster Bridge end of the Palace of Westminster. The Victorian masterpiece, which provides distinctive chimes known as bongs, was voted Britain's favorite monument in 2008. It has been featured in films such as ""101 Dalmatians"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix."" Big Ben has been disrupted a few times over the years for various reasons, including weather and breakages. Its bongs went silent for about two months in August 2007 to allow a crew to repair its mechanism system. During that time, the rest of the clock was running on an electric system. It was fully restarted again October 1. The clock pays tribute to Britain's royal history: It has a Latin inscription of the phrase: ""O Lord, save our Queen Victoria the First."" The ornate masterpiece has some quirky features. The hour hand, which weighs 300 kilograms (661 pounds), is made of gun metal while the minute hands are made of copper sheet. The minute hands would not work when they were first made of cast iron because they were too heavy. The clock started working on May 31, 1859, after the lighter copper hands were installed. The origins of the landmark's name are obscure. Some say it was named after the 1850s heavyweight boxer Ben Caunt while others suggest it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, a former member of parliament. Hall, the commissioner of works in 1859, was responsible for ordering the bell. Alan Hughes, the director of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry that made the bell, prefers the latter. ""I suppose I like it chiefly because it was a nickname of a man who was big and loud and pompous, and never used one word if 27 would do,"" he said in a 2008 interview. Hughes' company also made America's Liberty Bell and a number of others for cathedrals and churches around the world.","London's Big Ben turns 150 years old on Sunday .

It has recorded monthly temperatures across an area between Lancaster, Bristol and London since 1659. For the whole UK, 2014 is the warmest in records dating back to 1910. The year’s crazy weather saw the wettest winter to strike southern England since records began in 1766, with severe flooding in Somerset, Kent and the Thames Valley suffering extreme flooding. Temperatures then hit 19C (66F) in the South in March, when the average is 9C (48F). A July heatwave roared in, with temperatures in the mid-30s (over 90F), but it was swiftly followed by the coolest August for 21 years as the remnants of Hurricane Bertha crossed the Atlantic bringing with it downpours and flash floods – just in time to catch the school holidays. After this, the driest-ever September preceded the warmest Halloween on record. Experts say that while a bitterly cold December could still knock 2014 off its top spot in the list of warmest years, this is unlikely. While all months except August have seen above average temperatures, no single month has seen a record-breaking high. Instead the year has been consistently warm. Can't make its mind up: This year has seen a July heatwave followed by the coolest August for 21 years and then the driest September ever .

Feeling the cold: While all months except August have seen above average temperatures, no single month has seen a record-breaking high . Across the world, the year is also on track to be one of the hottest, with global temperatures around 0.57C (1.03F) above the average 14C (57.2F) from January to October, just ahead of the previous record of 0.56C, according to the World Meteorological Organisation. However, the Met Office said that a single year’s extreme weather cannot be attributed to man-made global warming. A spokesman said: ‘One warm year does not necessarily say anything about long-term climate change – these trends need to be looked at over longer timescales of several decades.’ But global warming does make it more likely to have years with hotter-than-average weather, he said. Global: Last year is also set to be the warmest across the globe as temperature rises pushed the average 0.57C above the average of 14C .

Officers saved 13 Slovakian 'slaves' during a raid at a picture framing factory in Rochdale. They have alleged they were working in terrible conditions and were paid £25 for an 80-hour week after deductions for rent and travel. The home they lived in is bare, filthy and some of them were forced to sleep on a mattress on the floor. Filthy: The Rochdale house where the 13 Slovakian slaves lived. They were paid £25 for an 80-hour week after rent was deducted for the squalid home and travel . One officer said: 'The men and women were effectively working for pennies, while simultaneously ensuring they remain reliant on the people enslaving them'. Pictured, a mattress on the floor in their spartan home . Grim: Washing dries in a bare, filthy room in the Rochdale house the workers were forced to live in . The 'slaves', all adults, were found during a police raid working in a unit on a business park and had been subject to 'physical and verbal abuse', say police. Four men, aged, 34 51, 43 and 40, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to require another person to perform forced or compulsory labour and conspiracy to commit trafficking offences. The raid follows the previous discovery of 10 other eastern European 'slaves' at a house in Rochdale, where the workers were being kept four to a room. It is the latest phase of Operation Retriever, designed to tackle human trafficking in Rochdale. Its first strike last month ended with five people being charged over their alleged involvement in a trafficking ring which is said to have sold a pregnant woman into a sham marriage and then attempted to trick her into aborting her baby. More pictures showing the squalid conditions. The raid follows the previous discovery of 10 other eastern European 'slaves' at a house in Rochdale, where the workers were being kept four to a room . Commenting on the latest raid, Det Insp James Faulkner said: 'This is another excellent result from a joint operation which has strived to uncover and protect vulnerable victims from the men and women hoping to exploit them for their own financial gain. 'The men and women working in the factory have told us that they were subjected to physical and verbal assaults at the hands of their employers and forced to work more than 80 hours before ending up with around £25 for their week's work. 'This is a typical example of how modern slavery can work in the UK. 'The men and women are promised accommodation and jobs, but are forced to live in cramped, terrible conditions before being taken to work in a factory for more than 12 hours each day.' The 13 'slaves', all adults, were found during a police raid working in a unit on a business park. Four men, aged 35, 51, 43 and 40, were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to require another person to perform forced or compulsory labour and conspiracy to commit trafficking offences . He added: 'At the end of the week, the factory owners pay them around £125 for their 80 hours, but then take up to £100 away immediately for rent, travel and other expenses. 'This leaves the men and women effectively working for pennies, while simultaneously ensuring they remain reliant on the people enslaving them. 'When you consider that this factory was producing frames and pictures for major high street companies, with contracts running into the millions of pounds, it proves just how much money these men stood to make from this exploitation. 'Now GMP and our partners in Rochdale council will be striving to safeguard these victims from further exploitation, and we will do our utmost to ensure that the people responsible for this injustice are punished to the full extent of the law.' Mark Widdup, director of economy and environment with Rochdale council, said: 'Today's raid is another example of agencies working together to share, connect and act on information, quickly and effectively. 'Through truly groundbreaking initiatives like PET, the Partnership Enforcement Team, we use all our tools and powers, be it through housing, revenues and benefits or trading standards to disrupt criminality in the borough.

ff2f97c885cc1c0e1cd88dfe4a075581f8293f69,"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Read my lips: Obama told the AMA four years ago that 'no matter how we reform health care ... If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.' Between half and three-quarters of Americans who buy their own health insurance on the open market will lose those plans in the next year as Obamacare is pushed into full implementation, according to a blockbuster report sure to give the White House a new round of health-care headaches. 'No matter how we reform health care,' a newly minted President Barack Obama told a meeting of the American Medical Association in June 2009, 'we will keep this promise: If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away. No matter what.' But regulations formulated by his own administration make it . clear that the White House never intended to to give Americans that . level of free choice about their medical insurance options. Washington, D.C. buzzed Friday with reports of what NBC News had surfaced: an under-the-radar notice in the Federal Register, which MailOnline has dated to June 17, 2010, laying out the administration's expectation that most people who buy their own health insurance will soon have no options other than paying exorbitant rates or joining the federal government's insurance exchanges. White House spokeswoman Jessica Santillo told NBC that 'nothing . in the Affordable Care Act forces people out of their health plans: The . law allows plans that covered people at the time the law was enacted to . continue to offer that same coverage to the same enrollees.' But millions of individual insurance plans don't comply with Obamacare's minimum standards, which include services like children's vision care, dental coverage and reproductive health options that some consumers don't want. Millions more with policies written before March 2010 will lose the 'grandfather' status President Obama has promised them because of tiny, marginal changes like premium adjustments or revised prescription copay rates. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . White House spokesmanJay Carney conceded Monday that 'it's true that there are existing healthcare plans on the individual market that don't meet [Obamacare's] minimum standards and therefore do not qualify' to survive . Smoking gun: The IRS published official notice in 2010 that it expected most Americans with individual health insurance plans would lose them under Obamacare . I told you so: A spokesman for long-time Obamacare foe Sen. Ted Cruz emailed the NBC News report all over Washington on Monday as soon as it hit the Internet . 'Any insurance that you currently have would be grandfathered in so you could keep it,' President Obama claimed during a CNN broadcast in February 2010. 'And so you could decide not to get, in the exchange, the better plan. I could keep my Acme insurance, just a high-deductible catastrophic plan. I would not be required to get the better one.' John Kyl, then a Republican senator from Arizona, countered with words that now seem prescient: 'That's for a very limited period of time.' The White House's website continues to communicate the president's earlier promises. 'If you like your plan you can keep it,' one page reads, 'and you don’t have to change a thing due to the health care law.' Under the Affordable Care Act and the tens of thousands of pages of related regulations, the grandfathering Obama promised only applies to insurance policies that continue, unchanged, from year to year. Requirements in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 often force health insurers to rewrite their policies annually in order to re-state consumers' privacy guarantees, now well-known as 'HIPPA' rights. That simple act of re-issuing a policy that's identical to the previous one would also render it ineligible for 'grandfather' status. 'A reasonable range for the percentage of individual policies that would terminate and therefore relinquish their grandfather status is 40 to 67 percent,' the IRS wrote on July 17, 2010. The White House's website continues to claim: 'If you like your plan you can keep it and you don't have to change a thing due to the health care law' That estimate only covers policies that lose their 'grandfathered' status by changing, and those which Americans voluntarily leave for other reasons. But still more will lose coverage, the IRS wrote, because their chosen levels of insurance will suddenly fail to meet the White House's definition of an adequate policy. 16 million: Health care analyst Bob Laszewski predicts that's the number of Americans who will lose their preferred medical insurance plans in the coming months . The annual total likely 'exceeds the 40 percent to 67percent range,' according to the IRS's statement more than three years ago. Overall, NBC reported Monday that of the 14 million U.S. consumers who buy individual health insurance plans, 50 to 75 per cent will likely receive cancellation notices during the next year. And the administration has been expecting that outcome since 2010. That conclusion came as a result of estimates from four sources deeply involved with the administration's work on the Affordable Care Act, one of whom said as many as 80 per cent of individual insurance customers will be short on choices by this time in 2014. Months of wrangling over the Obamacare law in 2009 included jousting over whether a range of services including mental health and drug abuse treatments, dental provisions and and vision care for children should be mandated for every qualifying insurance policy, even though not all consumers want them. Democrats generally won those battles, resulting in a minimum set of health insurance standards that has placed most individual policies out-of-bounds. In their places are new, more robust plans expected to bring 'sticker shock' to millions. Health policy analyst Bob Laszewski, who consults with America's largest insurers, estimated this month that 'as many as 16 million' such policies will be canceled because they don't comply with the Obamacare law. That represents 80 per cent of his estimate that 19 million such plans, provided by neither governments nor employers, are in existence today. Fox News Channel's Megyn Kelly exploded: Obama 'said ""if you like your plan you can keep it, period."" If he wanted to be honest, he should not have said ""period."" He should have said ""asterisk."" News networks buzzed late on Friday as they discovered what NBC had found: evidence that the Obama administration has known for three years that the president's promise simply couldn't be kept. This example, from July 19, 2010, hit the Internet five weeks after the IRS published it in the Federal Register (above) The White House has begun to concede that many Americans who buy their health insurance directly from companies on the open market will lose their current coverage, but counters that most of them will find better coverage on the exchanges, and at a lower net cost when subsidies for lower-income taxpayers are factored in. Cornered by a reporter on Monday, . White House Press Secretary Jay Carney admitted that 'there are going to . be changes brought about by the Affordable Care Act to create minimum . standards of coverage, minimum services that every insurance plan has to . provide.' 'So it's true,' he said, 'that there are existing healthcare plans on the individual . market that don't meet those minimum standards and therefore do not . qualify for the Affordable Care Act.' The National Center for Public Policy Research has chronicled recent news reports documenting 1.49 million policy cancellation notices that insurers have already sent customers in New Jersey, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Additional reports in  Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, the organization said, came without precise numbers. In California, the Los Angeles Times reports that the recipients of those letters are surprised to learn how much they would have to pay to stay insured without entering a government-run program. 'This is when the actual sticker shock comes into play for people,' Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, told the Times. 'There are winners and losers under the Affordable Care Act.' How long are Americans' memories? Obama's 2009 American Medical Association speech, and the dozens that preceded and followed it, laid down a marker on consumer choice that he won't find it easy to escape . HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius (L) will face congressional questions Wednesday about the Obamacare rollout and what it means for health insurance consumers. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Marilyn Tavenner (R) will have her turn Tuesday. On Tuesday a key Obamacare administrator will testify in a House Ways and Means Committee hearing about the unrelated technical failures that have plagued Healthcare.gov, the Obamacare system's main website. Marilyn Tavenner, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, will face tough questions about why the website was launched without adequate testing, and why her agency was tapped to coordinate the work of dozens of software contractors instead of a more experienced outside company. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius will have her turn on the hot seat Wednesday, when she faces a hostile panel in a House Commerce and Energy Committee hearing. Sebelius's grilling will likely include broader questions about the Obamacare program. She was asked to appear in Congress last week but declined.","President Obama has promised for 4 years that individual health insurance policies will be 'grandfathered' in so they won't change under Obamacare .

Bottles, fireworks and smoke bombs were set off as 1,500 officers tried to contain thousands of English Defence League supporters holding a protest march in Luton today. The town centre was flooded with police as tensions mounted that the right wing organisation's members might clash with a counter demonstration by a 1,000-strong group from Unite Against Fascism at the same time in the usually busy shopping area.

A Chinese government think tank has urged the country's leaders to start phasing out its one-child policy immediately and allow two children for every family by 2015. The unpopular restriction - which has been in place since 1980 - has led to millions fewer births, but also contributed to the ageing of China's huge population. The proposal is being given extra weight because it has been put forward by the China Development Research Foundation which is close to the government's central leadership. Treasured: China's one-child policy has been criticised in a government report. The a body close to the Chinese Government has called for the system to be phased out during the next few years (file picture) The official Xinhua News Agency said the . foundation recommends a two-child policy be permitted in some provinces from this . year and nationwide by 2015. Xie Meng, a press affairs official with the foundation, said the final version of the report wil be released 'in a week or two.' But Chinese state media have been given advance copies. It proposes all birth limits be dropped by 2020, Xinhua reported. 'China has paid a huge political and social cost for the policy, as it has resulted in social conflict, high administrative costs and led indirectly to a long-term gender imbalance at birth,' Xinhua said, citing the report. But it remains unclear whether Chinese leaders are ready to take up the recommendations. Some experts have also warned that the gradual approach, . if implemented, would still be insufficient to help correct the . problems that China's strict birth limits have created. China's National Population and Family Planning Commission had no immediate comment on the report today. Ageing: China's population is now aging fast following decades of birth restrictions (file picture) Known to many as the one-child policy, China's actual birth-restriction rules are more complicated. The government limits most urban couples to one child, and allows two children for rural families if their first-born is a girl. There are numerous other exceptions as well, including looser rules for minority families and a two-child limit for parents who are themselves both singletons. Cai Yong, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said the report holds extra weight because the think tank is under the State Council, China's Cabinet. He said he found it remarkable that state-backed demographers were willing to publicly propose such a detailed schedule and plan on how to get rid of China's birth limits. 'That tells us at least that policy change is inevitable, it's coming,' said Mr Yong, who was not involved in the drafting of the report but knows many of the experts who were. 'It's coming, but we cannot predict when exactly it will come,' he said. Adding to the uncertainty is a once-in-a-decade leadership transition that kicks off week that will see a new slate of top leaders installed by spring 2013. Mr Yong said the transition could keep population reform on the back burner or changes might be rushed through to help burnish the reputations of President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao on their way out. There has been growing speculation in China over whether the government will relax the one-child policy - introduced in 1980 as a temporary measure to curb surging population growth - and allow more people to have two children. Though the government credits the policy with preventing hundreds of millions of births and helping lift countless families out of poverty, it is reviled by many ordinary people. The strict limits have led to forced abortions and sterilizations, even though such measures are illegal. Choice: Chinese women walk their babies in a park in Beijing. The one-child policy has led to a major gender imbalance as many families favour having boys rather than girls (file picture) Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs. Many demographers argue that the policy has worsened the country's aging crisis by limiting the size of the young labor pool that must support the large baby boom generation as it retires. They say it has contributed to the imbalanced sex ratio by encouraging families to abort baby girls, preferring to try for a male heir. The government recognizes those problems and has tried to address them by boosting social services for the elderly. It has also banned sex-selective abortion and rewarded rural families whose only child is a girl. Many today also see the birth limits as outdated, a relic of the era when housing, jobs and food were provided by the state. 'It has been thirty years since our planned economy was liberalised,' commented Wang Yi, the owner of a shop that sells textiles online, under a news report on the foundation's proposal. 'So why do we still have to plan our population?' Rescued: An abducted child is shown with a crude marking on the back of his neck in Guiyang, southwestern China. The one child policy has fuelled the market for baby smuggling, as parents sell off unwanted children . Though open debate about the policy has flourished in state media and on the Internet, leaders have so far expressed a desire to maintain the status quo. President Hu said last year that China would keep its strict family planning policy to keep the birth rate low and other officials have said that no changes are expected until at least 2015. Gu Baochang, a professor of demography at Beijing's Renmin University and a vocal advocate of reform, said the proposed timeline wasn't aggressive enough. 'They should have reformed this policy ages ago,' he said. 'It just keeps getting held up, delayed.'","Unpopular birth restrictions introduced in 1980 when population was rapidly expanding .

ff30555b670e1d914a1940feee0bef15dcc3c792,"Liverpool have been dealt a blow in their bid to bring Divock Origi back from Lille after the striker confirmed he will remain in France for the remainder of the season. Brendan Rodgers had given the green light to pay an increase on the £10million fee they agreed with Lille to accelerate Origi’s release in January. The Belgium forward, whom Rodgers believes will be a ‘world-class striker’, joined Liverpool in August but was immediately loaned back to Lille to continue his development before heading to Anfield next summer. Divock Origi (No 17) is congratulated by his Belgium team-mates after scoring against Iceland on Wednesday . The 20-year-old, scoring against Iceland, is staying with French side Lille until the end of the season . But such is Liverpool’s keenness to bring Origi in to the fold they were ready to pay a premium to get him in the new year. But Origi confirmed on Friday afternoon that he won’t return to the Anfield club until the end of the current campaign. ‘I just wanted to clarify after today's press reports that I will continue to give my all and 100 per cent for Lille over the coming months,’ Origi said via his Twitter account. ‘I am very much looking forward to joining Liverpool from next season.’ Rodgers’ side have been desperately short of goals, with Daniel Sturridge missing 14 games through injury and Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggling. The trio have failed to find the net in 998 minutes of Premier League action. The 20-year-old, pictured in action against Origi, but the Belgian will not play in the Premier League this term . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers wanted to bring Lille back into the Liverpool fold in the new year . Lille gave no indication that they would be willing to re-jig the original terms of the deal, which meant Origi would stay the full season in France, and hand the striker to Liverpool early - even if the 19-year-old admitted earlier this week that he would be happy to move in January. ‘It is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in January I would go, I would like to join Liverpool then,’ said Origi, who scored for Belgium in their 3-1 win over Iceland on Wednesday. ‘I said I would stay for the whole season and I wish to remain honourable in that, of course. But if there was a decision by the clubs, I would not say I wouldn’t like to go to Liverpool in January.

ff30e1bb720683671ada265514a3a13fa7cdd891,"Success treatment: The 'mini-IVF' has had twice the success rates as the conventional method . A half-price version of IVF that women could have in their lunch-hour has been shown to raise the chances of having a baby drastically. It is particularly effective for those in their late 30s and early 40s and success rates are almost twice as high as the conventional fertility treatment. The technique involves using far lower doses of drugs, with the result that it is not only far cheaper, but also has virtually no side effects. Many women undergoing normal IVF suffer from mood swings, nausea and headaches. In rare cases it can cause a life-threatening condition whereby their abdomen fills with fluid. This new method, known as mini-IVF, involves giving women a daily pill for ten to 12 days which contains a low dose of the fertility drug clomid. This encourages their ovaries to produce eggs and during this time the women undergo ultrasound scans every few days to check the eggs are developing healthily. Once the eggs are large enough – around another ten days later – they are removed during a five-minute operation. This means women can have it done before work, or during their lunch break, unlike normal IVF which lasts half a day and requires them to be put to sleep. Doctors from St Louis, Missouri, who developed the method say it should be routinely offered to all women as it is cheaper, safer and a far more effective alternative. Trials involving 520 women unveiled at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference in Boston showed that success rates for women over 35 were a third higher compared with those undergoing conventional IVF. The results were even better among the over-40s – those using this new method were twice as likely to have a baby compared to if they had used the conventional  fertility treatment. Dr Sherman Silber, a fertility expert who helped develop the method, said it was so effective it offered women in their 40s the same chance of falling pregnant as those in their twenties. Too good to be true? The new IVF treatment is particularly effective for those in their late 30s and early 40s, using far lower doses of drugs, and also has virtually no side effects . In women aged 35 or below, success rates are about the same as standard IVF but the researchers say they would also benefit from using it because it is far cheaper and has fewer side effects. Dr Silber said: ‘This is perfect for Britain and it would save an incredible amount of money. This is the magic solution.’ A course of mini-IVF costs between £1,200 and £1,800 compared with standard IVF which is between £3,000 and £4,000. The reason it is so much cheaper is that it involves using far lower doses of the fertility drug clomid. But this also makes it safer as large amounts of medication can lead to the deadly condition ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome whereby their abdomens fill with fluid – this occurs in 1 per cent of women having IVF. One of main reasons women in their late 30s and early 40s have problems conceiving either naturally or with IVF is that they do not produce enough healthy eggs, capable of developing into an embryo and eventually a foetus. In fact, the high dose fertility drugs used in conventional IVF worsen this problem as although they make a woman produce more eggs, they also appear to result in changes in the DNA of the eggs which make them defective. But mini-IVF only uses very low doses of the drugs that do not make the woman’s eggs less healthy. Professor Geeta Nargund, a  consultant gynaecologist at the London fertility clinic Create said: ‘This study is a valuable addition to the growing evidence that mild stimulation IVF needs to become the first choice in IVF clinics for many women.’","New IVF treatment particularly effective for those aged 35-45 .
Technique uses lower doses of drugs, yet is twice as effective .

The son of a deacon was fatally shot Sunday morning by police after congregation members got riled up at a meeting. Police were called to the Asia Missionary Baptist Church in Lexington, Mississippi mid-day Sunday after a congregation meeting turned violent. They were already at the church when 26-year-old Cacedrick White showed up, armed. Shot: 26-year-old Cacedrick White was shot and killed when he showed up to his church armed with a shot gun . Riled up: White's father was a deacon at the Asia Missionary Baptist Church, and was in the church when the congregation got in a fight about whether or not to retain their current pastor . The atmosphere at a congregant meeting had turned violent when deacons tried to fire the pastor. The pastor was trying to hold a vote on whether to retain him. 'What happened was a bunch of the pastor's family showed up and there was a whole bunch of yelling and hollering,' Warren Strain, Bureau of Investigation spokesman told the AP.

ff320f6d94f5fcc211870950c64056713b8ad8c7,"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats acting like Republicans. Republicans acting like Democrats. The 2016 presidential contest is shaping up to be the political equivalent of gender-bending. Democrats are coalescing early around a front-runner who certainly will be lavishly funded, Hillary Clinton. She's campaigning on the familiar GOP platform: ""Next in line."" Meanwhile, a twice-beaten Republican Party finds itself doing as Democrats often did in the Reagan era, surveying a field of little-knowns and hoping for magic. The Republican field is led by two freshman senators: Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, plus a member of the House and the party's 2012 vice presidential nominee, Paul Ryan. Three things are immediately striking about the top of the Republican field: . 1) It's not only Washington-based, but it's all congressionally based. There is no governor in the top three, no general, no former Cabinet secretary, nobody with any notable private-sector accomplishment. 2) It's light on accomplishment. Ryan has to date been the most productive of the top three, but none of his famous budgets have been passed into law. Paul can cite no legislative accomplishments at all, only a stunt filibuster against the entirely imaginary menace of drone strikes against American citizens on American soil. Rubio has taken a lead role in immigration reform but must make some tough decisions about whether his future is best secured by negotiating a deal or scuttling one. None of the three Republican front-runners has any administrative experience to speak of. 3) It's intensely doctrinaire. Ryan was the author of much of the Republican Party's post-2009 tea party program. Rubio has to date shown himself an undeviating follower of that program. Paul dissents from some aspects of that program but in the direction of even greater extremism. A party rebuilding from back-to-back presidential defeats has to face the possibility that the problem may be bigger than its candidate, bigger than its campaign tactics. There are a couple of obvious ways to address that possibility: . The party might look for an outsider nominee, a candidate so attractive in his or her own right as to offset the party's own unpopularity. This is what Republicans did by nominating Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 after five consecutive defeats by New Deal Democrats. Or the party might allow an insider some latitude to edge back toward the political center. This is what Democrats did in 1992 when they nominated a pro-death penalty, pro-welfare reform, pro-free trade governor of Arkansas after losses under the party-line liberals, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. In 2016, however, Republicans as yet show no inclination to try either remedy. No independent superstar; no deviation from party line orthodoxy. The one Republican with the highest cross-partisan appeal, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, has been consigned to fourth place. As the saying goes, the first step toward recovery is to acknowledge the problem. The problem in 2012 -- as in 2008, as in the near-death experience of 2004, as in the popular vote loss of 2000, as in the loss of 1996, as in the loss of 1992 -- was the GOP's failure to offer an economic program relevant to the problems of middle-class Americans. The party's present three front-runners would not only repeat that failure, but double down on that failure. The Republican Party desperately needs renewal, its early presidential front-runners are characterized by their rejection of change. At a time when voters reject generic Republicanism, Republicans themselves are rallying to two of the most generic Republicans in the party -- and a third, Paul, who diverges from generic Republicanism only by offering voters even more of what they most dislike about today's GOP. The party talks about learning from its mistakes. Thus far, the main thing the party seems to have learned from those mistakes is how to repeat them. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum: Democrats could pick 2008 also-ran Hillary Clinton for 2016 .
He says Republican front-runners seem unlikely to measure up .
Despite losses, GOP could pick long shots such as Marco Rubio or Rand Paul, he says .

Police inspect the suspect's vehicle in Washington on Friday. Christopher Shelton Timmons, 27, has been charged with carrying a deadly weapon, having an unregistered firearm and having unregistered ammunition, Capitol Police spokeswoman Sgt.

In addition to the rifle -- an AK-47 -- police found a grenade, a pistol, ammunition, loaded magazines ""and several other items of concern to the police"" in the Jeep Cherokee he was driving. Authorities said Timmons was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon in March in Albemarle County, Virginia, and served a month in jail. In that incident, Timmons had two grenades in his car, said Albemarle Police Chief John Miller. The pins had been removed and the grenades were filled with powder, authorities said. They had an adhesive on top to close them and a firecracker for a fuse. Law enforcement sources said the grenades were similar to an item found in Timmons vehicle Friday.

ff33c04e31c0fc358558de91ed244603a395dd72,"(CNN) -- The NFL has a simple answer for critics who claim the league should have been able to get videos of Ray Rice knocking out his future wife and dragging her out of an elevator. It would have been illegal, Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote in a memo Wednesday to the top officials of the NFL's 32 teams. ""Once a criminal investigation begins, law enforcement authorities do not share investigatory material (such as the videos here) with private parties such as the NFL,"" he wrote in a note to chief executives and club presidents. ""In addition, (New Jersey's) Open Public Records Act excludes material that is generated in the context of an active law enforcement proceeding."" The Associated Press, however, reported Wednesday that a law enforcement official said he sent a copy of the video in April to an NFL executive and someone called him from an NFL office phone to thank him for sending the video. The NFL reacted to the story by saying the league is unaware of anyone in its office having the video in their possession and officials would look into the report. NFL toughens domestic violence policy with six-game bans . Rice has been suspended indefinitely from the NFL and was cut by the Baltimore Ravens after a video surfaced this week showing him punching Janay Rice, who at the time was his fiancee, in an elevator in Atlantic City on February 15. Rice was eventually charged with third-degree assault by Atlantic County prosecutors, but as a first-time offender was able to enter into a diversionary program. If he successfully completes the program in one year, the charge will be removed from his record. Timeline of events in the Ray Rice story . Critics have said the NFL should have been able to get the videos and should have banned Rice for life instead of initially giving him a two-game suspension. The ban was increased after the in-elevator video was posted online by TMZ Sports on Monday. It was the second dramatic video in the case. The first showed the aftermath of the ferocious blow. In it Rice drags his unconscious fiancee off the elevator and talks to a security staffer. Goodell doesn't rule out a return for Rice . Goodell also said the hotel couldn't legally provide the video to the NFL because of the investigation into the incident. ""We did not ask the Atlantic City casino directly for the video,"" he wrote. ""Again, our understanding of New Jersey law is that the casino is prohibited from turning over material to a third party during a law enforcement proceeding, and that doing so would have subjected individuals to prosecution for interference with a criminal investigation."" Goodell said the Rice legal proceedings are still an ""open matter."" NFL's past penalties for domestic violence 'a different story' TMZ executive producer Harvey Levin told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Tuesday that they paid for the videos. ""I think what happened was the casino closed. And when the casino closed, I think there were a lot of employees who just said, you know what: 'We want to do the right thing.' And ultimately we ended up getting this video because when you look at the video, clearly you see the NFL did not do the right thing,"" Levin said of the second video. ""And I think at a point somebody said that the gain here is worse than the risk, in terms of doing what's right."" The Revel casino closed eight days ago. The Baltimore Sun petitioned for the release of the elevator video under the Freedom of Information Act, but its request was denied by New Jersey officials.

Blatter will be bidding for a fifth term in office at the election in May, with so far only three candidates - French former FIFA executive Jerome Champagne, Prince Ali Bin Hussein of Jordan and former Tottenham winger David Ginola - having declared their intention to stand against him. Speaking in an interview with CNN World Sport, the 78-year-old said: 'I have been asked by the national associations to be our candidate again because nobody that is strong was in. So I go there. Sepp Blatter has accused UEFA of lacking the 'courage' to provide a challenge to his leadership . 'All those who want to get rid of me should come. All this opposition is coming now, it's unfortunate to say - but it's true - it's coming from Nyon, from UEFA. They don't have the courage to come in. So let me go (on) - be respectful.' He continued: 'Football is a team sport. Let's go together with the team. I invite the confederation of UEFA and especially the leaders of UEFA that are so bitterly attacking me: Join! Join!

Blatter and UEFA president Michel Platini together during the World Cup . Football Association chairman Greg Dyke and England's UEFA vice-president David Gill were last June at the forefront of a European rebellion against Blatter - saying he should not commit a U-turn on his 2011 pledge to stand down in 2015 - despite the incumbent president appearing to have huge support in other continental confederations. Blatter insists he has unfinished business and will not step aside without a fight. 'I have not finished my mission because it's a mission to be in football,' said the Swiss, who launched FIFA's governance reform process in June 2011 at the 61st FIFA Congress in Zurich, shortly after being re-elected for a fourth mandate. Former Tottenham winger David Ginola will stand against Blatter in the upcoming election . 'We have started in 2011 with the reform process. The reform process is not over.' Asked if he was nervous about the upcoming election, he replied: 'No, no. Definitely not. It is impossible to make everybody happy. If I would have only positive press, then it would not be good. And I like criticism as long as the criticism is... I would say fair criticism.' Despite stating his firm intention to continue in his current role, Blatter also outlined plans for his life after FIFA. 'The day I'm going to retire, the first thing I'm going to do is radio,' he said. 'I always said I will do radio. Because radio is even more popular than television, than all electronics. I said one day - this was my boy's wish - to be a radio reporter.'

The historic ocean liner carried princes and presidents across the Atlantic in the 1950s and 1960s but has spent decades patiently awaiting a savior at its berth on the Philadelphia waterfront. 'We've made progress on the fundraising side and the redevelopment side,' said Susan Gibbs, executive director of the SS United States Conservancy and granddaughter of the ship's Philadelphia-born designer, William Francis Gibbs. 'Our immediate goal is to buy some time.' The group has raised $1 million through fundraisers and a website, where contributors can sponsor a piece of the ship for $1 per square foot. But the campaigners say they desperately need donors with deep pockets and high profiles to help save the ship. 'Are we giving up on successfully redeveloping the ship as a self-sustaining entity? Absolutely not,' said Dan McSweeney, head of the redevelopment efforts. At risk: The 990-foot-long ship could be sold for scrap in two months time unless $500,000 is raised to save it . High costs: It costs $80,000 every month for mooring, maintenance, insurance and security . Ravaged: Moored in Philadelphia, the SS United States is now owned by the nonprofit SS United States Conservancy . 'We continue to have active discussions with potential partners, we have ideas of potential sites for the ship, but we need more time to get it off the ground ... and we're running out of runway.' It costs $80,000 a month just for mooring, basic maintenance, insurance and security, he said. The conservancy is exploring potential partnerships with four entities in Philadelphia and New York City to refashion the vessel as a stationary entertainment complex with 500,000 square feet of space for a hotel, theater, restaurants and shopping. The sluggish economy and other factors have slowed negotiations, McSweeney said. As talks continue, he said, the hope is to convince corporate sponsors, influential politicians and prominent business leaders - are you listening, Donald Trump and Michael Bloomberg? - to lend their political and financial capital to the effort. 'Any way you look at it, there is no downside to this project,' McSweeney said. 'It's an economic and community development project that's going to create jobs.' A lot of work to do: The rusted and ruined interior view of the SS United States . Heyday: The SS United States pictured in front of the Midtown Manhattan skyline and Empire State building as it begins its first voyage along the Hudson River to Europe from New York in 1952 . The SS United States carried more than one million passengers at record-breaking transatlantic speeds over the course of 400 round trips from 1952 to 1969, among them President John F. Kennedy, Prince Rainier of Monaco, Salvador Dali and Elizabeth Taylor. A joint venture between the Navy and ship designer Gibbs & Cox, the luxury liner was made with hidden military might - it could have been converted in a single day to transport 14,000 troops for 10,000 miles before refueling. After being decommissioned it changed hands multiple times, from the Navy and on through a series of restoration-minded investors. It was towed from Virginia to Turkey to Ukraine, finally arriving in Philadelphia as a gutted hulk in 1996. Another succession of developers and a cruise lines failed to return the ship to service as retrofitting costs proved too great. A local philanthropist's 11th-hour gift of $5.8 million allowed the SS United States Conservancy to save the ship from the scrapper and keep it berthed and maintained for 20 months. That was last November. 'It's an all hands on deck moment,' Gibbs said. 'Now is the time, there's a window. Within months it will close unless everyone assists in the effort.' Record holder: The once-great liner is still the holder of the Blue Riband for the fastest trans-Atlantic crossing which it set in July of 1952 . Special honour: The ship is still the only man-made object within America to bear the name United States .","Vessel carried more than one million passengers  over 400 round .

""If you don't do something to stop that -- that's when there's something wrong with you."" In their first-ever joint prime time interview, actress Demi Moore and actor Ashton Kutcher will be guests on Thursday's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" The husband-and-wife team launched The Demi & Ashton Foundation (DNA) after a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in January. They met a girl who had been trafficked into the United States by her pimp, who brought her into a field where she was repeatedly raped on a trash bag by 30 men. The DNA Foundation stands for the fundamental right to freedom for every person -- because it's within our DNA. ""It just seemed impossible to live in a world where that was going on and not, you know, do something about it,"" said Moore. More: The CNN Freedom Project: Ending Modern-Day Slavery . According to Kutcher, the average age of entry into the sex trade is 13. ""And that's globally, by the way,"" added the actor, who also pointed out that many Americans view child sex slavery as a problem in places that they have no control over, such as Cambodia, India or Nepal. Kutcher wants to people to realize trafficking is prevalent in the U.S., too. Traffickers are often ""Average Joes,"" usually in their early 30s. ""And what they're really doing,"" said Kutcher, ""is profiting off the sale of these women and girls."" These men seem like perfect guys to vulnerable girls from broken homes. Pimps start off nice and generous in a ritual that Moore likens to ""courting."" Sometimes they meet the girls online, establish relationships with them, take them shopping, make them comfortable and gain their trust. One of the so-called faces of human trafficking joined ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" under concealed identity from an undisclosed location to provide a first-hand account of what Morgan called ""the horrors of sex trafficking."" The 17-year-old girl went by the name ""Nicole"" for the purposes of the interview. When Nicole -- who is an American citizen -- was 13, her father went to jail while her mother battled drug addiction. Nicole began establishing relationships with men online, leading to a cycle of pimps, drug problems and even jail. Moore recalled the story of a girl who, now 18, was just 11 when she was taken in by a pimp. In a similar fashion, he took her to McDonald's, took her to the mall and made her feel safe. Pretty soon she was forced into child prostitution and given a $1,500-a-night quota. If she didn't meet her quota, she was beaten or forced to sit in a tub of ice. Her pimp's nickname was ""Daddy Day Care"" because the girls he overpowered were extremely young. According to the girl, Moore said, the pimp would load the girls into an overcrowded car -- so crowded that some rode in the trunk -- drive to Las Vegas, place ads on Craigslist and have the girls prostituting almost immediately. Siddharth Kara, author of ""Sex Trafficking, Inside the Business of Modern Slavery"" also joined the show. Kara said at a minimum, there are ""1.5 million traffic sex slaves in the world today generating profits in 2010 that exceeded $39 billion."" Moore reiterated that she and Kutcher initiated the campaign ""to create awareness. You have to acknowledge a problem exists before you can actually go about finding a solution,"" she said. ""And what we've found is that most people aren't even aware of what's going on."" Moore and Kutcher maintain that they will remain committed to the cause no matter how long it takes to eradicate child sex slavery. Morgan asked the couple famously addicted to Twitter -- Kutcher has 6.5 million followers, Moore has 3.5 million -- if it is smart to use social media as a tool to spread the word about their campaign when social media often makes it easier for child sex traffickers to operate. ""For me,"" said Kutcher, ""I think I looked at this platform and thought to myself, 'This could be the collective consciousness, right?' This platform, in and of itself, a little shout here, and a little shout there. But the key was being able to drive a link into deeper, richer content into a tweet, and then have that tweet be syndicated. ""I don't believe that there's a problem in the world that exists that the solutions didn't exist before the problem. So that's why we're using social media for this campaign,"" he said. ""It's to actually go right into the heart of where it's taking place. Seventy-six percent of the transactions for child sex slavery is actually happening online. So if we can motivate people while they are online to do something about that, then we can make a dent."" Furthermore, Kutcher urged people to visit sites such as Craigslist and flag pages that appear to be about child trafficking. ""People can start to actually un-root this at its root,"" said Kutcher, who urged people to go to Facebook.com/TheDNAfoundation, put themselves in a video, share that video with friends and go to the action tab where the foundation outlines online initiatives. ""We want the social web to become the police for human trafficking online,"" Kutcher told Morgan. Watch Piers Morgan Live weeknights 9 p.m. ET.

About 400 people were arrested in Oakland yesterday during a chaotic day of Occupy protests that saw demonstrators break into City Hall and burn an American flag. Police fired tear gas and used 'flash' grenades to disperse hundreds of people after some in the crowd threw rocks and bottles and tore down fencing outside a convention center. It was the most turbulent day of protests since November, when Oakland police forcefully dismantled an Occupy encampment. An exasperated Mayor Jean Quan, who faced heavy criticism for the police action last fall, called on the Occupy movement to 'stop using Oakland as its playground.' 'People in the community and people in the Occupy movement have to stop making excuses for this behavior,' she said. Clash: A policeman tries to evict Occupy Oakland protesters from the city Hall . Demonstration: Protesters on the steps of the City Hall burn a U.S. flag they found inside the building . Occupy Oakland demonstrators run over a fence in an attempt to escape from the police encirclement during the day-long protest . Authorities say protesters clashed . with police throughout the day, at times throwing rocks, bottles and . other objects at officers. The protests grew as the day wore on with an . estimated 2,000 demonstrators in the streets at one point. Most of the arrests came around 8pm, . when police took about scores of protesters into custody as they marched . through the city's downtown, with some entering a YMCA building, . according to officials. Many other demonstrators were . arrested earlier in the afternoon, after police said they threw rocks, . bottles and other objects at officers and tore down fencing. At about the same time police were . taking people into custody near the YMCA, about 100 police officers . surrounded City Hall, while others swept the inside of the building . looking for protesters who had broken into the building, then ran out of . the building with American flags before officers arrived.

Crackdown: Police used tear gas and flash grenades to try and disperse demonstrators after being hit by a stream of impromptu missiles . Arrest: Around 300 protesters were held by police after a day of widespread unrest in Oakland . Ms Quan said that at one point, many . forced their way into City Hall, where they burned flags, broke into an . electrical box and damaged several art structures, including a recycled . art exhibit created by children. More help from other police agencies . was also sent to Oakland, with busloads of Alameda County sheriff's . deputies arriving in the downtown area late Saturday. City Administrator Deanna Santana . said protesters pelted officers with bottles, metal pipes, rocks and . burning flares and police responded by deploying smoke, tear gas and . bean bag rounds. 'These demonstrators stated their . intention was to provoke officers and engage in illegal activity and . that's exactly what has occurred today,' Ms Santana said. The group assembled at a downtown . plaza yesterday morning, with demonstrators threatening to take over the . vacant Henry Kaiser Convention Center. The group then marched through . the streets, disrupting traffic. The crowd grew as the day wore on, with afternoon estimates ranging from about 1,000 to 2,000 people. A group of Occupy Oakland demonstrators climb a fence to escape arrest as riot police fought running skirmishes . Crowd: Thousands of people were estimated to have turned out for the Oakland demonstration . Response: Police were out in force in an attempt to prevent the demonstration from becoming violent . The protesters walked to the convention center, where some started tearing down perimeter fencing and . 'destroying construction equipment' shortly before 3pm, police said. Police said they issued a dispersal . order and used smoke and tear gas after some protesters pelted them with . bottles, rocks, burning flares and other objects. Most of the arrests were made when . protesters ignored orders to leave and assaulted officers, police said. By 4pm, the bulk of the crowd had left the convention center and headed . back downtown. The demonstration comes after Occupy . protesters said earlier this week that they planned to move into a . vacant building and turn it into a social center and political hub. They . also threatened to try to shut down the port, occupy the airport and . take over City Hall. In a statement on Friday, Ms Santana said the city would not be 'bullied by threats of violence or illegal activity.' Interim police chief Howard Jordan also warned that officers would arrest those carrying out illegal actions. A group of police officers arrest an Occupy Oakland demonstrator near Frank H.

In Oakland, the police department . received heavy criticism for using force to break up earlier protests. Among the critics was the mayor, Ms Quan, who said she wasn't briefed on . the department's plans. Earlier this month, a court-appointed . monitor submitted a report to a federal judge that included 'serious . concerns' about the department's handling of the Occupy protests. Tension was rising in Washington as well, where the National Park Service has said it will bar Occupy protesters in the nation's capital from camping in two parks near the White House where they have been living since October.That order, if carried out as promised on Monday, could be a blow to one of the highest-profile chapters of the movement.","Protesters break in to City Hall and burn U.S. flag found there .

For some, this means enlisting extra support to give them peace of mind, and that’s where Lipstick Investigations come into play. The Sydney based company is Australia's highest profile investigation business to specialise in infidelity, and they've been flooded with business in the New Year. Scroll down for video . Lipstick Investigations is Australia's highest profile investigation business, and they say they have been inundated with business of late . Managing director of the company David King said: 'It’s a certain type of person that will seek an investigator. Most people will see the clues and call it quits, but some need more closure' David King, the managing director of the company, told Daily Mail Australia the investigations are conducted across a number of fields. ‘We primarily deal with surveillance, but we also delve into database work and internet investigations. It varies from case to case,’ he said. Investigations typically begin with a phone call to the client, which sees the investigator ask two dozen questions to establish the plan of attack. ‘It’s a certain type of person that will seek an investigator. Most people will see the clues and call it quits, but some need more closure. It’s can also come down to cultural differences.’ A unfaithful partner caught in the act by Lipstick Investigations, who claim to have an 80 per cent success rate . King said harsh anti-surveillance laws in Australia hinder the equipment they can use on jobs, such as computer hacking and electronic tagging . Clients are charged a flat rate of $95 an hour, and while some jobs take a handful of hours, some can drag on much longer. ‘We had one client who spent half a million dollars over four years. We had plenty of evidence, but it was a drawn out case and it ended up becoming quite complicated.' King says the company also handles an array of other investigative work. ‘Private investigations are a very small industry. We take on anything from council work to companies trying to catch out employees taking a sickie.’ King said harsh anti-surveillance laws in Australia hinder the equipment they can use on jobs. ‘We’re pretty hard up. We can’t do electronic tracking, can’t hack into accounts. The office incident in New Zealand would be an ideal result for us, because that’s working within the parameters of the law.’ He said most of his results come from conventional surveillance, which includes the use of forensic tools, hidden cameras and night-vision equipment. They also arrange honey-trapping job, where a decoy is sent into partners favourite watering hole or gym to flirt with them and see what happens next, to catch out infidelity before it has even happened. The investigations include the use of use of forensic tools (pictured), hidden cameras and night-vision equipment. David King (pictured) said he takes on anything from council work to companies trying to catch out employees taking a sickie . ‘Social media has really transformed the industry. There is a drop in business because people can do the process themselves, chasing the leads of their partner on Facebook and such.’ ‘The other side of the coin is social media means there are more digital footprints left that could spark suspicion. So we can more clients from that. I think the overall workload is the same, it’s just a different dynamic.’ King says the work is consistent throughout the year, with a surge in business on certain obvious dates such as Valentine’s Day. ‘You can never put your finger on busy times. We just had the busiest January since we started our business, but I couldn’t tell you why.’ A recent study from Lonergran Research showed that one in four Australian's admits to cheating on their partner, while two-thirds of couples don’t share their deepest secrets . King says the work is consistent throughout the year, with a surge in business on certain obvious dates such as Valentine’s Day. Agent Ange. King said investigators are occasionally spotted by investigators . When asked if the investigators ever get caught in the act, King said: ‘Ultimately we’re not invisible, and we do get caught out sometimes. We can’t be ten blocks behind the suspect.’ He said investigations have about an 80 per cent success rate, but that ‘it would be a 90 per cent if clients had more money. Generally, if you have suspicions they are probably warranted.’ You can see the official Lipstick Investigations website here .","Lipstick Investigations is Australia's highest profile investigation business .

ff35d7a0a2b894f18deeb247a7199ebd4cb8465f,"(CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in China next week before international talks are held on Iran's nuclear program in Moscow, Russia's state-run RIA-Novosti news agency reported Sunday. The meeting is aimed at allowing Putin to ""feel the heat surrounding the Iranian problem and see how this issue is perceived in Tehran,"" Yuri Ushakov, a former U.S. ambassador who now serves as a Russian foreign policy adviser, told the news agency. Putin and Ahmadinejad will meet on the sidelines of the 12th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, to be held June 6-7 in Beijing. The United States, France, Russia, China, Britain and Germany -- the so-called ""P5+1, a reference to Germany plus the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- will meet in Moscow for another round of talks on Iran's nuclear program June 18-19. ""We weren't too happy with the results of the last round of talks, but we determined the mutual readiness to continue the discussion,"" Ushakov told RIA-Novosti. At the Moscow meeting, he said, Russia will ""promote the thought that Iran's right to develop peaceful energy under the oversight of the International Atomic Energy Agency should be approved."" World powers, particularly Western nations, suspect that Iran wants to build nuclear weapons, although Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Last month, during a round of talks with the P5+1 in Baghdad, Iran rejected calls to stop the high enrichment of uranium that can be used for weapons, while the international powers refused Tehran's demand for an immediate end to sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the United States and the European Union that are crippling its economy. Because 80% of Iran's foreign revenues are derived from oil exports, an embargo by the EU set to take effect in July will put further pressure on its economy. Russia historically has been hesitant to support sanctions on Tehran. In November, it called a new round of sanctions ""unacceptable,"" saying they hinder efforts to reach a diplomatic solution. ""Russia sees such extraterritorial measures as unacceptable and against international law,"" said a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, issued a day after the new sanctions were announced. ""Such a practice seriously obstructs advancement toward a constructive dialogue with Tehran. Stronger sanction pressure, which some of our partners see almost as a goal in itself, will not encourage Iran to sit down at the negotiating table."" Just after the Baghdad talks, the U.N.'s IAEA said its inspectors found a high level of enriched uranium in Iran. The nuclear watchdog agency asked Tehran to explain the presence of particles of enrichment levels up to 27% found in an analysis of environmental samples taken in February at the Fordo fuel enrichment plant near the city of Qom. The previous highest level had been 20%, typically used for hospital isotopes and research reactors. To build nuclear weapons, 90% enrichment is required. Iran said in response that the production of such particles ""above the target value"" may happen for ""technical reasons beyond the operator's control."" The IAEA said it is ""assessing Iran's explanation and has requested further details.""","The two leaders will meet next week in China, according to media reports .

ff3648d41bb273a5d0533bf0e9c6b1b341aa78dc,"Poland wants to lure 2,300 of its doctors to leave the NHS and return home. Witold Sobków, the Polish ambassador to the UK, revealed plans were being drawn up to persuade hundreds of health staff trained in Poland to return, declaring: ‘We want them back.’ He also cast doubt on proposals by Britain to limit access to benefits for EU migrants, insisting it will make little difference to the numbers of people who move to the UK in search of work and a better life. Witold Sobków, the Polish ambassador to the UK, said his country wants to attract more Polish doctors back home and dismissed the idea that benefit curbs would reduce the number of EU migrants to Britain . Around a third of the 133,000 doctors in the NHS in England Wales were trained outside the UK. Mr Sobków suggested hundreds were from Poland, and he wanted them to leave the UK and return home. ‘Of course we want them back, of course,’ he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. ‘We have lost - from what I know - 2,300 doctors in Britain. Of course they were educated in Poland for free so we want them, it is obvious. ‘We are doing our best to create conditions so that they could come back and work in Poland.’ Many in the health service argue it could not cope without the influx of qualified professionals from overseas. Almost a third of doctors working in the NHS were trained outside the UK, according to latest figures . Last month Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced dozens of extra foreign doctors had been drafted to bolster hospitals facing a winter crisis. However, Tory MP Bernard Jenkin suggested Britain did not need as many foreign workers and curbs should be introduced. ‘Germany has a very low birth rate, they need foreign workers. We don’t. ‘It has been causing real problems in hospitals, schools, has contributed to shortage of housing, we need to be able to address this in our national interest – we respect theirs, they should respect ours.’ Labour last week announced it would ban migrants from claiming out of work benefits for two years and look to curb access to in-work benefits, like tax credits. David Cameron is expected to make a speech on immigration within days in which he will also pledge to impose limits on migrants’ access to the welfare state. David Cameron is expected to announce a major crackdown on benefits for migrants within days, after Labour's Rachel Reeves announced plans to ban claims for jobseekers allowance for two years and curb access to tax credits for those in work . Latest figures show that almost 65,000 people from the EU were claiming jobseekers allowance in February this year . Latest figures show there are 64,830 EU migrants claiming jobseekers allowance in the UK, while are 252,000 working households from the EU receive tax credits. Mr Sobków insisted that attempts to limit access to these benefits would not stop Poles moving to Britain. ‘I wouldn’t say it would have an enormous effect… benefit tourism is only a small fraction of abuse of the system. ‘People don’t come here for benefits they come here for work.’ He said that there are a lot of ‘wrong assumptions’ about the motivations people have for moving to the UK . ‘One is people sit at home in Poland and start calculating how much they can lose and gain.’ ‘We have several important reasons if we decide to emigrate to other countries to work. ‘I know very wealthy people who moved to Sweden and other countries for better research laboratories. ‘The wrong assumption is the same as it was 20 years ago that we have low skilled labour, a lot of them are low skilled but a lot of them are not. ‘They are attracted because the wages are higher, not the benefits.’","Ambassador Witold Sobków says 2,300 Polish doctors are in the UK .

It describes with ‘searing honesty’ her painful struggle to come to terms with her father’s death, helped by a rather unusual companion – a hawk. Now poet and naturalist Helen Macdonald’s ‘haunting’ book H Is For Hawk has won the Costa Book of the Year Award – the first biography to win in ten years. Literary judges last night praised the part-memoir, part-nature work as ‘a unique and beautiful book with a searing emotional honesty’. It details Miss Macdonald’s journey training a baby goshawk in her small Cambridge home after the sudden loss of her photojournalist father Alisdair Macdonald. Miss Macdonald, 44, had experience of breeding and training hawks but warned in a recent interview: ‘I don’t recommend that people go and train goshawks as a way of managing grief. It’s a really terrible idea. ‘There are very few times in life when you do things that just seem necessary, even though you know to an outsider they’re a bit bewildering. 'But it was a compulsion. An extraordinary compulsion.’ Miss Macdonald, who is unmarried and has no children, added: ‘I trained the hawk because I didn’t want to be me any more. ‘I wanted to stop being a human because humans feel deep grief and emotions, and I wanted to fly away from that and become something else.’ It took the judges just an hour and a half to decide the winner of the £30,000 prize, which is one of the UK’s oldest literary awards. Chairman of the judging panel Robert Harris, himself a best-selling author, described the book as a ‘sort of modern classic’. Mr Harris also last night criticised the BBC for not running programmes dedicated to books. H Is For Hawk, Miss Macdonad’s third book, also won the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction last year. Last night Miss Macdonald, who no longer owns a goshawk but has a parrot, said: ‘It was never expected and I’m really thrilled. ‘I wanted to tell a story unflinchingly about what it is like to be very, very sad and very much miss someone that you love... It was cathartic, but I didn’t expect it to be.’ It took the judges just an hour and a half to decide the winner of the £30,000 prize, which is one of the UK’s oldest literary awards. H Is For Hawk, Miss Macdonad’s third book, also won a Samuel Johnson Prize in 2013 . Miss MacDonald's award-winning H Is For Hawk . In the part-memoir, part-nature book, Miss Macdonald describes how she was knocked sideways by the death of her father in 2007. Grief-stricken, she feels compelled to train a goshawk and, after stuffing her freezer full of hawk food, drives up to Scotland and pays a breeder £800 for Mabel, her new companion. She then begins training her in her small Cambridge home. Miss Macdonald, who had trained birds of prey before, writes: ‘I didn’t feel I had any choice. I started dreaming about goshawks and I knew I really wanted to train them and fly them. 'It was the only certain thing in my life.’ She realised her solitary life with Mabel might make an interesting book but could not write it for nearly seven years. ‘It needed that distance,’ she said. ‘When I started it, I wasn’t so confessional but it didn’t work. 'I realised I had to be truthful about what happened.’ The book has been praised for its searing honesty about her grief.","Helen Macdonald’s ‘haunting’ book  has won Costa Book of the Year Award .

ff36e1bf808bacd1c5c7cf412e93b558810740e8,"(CNN) -- A former U.S. soldier charged with attempting to join a terrorist group was sentenced to seven years in prison Monday after pleading guilty to destroying records that could be used in a terror investigation, federal prosecutors said. U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz also sentenced the ex-soldier to five years of supervised release after his prison time. Craig Benedict Baxam, 26, of Laurel, Maryland, was arrested in Kenya in December 2011 en route to southern Somalia where he planned to join al Shabaab, according to a summary of the plea agreement in a news release from U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod Rosenstein. ""Baxam told the agents that because of his prior service in the U.S. Army, and specifically his training and experience in military intelligence, he knew of the U.S. government's capabilities in tracing internet protocol addresses and other investigative techniques,"" the plea agreement states. ""Consequently, before leaving the U.S., he destroyed his personal home computer and threw the remains in a dumpster."" The news release continues: ""He told the agents that he did not want any record left behind, and that he wanted to maintain a low profile. He also said that he purchased a round trip plane ticket to Kenya rather than a one-way ticket even though he had no intention of returning to the U.S., in order not to arouse the suspicion of the FBI and U.S. military."" According to a criminal complaint, Baxam departed the United States on December 20, 2011, for Kenya, where he was arrested three days later by Kenyan authorities on suspicion of terrorism. Baxam was interviewed twice by FBI agents while in Kenyan custody and allegedly told them he wanted to join al Shabaab, live under Sharia law and never intended to leave Somalia. Baxam told the FBI he didn't have the names of any contacts in Somalia but that he ""trusted in Allah,"" the complaint said. Baxam said he was ""looking for dying with a gun in my hand"" and said he would be guaranteed a place in paradise, according to the criminal complaint. Prosecutors said at the time of his arrest that Baxam had secretly converted to Islam days before leaving the Army in July. He joined the Army in 2007 and underwent eight months of advanced training for cryptology and intelligence, according to the government. After his training, Baxam was deployed to Baghdad and to South Korea, where he separated from the service one month before the completion of his deployment. The court document did not explain how Baxam left the Army early. A law enforcement official said at the time of his arrest that there was no information to suggest Baxam had compromised any military information. Prosecutors say Baxam cashed out his retirement savings account of more than $3,600. He allegedly planned to give al-Shabaab between $600 and $700 as an offering upon his arrival, authorities said. ""FBI Special Agents in Africa, working alongside our Kenyan police partners, worked together to stop an individual who is now alleged to have been on his way to join a major terrorist group,"" said Richard McFeely, the FBI agent in charge of the Baltimore office.

ff375361612460e1360e51d19e61803677aa1f5b,"Louis Zamperini, the Olympic runner and World War II officer who survived a horrific plane crash, a seven-week journey across the Pacific in a raft, near starvation and unspeakable torture in Japanese POW camps, has died. He was 97. The cause of death was pneumonia, his family said in a statement from Universal Pictures, which is making a film adaptation of ""Unbroken,"" Laura Hillenbrand's bestselling chronicle about Zamperini's life. ""Having overcome insurmountable odds at every turn in his life, Olympic runner and World War II hero Louis Zamperini has never broken down from a challenge. He recently faced the greatest challenge of his life with a life-threatening case of pneumonia. After a 40-day long battle for his life, he peacefully passed away in the presence of his entire family, leaving behind a legacy that has touched so many lives,"" the Zamperini family said in a statement. ""His indomitable courage and fighting spirit were never more apparent than in these last days."" On her Facebook page, Hillenbrand wrote, ""Farewell to the grandest, most buoyant, most generous soul I ever knew. Thank you, Louie, for all you gave to me, to our country, and to the world. I will never forget our last, laughing talk, your singsong 'I love you! I love you!' and the words you whispered to me when you last hugged me goodbye, words that left me in happy tears, words that I will remember forever. I will love you and miss you to the end of my days. Godspeed, sweet Louie."" Angelina Jolie, the director of the ""Unbroken"" film, added, ""It is a loss impossible to describe. We are all so grateful for how enriched our lives are for having known him. We will miss him terribly."" Zamperini's tale is one of those that would be dismissed as fiction if it weren't true. A wild child who grew up in Torrance, California, he was tamed by a love for running and an unquenchable competitiveness. At 19, he ran the 5,000 meters at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin despite mere weeks of training at that distance. He missed a medal but, in his determination to catch the leaders, ran his last lap in an astonishing 56 seconds. With the 1940 Olympics canceled due to the outbreak of World War II, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps prior to Pearl Harbor and eventually became a bombardier on the sometimes unwieldy B-24 Liberator, nicknamed the ""Flying Brick."" In late May of 1943, he and a crew took off on a search mission for a fallen pilot. Somewhere over the open Pacific, the plane failed and crashed into the ocean. Zamperini and two colleagues survived, but their troubles were just beginning. He and the other crew members had to survive 47 days on a raft, in scorching sunlight and often without drinking water. They collected rain when it fell and killed albatrosses who alit on the raft. Sharks constantly circled beneath them. One person died on the journey. When Zamperini and his buddy, pilot Russell Allen ""Phil"" Phillips, finally washed ashore on a Pacific island, they found they had drifted 2,000 miles -- only to be taken in as prisoners of war by the Japanese. Life only got harder. The men were fed poorly and feared being killed by their captors. Zamperini was singled out for abuse by one camp sergeant, nicknamed ""the Bird,"" who beat him regularly in psychotic fury. Zamperini was declared dead by the U.S. military. Yet he endured. As documented in ""Unbroken,"" after the war, Zamperini struggled to adjust. He drank heavily. He had trouble sleeping. He wanted revenge on the Bird. But, thanks to a newfound faith -- inspired by visits to Billy Graham's Los Angeles Crusade in 1949 -- and an unshakable spirit, he overcame his troubles and became an inspirational speaker. He established a camp for troubled youths called Victory Boys Camp. His wife, Cynthia, was a cornerstone of his life. They were married for more than 50 years, until her death in 2001. He also forgave his wartime tormenters, some of them in person during a 1950 visit to a Tokyo prison where they were serving sentences for war crimes. He was willing to forgive the Bird, Mutsuhiro Watanabe, though Watanabe refused to meet with Zamperini when he had the chance, in 1998, when Zamperini returned to Japan to carry the torch at the Nagano Winter Games. Scott Blackmun, CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee, issued a statement offering condolences to the family and saying, ""We're proud to say that among his many accomplishments and triumphs, Mr. Zamperini was an Olympian. His fighting spirit was a true representation of Team USA and our country, both in Berlin and throughout his life. His presence will be missed."" Hillenbrand's book was released in November 2010. It remains on the bestseller lists almost four years later. Jolie's movie is scheduled to be released Christmas Day. ""It will be hard to make a film worthy of this great man,"" she told the Hollywood Reporter in 2013.

ff376e74f43ee7112d3987640b8142f0156b6606,"(CNN) -- Ramiz Rafizadeh was driving past Syria's famous Ummayad Mosque in December when another vehicle abruptly cut him off. Two men got out and shot Rafizadeh to death in front of his deaf daughter, whom he had just picked up from her school in Damascus. ""People who live in the neighborhood and witnessed the shooting talked to my mother and sister and said that the shooters were sitting in the car, waiting,"" said Rafizadeh's cousin Masoud. ""The car was carrying pro-Assad slogans, similar to the cars used by Syrian intelligence."" Rafizadeh's family wondered whether he was targeted because another cousin, Majid, is a U.S.-based Middle East scholar who has spoken out against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. But that's not the only possibility. 5 reasons Syria's war suddenly looks more dangerous . ""Even though the neighbors said the gunmen were pro-Assad, the government told us terrorists killed him,"" Masoud Rafizadeh said. And that says much about the plight of Syria's Shiite community: a minority with many enemies, including an increasingly radicalized opposition that views them as outsiders and traitors and a desperate regime that questions their loyalty. The Alawite minority that dominates the Assad regime is an offshoot of Shiite Islam, but few Syrian Shiites are among its inner circle. ""The minorities in Damascus, they are completely quiet; they don't want to side with any group. The minorities want nothing but to go to their place of worship and practice their faith."" Majid Rafizadeh tells CNN. The Syrian government views minorities, including Shiites, Christians and Kurds, as a buffer against the rebels, who in turn have tried to recruit from among these groups. But many within the rebels' ranks are wary of the Shiites, suspecting some may have links to the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, whose fighters have begun appearing in Syria on the government's side. ""(Shiites) end up being victims of a proxy war between rebels and the regime and are viewed with suspicion on both sides,"" said Abbas Barzegar, a professor of Islamic studies at Georgia State University. Barzegar says the Syrian revolution descended into civil war because of the sectarian nature of the opposition's rhetoric and its inability to control its sectarian tendencies. ""The religious diversity of Syria was once a point of pride, so the destruction of this ideal has been catastrophic,"" he said. The Rafizadeh family's tale of horrors includes a niece and a nephew wounded in a car bomb blast, relatives turned refugees, assassinated cousins, kidnapped uncles and a family trapped by fear. ""As my uncle left a funeral of a family who lost a teenage son, armed men took him and his sons by force from their car. My cousin who tried to resist was punched,"" Masoud says. Moyassar Saadi and his two adult sons were released after spending weeks as hostages of armed men claiming to be Free Syrian Army rebels. The family, however, believes the kidnappers were actually government forces posing as rebels in a bid to threaten Majid, the U.S.-based critic of the regime. Two days after his release, the 65-year-old father of four died of a heart attack. And it didn't end there. Kerry announces more aid to Syria . ""On the New Years Eve of 2013, our cousin Issam was killed. He was heading back home with groceries where he lived in Sidi Miqdad in Damascus suburbs when armed men approached and shot him dead."" Masoud says. ""The government told us that the terrorist killed Issam, and those terrorists want to kill all Syrians. Issam was not a member of the public committees or pro-government militias, he was as innocent as Hamza al-Khateeb,"" Masoud says referring to the fatal torture and mutilation of a 13-year-old boy allegedly by Syrian intelligence during the outset of the uprising. The atmosphere of chaos means many minorities simply cannot know who or what group has attacked their loved ones and why. ""You know, here in the U.S., we may ask, well, who did this? But for the families in Syria, it does not matter anymore. All they do is try and follow the kidnappers demands so they can get their relative back."" Majid says. More than 1 million Syrians are now registered refugees in neighboring countries. The Rafizadeh family longs to flee the violence but remains trapped in a capital under siege. ""I'm worried that the next target will be my mother or my sisters or my brother. I tried to get them out to Lebanon, but my mother is very sick and old; she can't walk."" Majid says. ""I try to call my family every two days to make sure everything is OK. But when I call, and they don't answer, I think someone has broken into the house and taken them or something."" he adds. Majid and Masoud are Syrian Shiites of Iranian origin. Their family comes from a lower-class neighborhood in the Old City of Damascus. ""In the Old City, we were close to different religions. We had Christians, Jewish, Sunni, Shiite. Growing up there it was more like a communal and collective society. People were always visiting each other, so there were strong ties between the families."" Majid says. The brothers and their two sisters grew up in poverty during the secular regime of Hafez al-Assad. Members of his minority Alawite group were given top government and military positions, but Assad cultivated other minorities as a counterweight to the Sunni majority. Dissent of any sort was not tolerated. While Hafez al-Assad ruled Syria, the Rafizadeh brothers' father was detained and tortured by Syrian security forces for his involvement in a human rights campaign. Majid eventually escaped the crushing poverty and oppression, receiving a Fulbright teaching scholarship in the United States. Masoud remained in Damascus, quitting school by second grade to support his family by selling memorabilia and tea to tourists. When Hafez al-Assad's British-educated son Bashar succeeded him in 2000, Syrians hoped for political and economic reforms. They never materialized, and in March 2011 came the first protests against the regime. Six months later, a radical Sunni preacher issued dire threats against minority groups that did not support the uprising. ""By Allah we will chop up their flesh and feed them to the dogs,"" Adnan al-Arour said in one of his inflammatory broadcasts on satellite station al-Wesal. As the civil war enters its third year, it is no longer a simple case of regime against rebels. There are overlapping and intersecting loyalties, foreign fighters and criminals taking advantage of chaos. ""Mounting tensions have led to armed clashes between different armed groups along a sectarian divide. Such incidents took place in mixed communities or where armed groups had attempted to take hold of areas predominantly inhabited by pro-Government minority communities."" a recent U.N. report concluded. ""The people are being very cautious of all different groups. They are afraid of all groups. They are afraid of any group outside their home."" Majid says. ""The minorities are scared because there are a lot of rumors that there are some extremist radical Sunni groups. They believe that they have distributed fliers saying if you kill one person from a minority, we will pay 100,000 Lira, and there are videos where they mutilate the person."" ""The general view is very pessimistic for the minorities; the ones who can are leaving. They are immigrating to European countries. What they hope is that the opposition and Assad can reach an agreement. They don't care about the political structure. They just want the violence to stop,"" Majid adds. But there is every sign that the violence is becoming more sectarian and even more vicious. Earlier this year, fighters from the Sunni jihadist group Nusra Front, designated a terrorist organization by the United States sang ""Just wait Allawi. We will come to slaughter you. Forget about any agreement ... We will come to slaughter you, Shiite."" The Rafizadeh family clings to the hope that a political solution can be found. ""I believe that most of the Syrians do not want to see violence in their homeland, and they want the safety and security to be back like it used to be. I don't get involved in politics and I don't want to. I want a normal life in Syria, and just want to live in peace,"" Masoud says.","Shiite family in Syria has endured attacks from all sides in civil war .
One cousin was shot dead in front of his daughter; others held hostage .
It's unclear whether attackers were with the Assad regime or the rebels .
Neither the government nor the rebels trust Shiites in Syria ."
ff37a7ff99b8c5f74b865305fce8e18433529c89,"Organisers of the inaugural Tour de Yorkshire are convinced the race has the capability to become the number one short tour on the international cycling calendar. The stages for the three-day event, a direct legacy of last summer's spectacularly successful Tour de France Grand Depart in the county, were revealed at a press conference in Bridlington on Wednesday. The east coast resort will host the start of the first stage on May 1, while the race - whose route will re-trace some sections of that used for the Tour de France - finishes in Leeds on May 3. Team Sky riders , including Chris Froome (right), cycling up a cobbled street in Haworth last summer . Gary Verity, chief executive of Welcome To Yorkshire, told Press Association Sport: 'Our aspiration for this is clear, and that is to make it the best race of its kind in the world. 'We want to do that quickly and we want to make sure for our kids and my grandkids the race goes on and on - we want to have 100 new chapters for Yorkshire, not just one. 'We said when we did the Tour de France that we wanted to host the grandest ever Grand Depart so that people from around the world would come and ask, 'How did you do that?' The Grand Depart in Yorkshire last summer created fantastic scenes as thousands turned out to watch . 'We want to do that again this this race. We want to do it in such a way that people say, 'Look, if you're doing a short bike race, which is the best on the planet?' And we want them to say the Tour de Yorkshire.' After leaving Bridlington, stage one will weave up the east coast towards Scarborough before cutting through Dalby Forest towards Pickering and up over the North Yorkshire Moors to Whitby, from where it will return down the coast to Scarborough. Stage two, which has been designed with sprinters in mind, will start in Selby and include Beverley and Malton on its itinerary before finishing with a circuit of the city in York, which hosted the start of stage two of the Tour de France. Team Sky reach the summit at Holme Moss Moor in Yorkshire during stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France . Stage three from Wakefield will head through Barnsley before re-living the iconic Tour de France sight of a charge up the Haworth cobbles. It will re-trace much of the Tour de France route in reverse as it descends Cragg Vale on its way to the finish at Roundhay Park. The race has been jointly organised by Welcome To Yorkshire and the Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), which is responsible for the Tour de France. Tour de France Sports Director Thierry Gouvenou, who designed the race route, said: 'Yorkshire offers so much with its huge variety of landscapes. 'For this first edition we have three quite different stages, each with their own challenges and seen as a whole, a very exciting addition to European racing.' The inaugural Tour de Yorkshire will follow the same route as last summer's three Grand Depart stages . Rotherham-born Team Sky sprinter Ben Swift said he is relishing the opportunity of racing in front of his home fans after missing out on the opportunity to take part in last year's Tour de France. Swift said: 'It was disappointing not to make the cut for the Tour de France especially as it was going through roads I trained and grew up on - but the legacy of Tour de Yorkshire is brilliant. 'I had mixed feelings watching the Tour de France on TV - I was tired after a long season so it was nice to sit at home, but it was also hard to watch in the knowledge that I was missing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity. 'All this makes up for that a bit. It is a follow-on from how successful cycling has become in Britain and with the level it is coming in at it is just going to be a hit straight away.'","Yorkshire hosted the first three stages of the 2014 Tour de France .

ff38602b7362c7ac46761127db01ce786c8c330c,"By . Darren Boyle . Former snooker star Stephen Lee, pictured, was fined £1,185 at Swindon Magistrates' Court after he admitted on count of fraud after he failed to send a cue he had sold to one of his fans to the buyer . Disgraced snooker player Stephen Lee is living on benefits after being banned from the sport for match-fixing, a court heard. Details of Lee's fall from grace came to light after he pleaded guilty to a charge of fraud at Swindon Magistrates' Court over the sale of his personal snooker cue. The court heard Lee, of Trowbridge, Wiltshire, agreed to sell his John Parris Ultimate to fan Marco Fai Pak Shek, based in Hong Kong, through Facebook for £1,600. But despite Mr Shek paying the money into the bank account of Lee's wife, the cue never arrived - and 39-year-old Lee continued to use it. Lee insisted he had always meant to send the cue but was distracted after becoming 'embroiled in a number of difficulties' relating to his professional life. Earlier this month, Lee was ordered to pay a total of £125,000 in costs after failing in his appeal to overturn a 12-year ban from snooker for match fixing. The five-time ranking tournament winner and former number world five was handed the ban after a 2013 tribunal found him guilty of fixing seven games in 2008 and 2009. Today magistrates ordered Lee to pay £1,815 after he entered a guilty plea to the charge of fraud by false representation between July 1 2013 and January 21 this year. John Fryer, chairman of the bench, told Lee the fine would be deducted from the £133 he receives in benefits every fortnight. 'In . arriving at our sentence at this matter, we have taken into account a . number of things - your previous good character, you have not appeared . before the courts before, and we have given you credit for your early . guilty plea,' Mr Fryer said. Mr Lee, pictured, told the court that he was unable to pay the £1,800 fine immediately as he has been living on benefits since he was banned for 12 years from playing snooker following a match fixing allegation . 'We also note that you are on benefits and your income is significantly lower.' Lee was fined £110 for the offence and told to pay Mr Shek £1,600 in compensation, along with £85 prosecution costs and a £20 victim surcharge. When asked if he could pay the £1,815 fine immediately, Lee replied: 'I can't pay that today, no.' Mr Fryer made a collection order for the amount, telling Lee: 'If the payments stop, someone will be knocking on your door.' Lee's appeal against his 12-year ban was thrown out by Nicholas Stewart QC earlier this month, with his original costs order also increased from £40,000 to £75,000. Lee, pictured, was ordered to pay £125,000 in costs after failing to overturn his 12-year snooker ban for match fixing in what the game's governing body called 'the worst case of corruption it had ever seen' The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association described his actions as 'the worst case of corruption' it had ever seen, while Lee said he was 'devastated' by the penalty. Prosecutor Michelle Hewitt told magistrates Lee offered his personal snooker cue for sale to Mr Shek for £1,600 and agreed for modifications to be made. 'But following the transfer of the funds, the defendant failed to send the snooker cue or make any arrangements for the modifications to be carried out as agreed,' Ms Hewitt said. 'When there was no sign of the snooker cue, a report was made to the police. They carried out an investigation and arrested the defendant. 'The defendant was still using the cue as his own personal property.' Following Mr Shek's formal complaint, made to police on January 24 this year, Lee sent the victim an email promising to 'personally deliver' the cue to Hong Kong. The email read: 'If you want the cue, you need to drop the charges and I will sign some pictures for you,' the court heard. Lee took to his Facebook page, pictured, to explain to a supporter that he was 'gutted' by the court appearance. He claimed that he had intended travelling to Hong Kong to deliver the cue personally . However, Mr Shek refused to drop the charges and the case against Lee continued. Representing Lee, Mark Glendenning said his client had repeatedly apologised to Mr Shek for failing to send the cue. He said the sale was arrange through Lee's Facebook page, where he had previously sold items to fans 'without incident'. Lee attempted to arrange for work to be carried out on the snooker cue but became distracted with issues in his personal and professional life, he explained. 'Life took over, Mr Lee found himself embroiled in a number of difficulties which have been much publicised in relation to his career and that took a great deal of his time and energy,' Mr Glendenning said. 'He accepts in full he should have sent this cue, the difficulty being with his personal life impacting on his professional life. 'There was an intention to send that cue to Hong Kong but things took over and it didn't get there.' Lee, who wore a black t-shirt, black jacket and jeans to court, did not wish to comment outside the courtroom . However, a message appeared on Stephen Lee's Facebook page stating that he was 'gutted'. The message read: 'Well the guilty plead (sic) was honest as I took the money from a fan and I new (sic) that I had a plan to be out in hong kong in march to meet with him my self and hand the cue over and have a frame with him.....' In reply to a comment of support, he added: 'I'm just gutted ......'","Shamed snooker star Stephen Lee agreed to sell the cue to a fan for £1,600 .

Damien Baxendale was jailed for 10 years after he left 23-year-old Chelsea Hayes unconscious, her clothing torn and blood splattered around the rooms at his flat in Bolton, Greater Manchester. She was so badly swollen her three-year-old daughter, Shernia, did not recognise her and she now suffers from back pain, headaches, nausea, dizziness, poor memory and depression. Rachel White, prosecuting, told Bolton Crown Court that a neighbour saw the 24-year-old outside his flat at 3am on August 3 last year, kicking someone in the face 'as if he was kicking a football'. When police officers arrived, Baxendale refused to let them in, claiming Miss Hayes was asleep, but relented when they threatened to force their way in. Miss White told the court: 'Inside was covered with blood all over and it looked as if a struggle had taken place. 'Chelsea Hayes was severely injured, gagging and unconscious.' Baxendale claimed Miss Hayes had been drunk telling police it was 'all her own fault' and claiming she had banged her head. While his girlfriend lay unconscious in hospital Baxendale told officers: 'When she wakes up she will verify everything I have said.' The court heard Miss Hayes spent 10 days in hospital and could not remember anything about that night. Chelsea Hayes, 23, pictured left after her attack and right, bruised and swollen after she was beaten by her boyfriend Damien Baxendale. She had a bleed on the brain and needed her eye socket reconstructed . Miss Hayes had to have a metal plate installed in her cheek bone to reconstruct her face and surgeons went in via her eye socket, which is now scarred (pictured) Miss White said: 'It is the kind of injury usually seen in road traffic collisions.' He left her with a bleed on the brain, two fractured vertebrae, a fractured eye socket which had to be reconstructed, damaged neck ligaments, black eyes and lips so swollen she could not open her mouth. The court heard Baxendale was granted bail in February this year but almost exactly a year later, on August 2 he was arrested again after a violent street attack on another girlfriend. At 5am a resident called police after seeing Baxendale kick the woman in the side and repeatedly punch her in the face. Her injuries included a fractured nose and bruised and swollen face. Baxendale, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm with intent and causing grievous bodily harm.

Colin Buckle, defending, said his client 'knows he does not deserve the clemency of the court'. Baxendale was jailed for ten years, with a further four on licence for the attack and second violent assault. Judge Peter Davies said: 'They were savage, brutal, ferocious and frenzied assaults.' He told him that he regarded him as a dangerous offender who posed a serious risk to the public and he did not accept he was remorseful.

The extent to which junk mail and nuisance phone calls had taken over my life became clear during one hellish day when I felt as though I was under siege in my own home. On this day, my letterbox seemed to open and snap shut every 15 minutes with some leaflet or other offering a service I didn’t need. When the junk mail wasn’t disturbing the peace, my mobile and landline were ringing with calls claiming I was due a small fortune in PPI and accident compensation or from call centres asking me to take part in endless surveys. Deck the hall with junk: Claudia with her stacks of unwanted mail . It all added up to an incredibly stressful day when I was unable to get any work done. Certainly it’s a problem that has become part and parcel of modern life, but what made it all the more frustrating was that I take every step I can to ensure I’m not targeted. I refuse to join mailing lists, I untick boxes asking if I’d like to be sent special offers, my phone number is ex-directory and I’m registered with the TPS (telephone preference service). Clearly, though, these weren’t working. So, with a mixture of sheer frustration and morbid curiosity, I decided on that day in November last year to keep a running total of all my junk mail and nuisance calls for 12 months. My experiment came to an end at the beginning of this month and the outcome is staggering. Over the past year I have experienced 4,481 unwelcome intrusions into my life in the form of unsolicited post, spam emails, phone calls and texts. Of all these intrusions, it’s the junk mail that I find the most infuriating. Deluge: 17.5billion pieces of junk mail are distributed in Britain every year . On a bad day, leaflets start dropping through my letterbox as early as 6am and can continue until as late as 10pm. Sometimes, I’ll come home after a day out to find a dozen pieces of paper strewn across my floor. Every year around 17.5 billion pieces of junk mail, addressed and unaddressed, are distributed across the country. The average householder receives 453 of them. On Tuesday, the Mail ran the story of Rebecca George, 44, a graphic designer from Hackney, East London, who collected 1,027 pieces of junk mail in a year. Well,  guess what? I can do better than that. I received nearly treble the national average. This year, 1,147 items of junk were delivered to me. My house is in a part of South London known for its young families and high-earning professionals. And even though I don’t slot into either category, it means that if I look out of my window I rarely have to wait more than a few minutes before I see a leaflet distributor. My tally included 91 cards from taxi firms, 76 freesheets and newspapers and 42 envelopes and bags from charities. There were also 159 takeaway menus - a third from Pizza Hut and Dominos, who rarely went a week without reminding me of their latest offers. Endless: Spam email traffic is never-ending, and practically impossible to stem . As the value of properties in my area has risen by 25 per cent in the past year, estate agents are keen to make their presence known. There have been 123 communications, including 30 addressed to me by name from agents who, presumably, had identified me on the electoral roll. I also received 309 flyers from companies offering every kind of service you can imagine from cleaning and gardening to baby-sitting and dog walking. Religious groups including the Church of Scientology and Jehovah’s Witnesses left their calling cards, as did one gentleman calling himself ‘Mr Mahuba the Witchdoctor’ who, for a small fee, would place lifelong curses on my enemies. On more than one occasion I wondered how much he’d charge for performing a little voodoo on Pizza Hut or Foxtons estate agents. My local authority, Lambeth, has failed to see the irony of leafleting me on 24 occasions about my duty to recycle and dispose of my mail responsibly. Of the half a million tonnes of junk mail generated in Britain every year, around a fifth ends up going to landfill sites at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £50 million. Then there is the damage to the environment. It takes 17 trees to produce each tonne of junk mail. In the past year, there were only eight blissful days out of 365 when I didn’t receive a single flyer. At the beginning of this year, I stuck a ‘no junk mail please’ sticker to my letterbox. A fortnight later I removed it when I realised it was making things worse. Hefty load: Half of a postman's bag will be made up of junk, which is worth £1.1billion a year to the Royal Mail . Some mischievous distributors were taking it as a sign to dump a handful of flyers on me in one go. When I pointed out the sticker to one young man who was about to deliver literature from a removal company, he just shrugged and said ‘no understand English’. Increasingly, it isn’t just the door-to-door leaflet-droppers responsible for junk mail. A vast amount is delivered by Royal Mail. In the past 12 months it delivered 226 letters and promotional mail items from companies trying to sell me everything from wine, holidays to insurance, clothes and furniture. Ludicrously, the companies who harassed me the most were the ones whose services I already used. So much for their expensive consumer research departments! Sky Television wrote to me 26 times trying to sell me more expensive packages or get me to switch phone provider. BT also wrote to me 16 times about their broadband or new TV sports channels. But as any Sky or BT customer knows, when you have a problem with their products and really need to make contact, you’ve got more chance of getting through to the Prime Minister than you have of speaking to someone who can help. I also received 63 letters from energy companies wanting me to switch my supply to them or simply justifying why they are sticking up their prices yet again. Thirty-three banks and credit companies wrote offering loans and balance transfers. Not surprisingly, half a postman’s sack will be made up of junk post - with the Royal Mail delivering  3.3 billion items a year. Though it offers households the chance to opt out of receiving unaddressed junk mail, since it depends on £1.1 billion a year of such business, it doesn’t make it well known. No wonder less than 1 per cent of homes have joined the scheme. I did, however, think that registering my mobile and home phones with the Telephone Preference Service would stop nuisance calls - and until about two years ago, it did. The service is free and it means that your number is put on a national register that marketing and telesales companies are meant to check and not contact anyone whose name appears on it. While reputable companies abide by the rules, a growing number of rogue ones do not. Unstoppable: Claudia was bombarded with more than triple the average amount of junk mail . It is for that reason, I assume, that over the past year I received 137 nuisance calls and 72 texts. Some of the phone calls, particularly those from Indian-based call centres, came as early as 5am, while texts pinged up any time of the day or night. The vast majority were from companies wrongly claiming I was owed PPI compensation or a pay-out after an accident. I also received 40 ‘silent calls’. These are from companies using ACS (Automated Calling Systems). Targeted phone numbers are randomly chosen and automatically dialled. If you answer and an agent is available you’ll be connected. But if you answer and no agent is free, the line just goes dead. A rather intimidating thing at 2am. During September, a company calling itself UK Lifestyle, but using Indian call centre staff, called me 14 times asking me to take part in pointless surveys. I’d refuse, ask them not to call again and an hour later they’d ring back as if they’d never spoken to me before. When it comes to text messages, texting ‘STOP’ to one of the PPI companies is the worst thing you can do. It simply informs them your number is in use and leads to a flurry of additional messages. The problem of nuisance calls and texts has become so huge, with seven out of ten people receiving them, that consumer watchdog Which? has launched a ‘Calling Time’ campaign asking the Government to get tough on organisations that harass people in their homes. Richard Lloyd of Which? says: ‘Unwanted calls or texts are not just a nuisance, they can be intrusive and distressing. 'Many of us have been bombarded with spurious claims of PPI or injury compensation, and people are fed up with this nuisance and want to see action. ‘We want regulators to work together to police and punish those responsible. If they are unwilling or unable to enforce the rules, the Government should step in.’ But the award for the biggest pest of all goes to the email spammers. In the past year, I have received 3,125 junk emails - that’s despite using the highest possible security filters. From the Nigerian scammers telling me I’ve inherited millions to Canadian pharmacies wanting to sell me Viagra, the emails arrived at a rate of nine a day. What I can do to reduce the spam? Apparently, not a lot. Internet security expert Sam Maccherola says: ‘Once your email address is publicly available online or on an illegal list, the genie cannot be put back in the bottle.’ And as with the junk text messages, opting to unsubscribe will only alert spammers to the fact your email address is active, and you’ll be targeted even more. With my own Project Junk at an end, I will shortly be taking my ten giant bin bags full of leaflets and letters to the recycling centre - and, sadly, bracing myself for the even bigger deluge that 2014 is bound to bring.","Claudia tries to avoid spam, but still had 4,481 junk messages in 2013 .

ff39445a3b1f04929964ee6ef1c2e97a28ca24aa,"FIFA president Sepp Blatter has ruled out revisiting the vote for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups after the world governing body's executive committee agreed unanimously that an 'appropriate' form of the Garcia report should be published. Blatter said in a statement that 'external legal experts' supported the view that 'there are no legal grounds' to revoke the controversial vote in 2010 to award the World Cups to Russia and Qatar. FIFA's executive committee agreed unanimously that an 'appropriate' form of the report into World Cup bidding by Michael Garcia, the ethics investigator who resigned earlier this week, should be published but with names and other details removed. The report into corruption by Michael Garcia will be published, the FIFA ExCo have decided . Officials at a meeting in Morocco agreed to the proposal without a vote being taken - but nothing will be published until the ethics committee charges against three FIFA ExCo members - Angel Villar Llona of Spain, Belgium's Michel D'Hooghe and Thailand's Worawi Makudi - have been dealt with. Blatter said at a news conference: 'The famous Garcia report is no longer such a timely matter. At the current time, there is no reason to go back on our decisions. The decision of December 2010 stands.' 'We need to ensure that we respect the rules of our organisation and that we do not breach confidentiality in a way that will prevent people from speaking out in the future. 'The two World Cups are in the calendar, the only thing missing is the precise dates for 2022, but these two World Cups will take place,' said Blatter. 'It would really need an earthquake, extremely important new elements to go back on this World Cup in Qatar.' FIFA president Sepp Blatter (centre) was in favour of Garcia's report being published . American lawyer Garcia produced a 430-page report into the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. He quit on Wednesday as FIFA's ethics investigator after losing his appeal challenging the findings to clear Russia and Qatar to host the World Cups. The FIFA ExCo meeting was given a presentation by Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's audit and compliance committee, who suggested the report should be published in an 'appropriate form' - with all names and other details redacted. This was agreed to by the members without a vote - though it is understood there were some strong views expressed questioning how much of the report should be made public. Blatter said in a statement: 'The report is about history and I am focused on the future. We will not revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote and a report by independent, external legal experts commissioned by Mr Scala supports the view that there are no legal grounds to revoke the executive committee's decision on the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.' Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce, from Northern Ireland, welcomed the move to publish the report in some form. But Blatter said there were no legal grounds to revisit the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups . He said: 'I am pleased the the FIFA executive committee decided without a vote to publish this report. It shows that people at FIFA at the moment do desire transparency and the sooner we can get on with talking about the game of football that we all love, the better.' FIFA's ExCo appointed Zurich-based Swiss lawyer Cornel Borbely to replace Garcia in an acting capacity. Borbely had been Garcia's deputy and took charge of the investigation into the Russian and American bids. Borbely's main task will be to take over the cases of FIFA ExCo members Villar Llona, D'Hooghe and Makudi, who all had proceedings opened against them by Garcia for either alleged code breaches during the 2018/2022 bidding process or for failing to comply with his investigations. Garcia had also opened proceedings against former ExCo member Franz Beckenbauer, the former Germany player and coach, and Harold Mayne-Nicholls, the head of FIFA's inspection team which compiled a technical report on the countries bidding for 2018 and 2022. FIFA also confirmed that a final decision on the timing of the 2022 World Cup will be taken in March - November/December 2022 remains the most likely time in order to avoid the extreme heat of the summer. The FIFA ExCo have also announced they will scrap age limits for international referees . The last meeting of the task force looking at the dates will take place in Doha, Qatar, on February 23. The executive committee also supported the creation of an independent body to oversee a programme to improve workers' rights in Qatar. Blatter also took the opportunity to stress again that he would be standing for a fifth term of office on May 29 next year against as yet unknown definite opponents. 'I trust in myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here,' he said. 'Probably you will see my name because I have been asked by a lot of national federations. Football needs leadership.' Meanwhile, new rules banning third party ownership of players will come into force on May 1 next year, though existing agreements will be permitted until a player's contract expires. In other decisions, the ExCo agreed to scrap the age limit of 45 for referees - officials instead will have to take an annual fitness test. Prize money for the women's World Cup will rise by 50 per cent, from 10million US dollars (£6.4m) in 2011 to 15m US dollars (£9.6m) in 2015, with 2m US dollars (£1.28m) going to the winning team.","FIFA voted to publish Michael Garcia's World Cup bidding report .

ff397a39a0e5019c4f945bb4b4cca991fc9ef2f5,"More than a year ago, Steve Carter was browsing online and came across a missing children's website. To his astonishment, after clicking through the pages, he found himself. What followed was a yearlong story of self-discovery. Carter, a 35-year-old software salesman, was adopted at age 4 from an orphanage in Honolulu. When he grew up, got married and thought about having his own children, the Philadelphia resident grew more curious about his own roots. ""CNN covered Carlina White's story. It popped up on my iPad, and right from there I went to the center's website,"" Carter said, referring to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. White, an Atlanta woman who made headlines last year after she found her own baby picture on the website, discovered that she had been kidnapped as a 3-week-old infant from a Harlem hospital in 1987 by a woman posing as a nurse. She reunited with her biological family in an emotional meeting last January. Reading White's tale, Carter said, made him wonder about his own. On a hunch, he clicked on Missingkids.com in hopes of answering the unanswered questions about his origins. It was there he found an age-progression image made from a photograph of him as an infant. Carter recognized himself immediately, he said, and contacted the Honolulu Police Department. ""I let them know my info and they ran with it,"" he said. ""They were the ones who did all the legwork"" of investigating the case. Carter then volunteered for a DNA test in February 2011. Eight months later its findings revealed fragments of his story and the name he'd been given at birth: Marx Panama Moriarty Barnes. His biological father, Mark Barnes, reported him missing more than three decades ago after his mother, Charlotte Moriarty, took him for a walk and didn't return. Carter says he believes Moriarty put him in the Hawaiian orphanage and told authorities his name was Tenzin Amea. CNN could not independently confirm that account. Barnes, who now lives in California with his two daughters, was not immediately available for comment, and Moriarty's whereabouts are unknown. This January, Carter decided to contact his newfound relatives over the phone. ""They knew I had been located, but they were very surprised,"" Carter said, describing the experience as ""a lot to digest."" ""You see a lot of these reunion stories and a day later they're meeting their parents,"" he said. ""I'm still going forward, testing the waters."" Carter says that while he intends to meet his kin at some point, he also wants to uncover what happened in the three-week period between his reported disappearance and his arrival at the orphanage in Hawaii. And yet authorities say stories like Carter's and White's are rare. Thousands of children under the age of 18 go missing each year, the center for missing children reported. Many of those youths are considered runaways and return home, though hundreds of the long-term missing often prove far more difficult to track down. ""We encourage folks who have doubts to look on the website,"" said Robert Lowery, the center's executive director. Carter described his experience as ""a happy ending to a story that usually isn't a happy ending."" ""Good things do happen,"" he said.","Steve Carter, 35, was adopted at age 4 from an orphanage in Honolulu.

This is the terrifying moment the engine of a microlight suddenly cuts out at 300ft - forcing the rookie pilot into an emergency landing in a field. Aviator John Merriman, 53, of Somerton, Somerset, was cruising at 50 knots over the countryside when he was confronted by the life-or-death emergency. The engine on his two-seater XAir microlight stopped, bringing the propeller to a juddering halt and filling the cockpit with an eery silence. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

But the ground rushes rapidly towards him as the microlight falls like a stone - with overhead power lines directly in its path. Judging that he won't make it over the cables, John dips the nose at the last minute and crash-lands at almost 50 mph, just feet from a herd of cows.

Mr Merriman, who has only been flying for six months and has 30 hours recorded time in the air, said: 'I told myself ""Don't panic - remember your training"". 'It was pretty hair-raising but I had no choice - you've only got one shot at doing it right or you're in big trouble.

ff3ae82c0aa65da2b58a0277e6f3d6ccb07cd744,"It looks like a glittering golden palace fit for a Russian tsar, and its appearance on the Moscow property market is perhaps a sign of the crisis facing the super-rich amid the rouble's collapse. With nine sumptuous bedrooms, Baroque-style living areas and two swimming pools - as well as being decorated with gold throughout - this home looks almost too lavish for royalty. Chandeliers hang from the ceilings and every room is fitted with exclusive custom-made ornate furniture, with the mansion sitting amid towering pine trees in its own 97 acres. Scroll down for video . Fit for an oligarch: This sumptuous palace is for sale in Moscow's most elite suburb - and is only the third most expensive on the market . Luxury: The £70million estate has 97 acres of pine forest and custom-made furniture, with copious amounts of decorative gold throughout . Excess: The luxury of the mansion, including its snooker room, is a testament to the eye-watering wealth of some in post-Soviet Russia . But all this luxury comes at a price, with only billionaire oligarchs - many of whom have suffered mega losses due to the rouble fall - likely to be able to afford the hefty $109 million (£70 million) price tag. Located in Russia's 'Beverly Hills', it is described by estate agents as being 'in the style of the country estates of the European aristocracy'. The identity of the seller is not disclosed. In its sales material Sotheby's International Realty states: 'The interiors are reminiscent of Baroque palaces. 'The rooms have a lot of gold, natural stone and precious wood. In some rooms the floors are made of natural marble and the billiard room and library are solid oak and mahogany.' The 'golden palace' is located in the prestigious Rublyovka suburb in Moscow, where A-listers reside and property prices are some of the highest in the world. Snug: One of the house's nine bedrooms is themed entirely in red, black and gold, even down to the colours of the wooden floor . Luxury: The walk-in shower, set on a central marble plinth, is big enough for an oligarch and a few mistresses for good measure . Tub: Even the bathrooms do not escape the marble, chandeliers and gold. The collapse of the rouble raises doubts over the home's future . Panelling: The study has hints of James Bond. The suburb of Rublyovka, where the mansion is, became a Beverly Hills in the 1990s . Entertaining: Should you buy the palace, there is ample enough room to invite round all your oligarch friends for caviar and fizz . The three-storey main residence, which has similarities to a modern French chateau, has 2,300 square metres of living space. Inside, the bedrooms are particularly notable, with each one dripping in gold and decorated in a different style. Some feature four-poster beds, while others boast expensive works of art on the walls, but all resemble presidential suites in luxury hotels. One of the main living areas contains a grand piano, while the spa and massage zone has hints of Arabia about its decor. Swimmers taking advantage of the larger indoor swimming pool will notice the Sistine Chapel-esque painting on the ceiling. The mansion comes completely fully-furnished, with some of the pieces made by European cabinet makers. Rublyovka, in pleasant woodland on one side of the Moscow River, became a Russian equivalent of Beverly Hills in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union. The western suburb quickly became home to billionaire oligarchs, showbusiness stars, government officials and industry tycoons. Bedecked: The mansion comes completely fully-furnished, with some of the pieces made by European cabinet makers . Arabesque: There are hints of the exotic in the house's swimming pool and spa rooms, with patterned tiles and teapots . Entertaining: In the dining room, it's difficult to check one's reflection in the mirror on the left without an expensive vase getting in the way . Reception room: With thick padded walls, the space where guests are invited for an introductory drink has the air of a Swiss bank vault . Welcome: The entrance hall boasts one of the house's most opulent chandeliers, dangling over a central table and viewing gallery . As well as expensive properties, the area also boasts exclusive boutique shops and sports clubs frequented by the rich and famous. As an indication of the exclusivity of the neighbourhood, the golden palace is not even the most expensive on the market, with others commanding higher prices. Ilya Menzhutov, director of the elite real estate company Metrium Grupp, said: 'It is by far not the most expensive house in Rublyovka. 'As of today, there is at least two houses that outrun the mansion in price. One of them is $130million (£85million) and the other is $150 million (£98million). 'Moreover, the most expensive estate is not in the famous Rublyovka but off the Skolkovskoye highway, where the buyer will have to pay $200 million (£130million).' The house is not even the most expensive one for sale in the elite neighbourhood - others are priced at £85million and £98million . Golden: The rise of the super-rich in Russia was at its peak in the 1990s as former nationalised industries were sold to private investors . Music: One of the rooms has a grand piano with wooden inlays, in case the creative urge decides to hit the home's wealthy owner . Some of the bedrooms boast expensive works of art on the walls, and all resemble presidential suites in luxury hotels in the west . As well as the mansion (pictured), the area also boasts exclusive boutique shops and sports clubs frequented by the rich and famous . Estate agents in Moscow are divided on how well such homes will sell at the moment, particularly amid the rouble crisis and Russia's slide towards recession. In its November review on the premium market, before the latest slump, IntermarkSavills suggested that the fall of the currency was becoming critically important. After its collapse, the official rate is around 60 roubles to the dollar. Many estate agents are now advertising their prices in dollars - or setting a fixed rate of 37 to 45 roubles to the dollar, said Nina Reznichenko, the head of suburban real estate department at IntermarkSavills. 'Clients have also reacted to such dramatic changes almost immediately: negotiations are getting longer, and the majority of purchases are made in below $2million segment.'. Tweed estate agents say the buyers of the most expensive properties have been put off by the currency problems. Just a few miles away in Moscow's supermarkets, the nation's economic woes take a very different form - with shelves stripped bare thanks to economic sanctions. Russia has banned cheese imports from nations which are imposing sanctions - including Germany, the Netherlands, France, Poland and Lithuania - and chicken imports from the U.S. amid growing international tension over its involvement in Ukraine. Meanwhile, in real life: Bare Moscow supermarket shelves yesterday after Russia banned imports from sanction-imposing countries .

Back in jail: Joseph Green Brown, 62, is being held over the murder of his wife Mamie in North Carolina last week after he was released from death row in 1987 . A former death row inmate who became a spokesman against the death penalty has been arrested again over the alleged murder of his wife. Joseph Brown was held after Mamie, his wife of 20 years, was found dead in her apartment on Thursday. He now faces the death penalty for the second time if convicted of the crime which has left both their families in shock. Officers found the 71-year-old woman lying on the floor suffering from apparent trauma. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Brown was released from death row in 1987 for a wrongful rape and murder conviction and spent his life campaigning for reform of the penal system. He found God, took the name Shabaka and frequently spoke out against the finality of the death penalty, including a passionate speech to a Congressional Judiciary subcommittee. Prominent lawyers involved in his case also changed their minds about capital punishment due to his pleas. In one interview Brown said: ‘I’m against killing, period, whether the violence is by individuals, the state, or armies in warfare. All life is sacred.’ The body of Mrs Brown, 71, was discovered after police were asked to check on her. Her husband was arrested late on Friday at a hotel in Charleston, South Carolina. Back on death row: Joseph Green Brown, right, is again on death row for the alleged murder of his wife of 20 years, 71-year-old Mamie Caldwell Brown, left, was found dead last week . Discovery: Mamie Brown, 71, was found dead at her apartment in North Carolina after having suffered trauma, according to police . During his first court appearance in . Charlotte, North Carolina, he was escorted into a courtroom in . handcuffs. Wearing an orange prison jump suit, he glimpsed at his wife’s . family in the courtroom, but quickly turned away. A daughter of the victim could be heard saying: ‘Oh my god!’ Marcus Williams, Mrs Brown’s cousin, . said: ‘We thought they were happy. He didn’t seem like a threat. He was . upfront about everything. He was always smiling and trying to help . people.' Mr Williams added: ‘He was a motivational speaker. He liked to warn people what could happen in the legal system’. Brown’s 1974 conviction and death . sentence by a Florida jury was for raping and murdering Earlene Treva . Barksdale, the owner of a clothing store. He was scheduled for execution October  17, 1983, but a federal judge ordered a stay 15 hours before he was to be put to death. Mrs Barksdale, 34, a mother of five, . was found shot in the head at the children's clothing store she owned on . July 7, 1973 by her husband Fred, according to an article by Cltampa.com . Her . husband was considered the prime suspect for around five days before he . passed a lie detector test and attention shifted to Joseph Brown. Brown, at the time a 23-year-old . drifter from South Carolina, had just confessed to a motel robbery where . he sexually abused a female guest near Tampa airport on the same . day. He denied knowing anything about Mrs Barksdale's death. Brown was convicted of her murder the . following year and spent 13 years on death row before charges were . dropped just 15 hours before his execution. He was released on March 5, 1987 after an appeals court found that prosecution had allowed testimony at trial they knew to be false. One witness had struck a deal with the prosecution and falsely told the court that he and Brown had committed a robbery together. Grisly: Joseph Green Brown had been convicted of the rape and murder of Earlene Barksdale in 1973 but was released from death row . In a 1997 interview with America magazine about his experiences on death row, Brown said: 'Overall, it took me almost five years to decompress from the experience on death row. 'Some people couldn't believe I was still alive.' Among those who campaigned for Brown the first time around was Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut based lawyer who is now a Senator for the state. He worked the case pro bono and even put in $40,000 of his own money - despite supporting the death penalty. He declined to comment on Brown’s latest arrest. Some $400,000 of money for Brown’s defence was also provided by black rights campaigners the NAACP because they believed it was a racially-linked injustice. North Carolina, where Brown will face justice this time, has the death penalty for capitol felonies, of which first degree murder is one. The last execution in the state was Samuel Flippen in 2006 who beat his two-year-old stepdaughter to death.","Joseph Brown, 62, being held without bond over murder of wife Mamie, 71 .

ff3b62b96ad45e038aa8b8985f212466857e0ccc,"By . Jenny Hope . PUBLISHED: . 18:05 EST, 19 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:14 EST, 19 May 2013 . Vitamin D could help asthma patients breathe more easily, claim British researchers. Scientists at King’s College London have discovered vitamin D has the potential to significantly cut the symptoms of sufferers. They say it may one day be prescribed as a treatment alongside conventional steroids, but reducing the need for medication. Discovery: Vitamin D helps reduce the symptoms of asthma and could be used with steroids in future . A new study found the ‘sunshine’ vitamin resulted in lower levels of a natural chemical in the body that aggravates symptoms in asthma patients and cuts the effectiveness of steroids. More than five million Britons suffer asthma, including 1.4 million children, and the disease causes 1,400 deaths each year. Asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways, causing them to constrict and resulting in attacks of breathlessness and wheezing which can be fatal. Severe asthma is currently treated with steroid tablets which can have harmful side effects. Many sufferers have a steroid resistant variation of the condition making it even more difficult to treat and putting them at greater risk of hospitalisation from severe, even life-threatening, asthma attacks. In a study funded by Asthma UK . charity, a team of scientists at King’s identified a mechanism through . which Vitamin D can reduce asthma symptoms, providing a potential target . for future treatments. IL -17A is a natural chemical which . helps to defend the body against infection, but is known to exacerbate . asthma and reduce responsiveness to steroids when produced in larger . amounts. Experiments: Scientists at King's College London conducted the study into how the vitamin could be used . The team examined the production of IL-17A and levels of the chemical in cells from 18 steroid resistant asthma patients and 10 patients who responded to steroids, as well as a control group of 10 healthy people. Results showed that patients with asthma had much higher levels of IL-17A than those without asthma and patients with steroid resistant asthma expressed the highest levels of IL-17A. Further tests showed that while steroids were unable to lower the production of IL-17A in cells from patients with asthma, vitamin D significantly cut the production of IL-17A in cells from all patients studied. The results demonstrate that vitamin D could potentially provide an effective add-on treatment for all asthma sufferers, reducing the amount of steroid-based medicines prescribed. There is growing evidence that vitamin D deficiency may be responsible for triggering a range of diseases, including several cancers. The body makes most of its vitamin D from sunlight, although oily fish is a good dietary source. Professor Catherine Hawrylowicz from the Medical Research Council & Asthma UK Centre in Allergic Mechanisms of Asthma at King’s, who led the study, said the findings were ‘very exciting’. Light: The 'sunshine vitamin' could reduce the amount of steroids an asthma sufferer has to take . She said ‘They show that Vitamin D could one day be used not only to treat people with steroid resistant asthma but also to reduce the doses of steroids in other asthma patients, reducing the risk of harmful side effects. ‘The results are so positive that we are testing this in a clinical trial in steroid resistant asthma patients to further research the possibilities of vitamin D as a potential treatment.’ The study is published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Malayka Rahman, Research Analysis and Communications Officer at Asthma UK, said: ‘For the majority of people with asthma, current available medicines are an effective way of managing the condition but we know that they don’t work for everyone,  which is why research into new treatments is vital. ‘We also know that many people with asthma have concerns about the side effects of their medicines so if vitamin D is shown to reduce the amount of medicines required, this would have an enormous impact on people’s quality of life. We look forward to the results of the clinical trial.’ Ginger: Study shows that human airways become more relaxed when exposed to the root . Ginger could provide a new route for helping asthma patients, say US researchers. They found tissue samples taken from human airways became more relaxed when exposed to purified components of the spicy root also may have properties that help asthma patients breathe more easily. The ginger extracts enhanced the effect of medication known as beta-agonists which are commonly prescribed to people with asthma. Researcher Elizabeth Townsend, of Columbia University Department of Anesthesiology, said ‘In our study, we demonstrated that purified components of ginger can work synergistically with beta-agonists to relax airway smooth muscle . ‘These compounds may provide additional relief of asthma symptoms when used in combination.’ The results of the study will be presented at the American Thoracic Society 2013 International Conference in Philadelphia.","Vitamin D has the potential to significantly cut the symptoms of sufferers.

A new-look Bayern side featured teenagers Gianluca Gaudino and Pierre Hojbjerg alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger, making his first start of the season after a lengthy injury absence. With Xabi Alonso and Arjen Robben on the bench, Bayern, who had secured top spot in Group E with two games to spare, never hit top form.

Thomas Muller scored his 24th in the competition from the spot in the 18th minute to become Bayern's record Champions League goalscorer ahead of Mario Gomez. Sebastian Rode headed in his first Champions League goal following a fine move in the 84th before Mario Gotze added another in the 90th. The result leaves Bayern top with 15 points, a club record, and CSKA Moscow, who had keeper Igor Akinfeev to thank for keeping the score respectable, bottom on five. Manchester City snatched second spot with a 2-0 victory at Roma. 'I am proud of the team,' said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola, who made five changes to the side that beat Bayer Leverkusen four days ago and started with striker Robert Lewandowski and Rafinha on the bench. 'We were outstanding and in every game played better than each of our group opponents.' The Russians were up against it going into the match, needing a win to have any chance of qualifying, and Seydou Doumbia almost put them ahead after six minutes with a header that went narrowly wide. Bayern immediately stepped on the gas and Franck Ribery made their dominance count when he was brought down after a swift turn in the box, with Muller firing home from the spot. Doumbia should have levelled with a sensational solo run that saw him dribble past six Bayern players only for keeper Manuel Neuer to deny the Ivorian. Schweinsteiger, making his first start in a competitive game since the World Cup final in July, almost got a second for Bayern but Akinfeev, who has failed to keep a clean sheet in 27 consecutive Champions League games since 2006, tipped his shot over the bar.

ff3c3e6aeedab5803a74cb88623d4870b3c5d5f5,"The Department of Health and Human Services will spent an estimated $1.15 billion this year caring for minors in its Undocumented Alien Children (UAC) program, and Senate Democrats said Tuesday that they want to add an additional $1 billion for 2015. The program, part of the agency's Office of Refugee Resettlement, is responsible for the health and welfare of children who cross the U.S. border illegally and arrive without parents. An unprecedented flood of such children has arrived in recent weeks, with leaked photos showing overcrowded holding facilities run by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement division of the Department of Homeland Security. Underage illegal immigrants traveling without family members are held in those makeshift detention centers, three-quarters of which are on military bases, for a maximum of 72 hours while they are processed into the U.S. immigration system and given court dates. FLOOD: Children have raced across the U.S. border since President Obama's 2012 speech announcing that he had relaxed deportation standards for children who were already in the country . HHS says the number of 'unaccompanied alien children' it will serve in 2014 is more than double what it took in last year, but most sober estimates put the number far higher -- at least at 80,000 . After that, HHS takes over, with a dedicated budget for this year of $868 million, according to its most recent budget. A Senate Democratic aide told MailOnline on Tuesday that additional discretionary funds brought the planned total for 2014 to $911.9 million. But HHS's budget, prepared last year, anticipates caring for 60,000 children, not the 80,000 who more recent estimates expect to pour across the border – mostly from Central American countries. Adjusting for that difference, the agency will have to shift additional discretionary dollars into the UAC program, bringing the total to at least $1.2 billion. At least one estimate, appearing in the Washington Examiner, projects a total of 120,000 for fiscal year 2014. In 2011 HHS took custody of 6,775 such children. The number was 13,625 in 2012 and 24,668 in 2013. Despite widespread forecasts of another massive increase past the 60,000 expected for the current fiscal year, which ends on September 30, an HHS spokesperson told MailOnline on Tuesday afternoon that the agency's internal expectations haven't changed. 'We are still using 60K,' he wrote in an email. The spokesperson also referred questions about HHS's budget to the Office of Management and Budget inside the White House; that agency did not respond to emails seeking comment. Senate Democrats, led by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, announced Tuesday that they aim to put an additional $1 billion in play for 2015, bringing the program's planned total to $1.94 billion. That number would correspond to an expectation of more than 200,000 illegal alien children arriving next year. 'This is an emergency situation by any definition,' said Mikulski, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, on Tuesday. She also referred to the tens of thousands of children swarming into the United States as 'an urgent humanitarian crisis.' Not just adults: Border Patrol agents are apprehending hundreds of illegal immigrant children every day, and the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for taking care of them until a suitable adult family member can claim them . Unlike previous waves of illegal immigrants, hardly any of the children pouring across America's southern border are from Mexico; most of the flood is coming from Central America . Mikulski added that her committee foresees that the problem will get worse, providing 'expanded transfer authority to respond to sudden or urgent needs in the future ... to increase shelter capacity and provide critical support services for children in HHS care.' The appropriations committee will take up Mikulski's funding bill on Thursday. Feinstein lined up in favor of the added spending on Tuesday, saying in a statement that 'the recent influx of tens of thousands of children entering the country without their parents has resulted in emergency situations in border states.' 'Federal, state and local officials need increased resources to properly shelter, feed and clothe these children as they work to find solutions to these heartbreaking situations.' In 2013, HHS budgeted just $376 billion to deal with the problem. But that fiscal year began just months after President Barack Obama announced a major immigration law exemption for children who were brought into the U.S. illegally before June 2007. Children in Central America, and their parents, got a garbled message, believing that they could take advantage of a policy shift and enter the United States with impunity. Those who make it to the United States and are captured by border patrol officers get classroom education, mental health and medical services, recreation and other taxpayer-funded services. The Department of Justice is paying for their attorneys. Senate Appropriations Committee chair Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat, is putting an extra $1 billion into HHS's budget to care for illegal immigrant children in 2015 . Texas Sen. John Cornyn slammed President Obama on Tuesday for the influx of young illegals: 'These children are being preyed on by drug cartels and human traffickers, and they¿re at high risk of being kidnapped, raped, or even killed' “The average length of stay in the program is . currently near 35 days,' HHS says in published information sheets. 'Of the children served, some 85% are reunified . with their families.' It's unclear how many of those family members are in the United States legally. 'The majority of the youth are cared for through a network of state-licensed ORR-funded care providers.' In a Senate floor speech Tuesday, Texas Republican John Cornyn blamed the White House for creating the problem. 'Sadly, this crisis is directly the result of President Obama's own policies and it involves tens of thousands of young children,' he said. 'These children are being preyed on by . drug cartels and human traffickers, and they’re at high risk of being . kidnapped, raped, or even killed while traveling in this long dangerous . journey to the United States.' 'But sadly, when they arrive here, we still . have no way of guaranteeing their safety because of lack of an adequate . plan to deal with this humanitarian crisis.' Cornyn also slammed the White House for sending mixed signals to countless Third World families, saying that by changing immigration policy unilaterally, 'the president has created an extremely dangerous incentive for children and their parents to cross into the United States.'","The Department of Health and Human Services has a $912 million budget in FY2014 to care for 'Undocumented Alien Children' but underestimated how many minors would flood across the border .

ff3c78cc69c94190fdd622ebed7e5dd203ad6be0,"(CNN) -- A man who wrote a controversial book considered a ""how-to"" guide for pedophiles was booked into a Florida jail Tuesday after defending his book to reporters. Phillip Greaves, who was arrested Monday in Colorado, said ""The Pedophile's Guide to Love and Pleasure: A Child-Lover's Code of Conduct"" can be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles, and -- instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest -- teaches them to avoid illegal actions. Asked if he is a pedophile, Greaves said, ""I only have sex with grown-ups."" He said he has no children and ""I don't keep children around my house."" Polk County, Florida, Sheriff Grady Judd has said his detectives were able to establish jurisdiction in the case by conducting an undercover operation, buying the book through the mail. Greaves protested Tuesday he is the target of entrapment, but Judd disagreed. ""He wrote this book, he published this book, he put it on Amazon to sell,"" Judd told reporters as Greaves was booked into the Polk County Jail, ""and he freely responded to our desire to purchase it."" Greaves and his book gained national attention this year after Amazon.com defended selling the book despite angry comments and threats of boycotts. The book was removed from the website in November. Officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children, grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents. Judd said Greaves' book outlines a ""code of ethics"" that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children. Greaves told reporters Tuesday he wrote the book to exorcise his own childhood. He said he was introduced to sex at age 7 by a 10-year-old friend and began having sex with other children. It continued, he said, until he was about 15 when he stopped and did not have sex again for years. ""Once I got into adolescence, I suppose you could have identified me as an adolescent pedophile,"" he said. But now, he said, he is an example of the fact that people can reform. ""I think all speech should be protected,"" Greaves said. But ""I was not the one who solicited the material to be sent to Florida. I think Florida law is for Floridians and Colorado law is for Coloradoans."" He told reporters he will not be able to make bond: ""I'm actually quite poor."" CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on CNN's ""360°"" on Monday night that prosecutors may have a hard time convicting Greaves and maintained his arrest was unconstitutional. ""I don't think they can go forward because the book is clearly protected by the First Amendment,"" Toobin said. ""This book, as awful as it is, it is only words."" Judd vehemently disagreed with Toobin's assessment of the case. ""This has nothing to do with free speech and everything to do with obscenity,"" Judd said. ""We had a law in Florida that applied. We only needed jurisdiction."" He said the book violates Florida law. ""There's too much hand-wringing across the nation. When we can't stand together as a nation and say you can't write a book with real stories of children being sexually abused, then it's time to change the law."" Judd said of Greaves: ""Clearly, in our opinion, he's a pedophile. ... The guy is clearly trying to instruct people how to sexually abuse children, a step-by-step instruction guide with real-life examples. That's against the obscenity law in Florida, and we're excited to take it to court."" Referring to Toobin's comments about the book being just words, he said, ""Words become actions, and words in and of themselves can get you in trouble. If you threaten the president, you're in trouble. ... There are limits to what you can do."" He said prosecutors and a circuit judge signed off on the arrest. Toobin pointed to a similar case that went to the Supreme Court in 2002 in which cartoons depicting children in acts similar to ones in Greaves' book were deemed protected by the Constitution. ""Certainly the sheriff and I disagree about the constitutional issue, but I agree with him that the issue of child pornography is a very serious one, and I'm certainly glad that law enforcement is taking an active stand against it,"" Toobin said.","NEW: Phillip Greaves defends his book to reporters .

Michael ‘Connor’ Verkerke was playing with two of his brothers and another boy Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, who pulled out a knife and repeatedly stabbed Connor. The boy's great-uncle Jim Stearns told MLive that the horrific incident had left the family ‘absolutely numb’. He said Connor had told his brother: ‘If anything happens to me, it’s not your fault. I’ll always love you,’ as the boy had rushed his dying brother back to their parent’s house in Kentwood. Horrific: Michael 'Conner' Verkerke died Monday night after being stabbed in the back multiple times and he and friends played on a playground near his home . Police Jamarion didn't know Conner before the attack. They say the two boys had been playing together when Jamarion pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back . ‘Their . top priority right now is the mental health of their three remaining . children,’ Stearns said of the devastated Verkerke family. A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night at Pinebrook Village Mobile Home Park, the site of Monday’s deadly attack. About 100 people gathered to celebrate Connor's memory. Children . and adults both laughed and cried during the vigil, reports MLive before Stearns, who is the uncle of Connor's mom, . spoke to the crowd and everyone joined in to sing Jesus . Loves Me. Community . members honored Connor's memory with teddy bears, passed out by vigil . organizers, placed next to a cross on the side of the playground. A candlelight vigil was held on Wednesday night at Pinebrook Village Mobile Home Park, the site of Monday's deadly attack . Stearns . said the incident has 'terrorized' the park for kids - in particular, . two of Connor’s brothers who were with him when the attack occurred. 'They’re afraid,' he said. The Verkerke family were also concerned about the Jamarion Lawhorn's family. 'Even though . we’re dealing with a different type of pain, they’ll be dealing with a . similar pain every day for the rest of their lives. That’s not to be . taken lightly,' said Stearns. The community has some together to help Conner's mom pay for his funeral. A Go Fund Me page set up yesterday has already raised more than $13,000 from 321 people. The Grand Rapids Press . reports that Jamarion sobbed and trembled as he appeared in court on . Tuesday to face murder charges. Even the prosecutor, who has opted to . try him in juvenile court as an adult, remarked that he looked 'tiny' and younger than his age. His mother appeared in court with him and wiped away his tears and rubbed his back to comfort him. About 100 people gathered on Wednesday night to celebrate Connor's memory and sing Jesus Loves Me . Shocking: . Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, is charged with murder. He will be tried as an . adult in juvenile court. Even prosecutors said he looked small and young . for his age . Jamarion's lawyer entered a 'not guilty' plea and asked that the boy undergo a psychological examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial. The 12-year-old did, however, tell a judge that he understood the charges against him. Under Michigan law, Jamarion could be given a 'blended' sentence if he is convicted, which would keep him in a juvenile detention facility until he is 21. After that, a judge would determine whether he should be released or sent to adult prison. Police say that Jamarion's attack on Conner was unprovoked and inexplicable. He didn't know Conner before the attack and had joined the 9-year-old and two friends on the playground. Horrific: A 9-year-old boy died at the hospital after being attacked on the playground by a 12-year-old, police say. He was stabbed at least once in the back with a kitchen knife . Random: Police say the 12-year-old didn't know the young boy he attacked and he didn't live in the trailer park near the playground . Suddenly, . he pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in . the back, authorities say. Police aren't saying where Jamarion got the . weapon. Conner . ran to his home house nearby and collapsed on the porch. He was taken . to the hospital in critical condition an died hours later. Authorities . say Jamarion is the youngest child ever charged with murder in Kent . County - and one of the youngest in the state of Michigan. An . 11-year-old boy was convicted of killing his mother's boyfriend in 1997 . in Pontiac, Michigan. Witness Glen Stacy told the Press he was doing yard work when Jamarion approached him and asked to borrow his cell phone. Mr Stacy said he assumed the child was calling him mother. Instead the 12-year-old called cops and admitted to a brutal crime. Mr Stacy says the boy told police: 'I want to die. I don’t want to be on this earth anymore. Please pick me up.' Witness: Glen Stacy says the 12-year-old suspect asked to borrow his cell phone then called 911 and admitted he had killed . He says Jamarion told him that he lashed out because he had 'taken many pills' and nobody loved him. The 12-year-old was eerily calm and patiently waited for police, Mr Stacy told the Press. He only became animated when police finally arrived - and didn't immediately arrest him. Mr Stacy said the first emergency personnel went to the playground to help the victim. This upset the boy. 'Hello. I’m right here. You’re going the wrong way,' Jamarion shouted as officers arrived. When police did finally come for him, he walked toward the cops with his hands out in front of him - showing he wanted to be handcuffed.","Michael 'Connor' Verkerke was fatally stabbed while playing in a Michigan playground on Monday .

""Rolex is convinced that Tiger Woods still has a long career ahead of him and that he has all the qualities required to continue to mark the history of golf,"" read a statement on Wednesday from the Swiss company, which also sponsors CNN's Living Golf Show. ""This association pays tribute to the exceptional nature of Tiger Woods and the leading role he plays in forging the sport's global appeal."" Rolex has a history of linking with golfing greats, including 18-time major champion Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. It is the second backing for Woods' commercial value in two days, with influential business magazine Forbes keeping the 14-time major winner at the top of its ""most valuable athlete"" standings with a brand worth of $55 million. It cited his June deal with Japanese medical group Kowa as evidence that he was far from a spent force. Woods dropped out of the world's top 50 this week ahead of the PGA Tour's fall season Frys.com Open -- a minor tournament that he has never played before. He has not stepped out for an official event since the PGA Championship in August, but will make his ninth start of an injury-plagued season as he warms up for the Presidents Cup in Australia next month -- having been given a wild-card place by U.S. team captain Fred Couples. ""I'm excited to be back. I've had good practice sessions at home and am eager to get back under the gun,"" Woods said ahead of the California tournament. Woods' website said he shot a course-record 10-under-par 62 last Saturday at his new home course in Jupiter, Florida -- the Greg Norman-designed Medalist Club. He will play the opening rounds at CordeValle Golf Club, near San Jose, with 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen of South Africa and U.S. amateur Patrick Cantlay on Thursday and Friday.","Tiger Woods signs new endorsement deal with Swiss watch-maker Rolex .

ff3d7d0880e2ddfa51f7029c8178959160e7003f,"(CNN) -- You knew Tony Soprano from the small things. The way he chewed his cigar in the opening credits of ""The Sopranos."" The way he shuffled to get his newspaper, sloppily clad in a white bathrobe. The way his voice changed, from a schmooze to a bark, when he talked to his psychiatrist. The way he killed. James Gandolfini was a master of the small things. ""I remember telling him many times: 'You don't get it. You're like Mozart,' "" David Chase, who created ""The Sopranos,"" said in a statement. Gandolfini died Wednesday night while on vacation in Italy. He was 51. The cause of death was not announced but was believed to be a heart attack. Before ""The Sopranos,"" Gandolfini -- a one-time truck driver and bartender who didn't turn to acting until he was in his mid-20s -- was a well-regarded character actor on stage and screen. He had a small role in the 1992 Broadway revival of ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" with Alec Baldwin and Jessica Lange, and appeared in such films as the Quentin Tarantino-written ""True Romance"" (1993), ""Get Shorty"" (1995) and ""A Civil Action"" (1998). Though his roles were limited, he invested them with beauty and invention. But he appeared destined for a career as the supporting actor until ""The Sopranos"" came along. ""The Sopranos"" was TV on a knife's edge. The HBO show, which put the cable network on the map for original material, could have been farce, could have been tragedy, could have been slasher film or kitchen-sink drama or gangster-movie parody. And, in fact, it was all these things, held together on screen by Gandolfini as woebegone Mafia chief (or was that ""waste management professional""?) Tony Soprano. Tony Soprano was an unusual protagonist, especially for a television show: a violent, brutal mob boss, a beleaguered patriarch, a calculating businessman. It was as if ""The Godfather's"" Sonny, Vito and Michael Corleone had been combined into one hulking bear of a figure. It could have been otherwise. Opinion: Gandolfini's gift to television -- and America . Gandolfini was one of three finalists for the role, Alan Sepinwall observed in his terrific TV history, ""The Revolution Was Televised."" He was chosen because, Chase said, ""the show I envisioned is the show that's got Jimmy in it. It's a much darker show with Jimmy in it."" ""At one time, I had said that this thing could be like a live-action 'Simpsons,' "" Chase told Sepinwall. ""Once I saw him do it, I thought, 'No, that's not right. It can be absurdist, it can have a lot of stupid s*** in it, but it should not be a live-action 'Simpsons.' "" In fact, what it became was the best-written show in TV history, according to a recent survey by the Writers Guild of America. Many episodes were as rich as novels, or as finely wrought as a good short story. Writing, however, will only take you so far; you need actors to inhabit those characters. And with Gandolfini, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco and so many more, ""The Sopranos"" gave life to the scripts. Fans can pick their favorites, but two episodes stand out for Gandolfini's performances. One, ""Whitecaps,"" includes a scene between him and Falco (as Tony's wife, Carmela) that was as raw and painful as watching an argument between your parents. (If the pair had ever starred in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", ticket-sellers could have made a fortune.) The other, ""Join the Club,"" features an out-of-body experience in which Tony -- in a coma -- imagines he's an optics salesman named Kevin Finnerty. Here, Gandolfini drops Tony's New Jersey accent and with it, his tough-guy veneer. He's suddenly reasonable, open, somehow brighter. Special effects foreman: ""So long, paisan"" It's easy to confuse actors with their most famous roles; with this one episode, Gandolfini showed that he was no more Tony Soprano than he was Kevin Finnerty, but that he was playing them. Brilliantly. ""If anything, Gandolfini often took things further than Chase had planned,"" Sepinwall wrote. In the pilot, a scene ""called for Tony to slap Christopher (Imperioli) lightly across the face; instead, Gandolfini picked up the smaller Imperioli to make his displeasure clear."" (He worked to get himself into Tony's frame of mind, Gandolfini told ""Inside the Actors Studio,"" as noted in The New York Times' obituary. He'd stay up all night, put a rock in his shoe. ""It's silly, but it works,"" he said.) ""The Sopranos"" gave Gandolfini fame and wealth; he got in a contract dispute before the fifth season, eventually winning a contract worth around $13 million, according to a Variety report at the time. But instead of pursuing Hollywood leading roles, he immersed himself in his craft and his interests. He played a general in ""In the Loop"" and the CIA director in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" neither role showy or outsized. He starred in the Broadway production of ""God of Carnage"" and was nominated for a Tony. He produced documentaries about wounded soldiers. Galdolfini left his mark on New Jersey . Among his last roles was in Chase's little-seen ""Not Fade Away,"" which came out last year. In it, Gandolfini plays another New Jersey sad sack, this one a 1960s grocer failing to connect with his rock 'n' roll-besotted son. He could have played the part as a ""Great Santini""-like martinet, or a befuddled softie, or an ignorant suburban climber. Instead, he manages to fill it with grace notes, amused one minute, frustrated the next, finally a loving father quietly handing his son some money as the boy prepares to drive away. He was a complicated, three-dimensional figure, and he gave the movie unexpected depth. Gandolfini will almost certainly be best remembered for Tony Soprano, his role of a lifetime. It's a shame that lifetime was so brief. The master of the small things left a legacy that looms large.

ff3dfe37cd854ed2fd811b2bc66e14c98e14c98f,"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- As Zimbabwe battles a cholera epidemic that has already killed hundreds, one company thinks it may have found a potential solution to the world water crisis. A shortage of clean drinking water has unleashed a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe. Element Four, a small Canadian firm, has applied its water technology to create the WaterMill, a novel electricity-powered machine that draws moisture from the air and purifies it into clean drinkable water. The compact WaterMill, which goes on sale in the spring, is designed for household use. More crucially for countries such as Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Element Four is also working on another device, the WaterWall, which could potentially supply an entire village in the developing world. The team at Element Four shares an ambitious goal: to quench the world's growing thirst for water. Now the 10-person company is taking on a challenge that global multinationals have struggled to meet. Rick Howard, the CEO of the company, says it was at a U.N. conference on water in New York last summer that he realized just how revolutionary Element Four's technology might be. ""There we were on the same stage as GE, Dow Chemical and Siemens, and it was a complete shock to us when we heard the solutions they were offering. We realized we had something that could effect change,"" Howard tells CNN. The WaterMill draws in air through a filter and then cools it into water droplets. This water then passes through a special filter and is exposed to ultraviolet light, which rids it of bacteria. The product Element Four is designing for the developing world is called the WaterWall and is constructed by taking several of the water-making cells of the consumer appliance and hooking them up in series on a wall. The U.N., which has declared 2005-2015 the International Decade for Water, expects 1.8 billion people to live in regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025. It's no wonder then that Element Four is being closely watched by the tech world. The WaterMill is being displayed at the Wired Store in New York, a temporary store the magazine opens every holiday season that showcases the future of technology. About one in five people in the world lack access to safe drinking water, and shortages pose serious health problems for much of the developing world. Lack of clean water, coupled with poor sanitation practices, can lead to outbreaks of water-borne diseases, such as cholera and dysentery, which in turn, can cause life-threatening forms of diarrhea. More than 500 people have died in Zimbabwe. Diarrheal disease is the third leading cause of death from infectious diseases, and the majority of those deaths are among children under the age of 5, according to the WHO and UNICEF. Most of those deaths could be prevented if improvements to sanitation and drinking water were made. But can an invention like the WaterWall really help ease the world's water shortage and help prevent health disasters like the outbreak in Zimbabwe from occurring in the future? ""There are some brilliant inventions out there, but they are expensive and difficult to get hold of,"" says Paul Jawor, an emergency water and sanitation consultant with international aid organization Doctors Without Borders. The WaterMill retails for about $1,300, but Howard estimates that a pared down version -- without the bells and whistle -- for use in places like Africa would cost about $300. The biggest challenge of a product like the WaterWall, Howard says, is the power consumed by the water-making cells. To counter that, the product is designed to turn on in stages so it doesn't overload fragile power grids. In comparison to solutions like desalination, which can cost billions of dollars to develop, that's cheap. ""For about $300 we can start saving lives. Ours is a very scalable product,"" Howard says. But there are skeptics. Frank Lawson, an engineering adviser at international charity WaterAid, said the solution Element Four is devising wouldn't be appropriate for the charity's projects. For one, the technology doesn't work in very dry climates. The machine only functions at or above about 35 percent relative humidity levels. Furthermore, it requires an energy source. ""Our technologies have to be within the capacity of the benefiting community -- both technically and financially,"" Lawson says. WaterAid uses a number of low-cost and sustainable solutions, such as rainwater harvesting and hand-dug wells, to help communities in more than 17 countries access water. But those solutions depend upon the availability of water in the area, and fresh water supplies worldwide are feeling the squeeze from population growth, pollution and climate change. Howard admits the company needs to focus on growing its business first, so it may be some time before the Element Four's products make their way to the developing world. ""We quickly came to realize that if we didn't first build a business to perfect the product and application, then we weren't going to be able to get to a point where we could have a significant humanitarian impact,"" he says. But Howard and partner Jonathan Ritchey are in various stages of discussions with several humanitarian groups in the field. Howard declined to name the organizations. It's early, but the company's core principle is ""to do good as we do well,"" he says. ""That's part of truly what drives us -- knowing that at some point we will be able to do some significant good.""","Element Four has developed a machine that creates clean water out of air .

ff3e280199bedfffcde1b5fb2342c691094568e0,"It started with a chance conversation between a doctor and a nurse several years ago. But that brief encounter may end up exposing what could be one of the largest Medicare frauds in U.S. history. Dr. Alon Vainer, a medical director at dialysis clinics in Georgia, was discussing clinic procedures with one of the nurses, Daniel Barbir. The two men say they saw something they believed was very wrong: expensive medicine, and lots of it, was being tossed in the trash. And the clinic workers were being told to do it, the two men say. ""When we sat down and started talking about it and getting into details, we actually realized exactly what was going on,"" Vainer said. The alleged waste was being carried out on a massive scale and, the nurse and the doctor said, they knew why almost immediately. They claim it was a way for their company, DaVita Inc., to defraud the government, overbill Medicare and Medicaid and make a fortune. ""We're talking in the hundreds of millions, easily,"" Vainer said. ""The profit this company raked from those two schemes, only from those two drugs, was hundreds of millions of dollars."" The allegations of massive fraud have implications for all Americans. The alleged fraud would have involved Medicare and Medicaid patients, whose medicine is paid for by U.S. taxpayers. Vainer and Barbir said the alleged fraud schemes they discovered were going on at the company's clinics all across the country -- at the time, about 2003 through 2010, more than 1,800 -- with tens of thousands of patients. It was enormous, they claim, and Vanier said it was all a deliberate strategy coordinated by the company. ""It was just a scheme in order to fraudulently increase and maximize and boost the Medicare revenue, Medicare payment, so therefore fraudulently increase their revenue,"" he said. DaVita Inc., based in downtown Denver, is one of the nation's largest dialysis companies. The name means ""Giving Life"" in Italian. The company just moved into a brand new $101 million office tower, complete with fountains, gardens and even a suspended ski gondola inside for private meetings. DaVita has grown in the past couple of years and now runs roughly 2,000 dialysis clinics across the country, which has added up to a $7 billion business. The dialysis empire is run by CEO Kent Thiry, who dresses like one of the Three Musketeers, has adopted a company slogan of 'One for all and all for one' and in company staff meetings leads his employees, who he calls villagers, in cheers of ""DaVita!"" Thiry is reportedly paid an estimated $15 million a year, according to the Wall Street Journal, which has called him the best compensated CEO in Colorado. Most of DaVita's revenue comes from a single source: taxpayers. More than two-thirds of DaVita's revenue comes from Medicare and Medicaid payments. If Vainer and Barbir's allegations are true, the company threw away hundreds of millions of dollars of medicine, and taxpayers paid for it. And, if true, the alleged fraud schemes could represent one of the largest Medicare frauds in U.S. history. Vanier explained to CNN how DaVita instructed its nurses to administer a 100-milligram dose of the iron drug Venofor. ""For example, if a patient requires this dose once per week, you'd administer 100 milligrams, waste nothing and charge Medicare for 100 milligrams,"" he said. ""But what DaVita did, instead of charge (for) one vial, they give 50 milligrams of this vial (and) put the residual into the trash."" he said. With another vial, he said, the company would give 25 milligrams to a patient and put the rest in the trash, then repeat it with yet another vial, when one vial could have been given without waste. The more vials DaVita used, the more the company was able to bill the government, the men say. Vainer and Barbir claim they tried to call attention to the massive waste and tried to get it stopped.  But instead, they say, they were basically told to stop causing trouble and to continue following the company's protocols. ""That's what upset me the most,"" Barbir said. ""and that's when I went to Dr. Vainer. I said, 'Dr. Vainer, I can't do that.'"" Barbir says he quit his job and left the clinic rather than continue where fraud was going on. Vainer claims the company punished him for speaking up. ""Of course, once they found out, they did not renew my medical directorship or my practice,"" Vainer claimed. ""We are a three-physician practice, and it was a significant loss of revenue."" Today, both men have filed a whistleblower lawsuit under the U.S. False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. government, charging DaVita with massive Medicare fraud. They stand to make millions if DaVita is found guilty. DaVita's CEO wouldn't talk, but the company's attorney Kim Rivera did. When asked about the plaintiffs' allegation that DaVita had come up with so-called schemes to throw away drugs and maximize profits, Rivera said: ""Well that's just wrong. If you look at the facts of the case, first of all, the doctors make the dosing decisions.... When you look at what the practices were -- decisions being made by doctors, based on what was in the best interest of their patients. And they took into account a variety of things. ""You can't just look at one issue. You have to look at things like infection control, what the patient's going to do, how the patient's going to do with particular doses. And so, during that entire time what we did, what the doctors did, was appropriate."" But other companies, including DaVita's main competitor, used smaller vials and smaller combinations at times, limiting what was thrown away. DaVita reiterated its decisions to throw away medicine were for ""sound clinical reasons"" and ""never to increase wastage."" Plaintiffs' attorneys Lin Wood and Marlan Wilbanks, who claim DaVita made as much as $800 million over-billing the government, say that DaVita's defense won't hold up in court. ""It's not just the taxpayers that are the victims here, it's the health care system,"" Wood said. ""It doesn't take a graduate degree to understand what's going on here,"" Wilbanks said. ""This is just dishonesty."" DaVita denies that and vows to fight the case in court. But earlier this year, while denying it did anything wrong, DaVita settled a similar case in Texas for $55 million. Pat Burns, with the watchdog group ""Taxpayers Against Fraud,"" says the bigger problem is that even if a company gets caught cheating the government, the company executives never seem to face any punishment. Fines are paid and business continues as usual. ""The way it's set up right now, if the fraud is not caught, then taxpayers foot the bill, Burns said. ""If the fraud is caught, stockholders foot the bill."" Burns and others have been arguing for much harsher treatment when companies are found guilty of defrauding the federal government. He points to record billion-dollar fines, particularly in the pharmaceutical business, that are paid, but executives don't get punished and the companies continue to do business with the government. In fact, one of DaVita's defenses to CNN is that the federal government itself declined to charge the company with wrongdoing, even after reviewing the fraud allegations. ""The government has come in and thoroughly investigated what the allegations are, and in both cases the government decided to drop it and move on,"" Rivera said. Federal prosecutors in Georgia declined to intervene in the case but stated in a letter that decision ""should not be construed as a statement about the merits of the case."" The short-staffed U.S. Department of Justice declines to join lawsuits all the time, instead allowing private citizens who hire private lawyers to essentially prosecute for the government, Burns said. ""The U.S. Department of Justice simply doesn't have the people,"" Burns said. ""It should have the people. I think we all would agree to that. It simply doesn't."" Which brings us back to the original meeting of one doctor and one nurse who now stand to make millions if these allegations of fraud are proven true. The biggest winners, though, in their lawsuit could be taxpayers. The U.S. government will recover the bulk of whatever they win. They and others like them are essentially the U.S. taxpayers' deputies in the fight against health care fraud. Asked if they are surprised that they have to defend the U.S. taxpayer, Barbir said simply, ""I'm not surprised. It's not easy to come forward and stand up and tell the truth, but it's the right thing to do."" The case is set for trial later next year.","A doctor and nurse have filed a whistleblower suit against DaVita Dialysis .

ff3e40330995f567fa94da6d2510a603f5da2f21,"It is the news we have all been waiting for. That renowned flag-bearer for the aviation industry, Ryanair, is planning to branch out into the world of package holidays. This famed Irish purveyor of ‘low-cost’ travel has revealed that the grand concept of ‘Ryanair Holidays’ may be only a half-decade away. ‘If it becomes Ryanair Holidays at a point in time, it is a logical way for the brand to go,’ the airline’s chief marketing officer Kenny Jacobs said earlier this week. ‘I can see us launching this in the next five years.’ We're all going on a Ryanair Holiday, no more worries for a week or two: Although not for the next five years . On the off-chance that you can’t wait that long for the tantalising prospect of a Ryanair-assisted escape to a sunny destination (or an east European city you haven’t heard of), here is a preview of what we may (as in won’t at all, really. Because this is satire) all be able to look forward to. It will be the best thing ever. Seriously, 2019 cannot come soon enough. (1) Hotel rooms from just £6.99 a night* . Just look at those eye-catching prices. Amazing, incredible, excellent value for money. And definitely a fair reflection of the true cost of the room. You just need to click through these next seven pages of terms and conditions. Oh, and there may be a couple of little extra fees that bring the price up to £79.99 a night. Oh, and if you could just add in your contact details here, and tick those boxes there, and that’s it – a bargain £111.99 a night. (2) Exciting ways to pay . Did we say £111.99 a night? Sorry, that price only applies if you are paying with the Angolan kwanza or the Mozambique metical (sorry, cash please, notes only). Or if you are using the Super-Duper Ryanair Hotel Cashcard, which is available from literally some outlets in some places. If you want to use a credit or debit card, we’re afraid that there will be a tiny additional charge of £27.99 per booking. Thank you for your understanding. A nice man who will definitely sell you a great holiday. And definitely won't refer to you as an 'idiot'. Oh no . (3) Early-bird check-in times . To enjoy our hotel rooms from £6.99* a night, you will need to check in at the hotel at 4:20am, ahead of being allowed into your room at 6:20am. This is due to the hotels being inflexible in their rules, and charging extortionate fees that are completely beyond our control. Check-in at 2pm is available for a discreet extra fee of £49.99 each . (4) Another teensy-weensy additional cost for checking in . And it really will be teensy-weensy. Just £25.99 (per person, rather than per room. Sorry about that). This is due to the endlessly high cost of running a front desk at a hotel (those little pens with the hotel name written on them do not – we’re afraid – pay for themselves). You can, of course, avoid this almost unnoticeable charge by downloading your own room key onto a piece of paper and bringing it with you. Do not lose your paper key. There will a charge for losing your paper key – and a personal telling-off from the chief executive. Which way to Las Ramblas, mate? Some hotels may be closer to the centre of Barcelona than others . (5) A miniscule extra fee for luggage . Bags are heavy. Carrying a full suitcase along a hotel corridor causes a lot of wear and tear to the fabric of the carpets – especially if you are staying at one of those posh hotels where a nice man in a smart uniform wheels your bag to your room on a trolley, just six hours after you have arrived. With this in mind, there will be an extra fee of just £29.99 per bag (on check-in, and on check-out) to ensure that the hotel carpets do not have holes in them. You can avoid this charge by travelling stress-free, carrying just a convenient purse filled with air. (6) Hotels in not-at-all-misleading places . There will be lots of splendid hotels in lots of brilliant locations – some as close to the city centre as 70 miles away. Book ahead now for first-rate properties in Barcelona (Reus or Girona), Munich (Memmingen) and Venice (Treviso). Other possibilities may include Amsterdam (Beijing), Madrid (Leicester), Prague (Southampton) and Bratislava (Mars). (7) Endless chances to win, win, win . The phone in your room may ring at 3am. ‘Hello. Can I interest you in a scratchcard?’ Would you like a scratchcard? Buy a scratchcard and you can win another scratchcard’. We're all on our way to Munich. Or, at least, an airport that is close to Munich. Depending on you define 'close' (8) Lovely, comfortable, luxury beds . Due to cost constraints and an unfailing commitment to competitive pricing, all beds will be an extremely generous three inches wide by four inches long. The bed of the next hotel guest may be directly in front of your bed. This will not affect the quality of your holiday. (9) Entertaining music on check-out . Once your holiday is over, just as you are leaving the hotel, you will be treated to an in-no-way-annoying tootling of trumpets and the announcement that: ‘You have enjoyed another on-time Ryanair holiday. Last year, 98 per cent of all Ryanair holidays were on time. They were all great, and nobody had any complaints, concerns, gripes or quibbles.’ (10) Hugely helpful and friendly staff . Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary once described passengers who fail or forget to print out their own boarding passes as ‘idiots’ who should ‘b***** off’. All hotel staff on Ryanair Holidays will work to similar levels of courtesy, politeness and professionalism. Of course, now that Ryanair has rebranded as a cuddly-wuddly airline, and Mr O’Leary has said that 'being nice to our customers is a new and winning strategy’, all holidays will be gold-plated, wondrous experiences. Oh why must we wait five years, Michael? Why?","Ryanair has revealed plans to start selling package holidays as well as flights .
The service is expected to launch at some point during the next five years .

ff3e40c1ef7d26108366df080c15e06a0fedcbb9,"Former escort Madison Ashton has lost her appeal against the estate of billionaire Richard Pratt, who she says promised her millions. Ms Ashton launched an appeal against the 2012 decision to reject her bid for part of the cardboard king's estate. Ms Ashton said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two children and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress. Scroll down for video . Madison Ashton (pictured here at court in 2012) has lost her appeal against the estate of the late cardboard billionaires, Richard Pratt . Although the Supreme Court agreed the pair had the conversation, it found Ms Ashton's acceptance of $100,000 and the transfer of car into her name was done in full satisfaction of the trust claim. In November 2005, Ms Ashton signed a document from a employee of Mr Pratt's company, Visy Industries, that released Mr Pratt from any financial responsibility in exchange for a payment of $50,000 to the former mistress. Mr Pratt died in 2009. In appealing the decision, Ms Ashton sought a declaration that Mr Pratt's 2003 promises constituted a legally binding contract and anything she signed in November 2005 was void. She also sought damages from Mr Pratt's widdoe, Jeanne Pratt. Billionaire Mr Pratt died in 2009 . Ms Ashton appeared before the Supreme Court of NSW today . But on Monday, the Court of Appeal dismissed her bid, saying the arrangement failed to spell out important terms such as Ms Ashton's obligations as mistress, how long it would last and the details of how the trusts would work. The court said Ms Ashton had received substantial gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress and there was nothing to suggest she was prevented from returning to the escort industry. Madison Ashton, who was once showered with gifts as Mr Pratt's mistress, claims the two of them were in a de-facto relationship, and it was not just a 'business' arrangement the pair had. Madison Ashton who was known as one of Australia’s most notorious prostitutes - aka Christine McQueen — stopped working as a hooker in 2003 after Pratt (right) promised her he would look after her and her two children. Ms Ashton, who also sued the cardboard baron's estate for $10 million in 2012 lost and racked up a million dollar legal bill. In September, The Daily Telegraph reported, the court heard Pratt had a 'voracious appetite for young woman like Ms Ashton and that promising her five million dollars wouldn't have been very much money to such a wealthy man. Ms Ashton, mwho was known as one of Australia’s most notorious prostitutes - aka Christine McQueen — stopped working as an escort in 2003 after Mr Pratt promised he would look after her and her two children. It was reported she claimed to have given up a lucrative career in the high class escort business to become Mr Pratt's mistress . A book called 'Mistress: The True Stories of Mistresses and Their Men' released last year delved into the couples bizarre relationship. Ms Ashton said Mr Pratt had promised to set up two trust funds, worth $2.5 million each, for her two children and pay her $500,000 as a 'retainer' to stop working as an escort and become his mistress . The late Richard Pratt (pictured) who was elected as Carlton's Football club's president Richard Pratt in 2007 was claimed to be in a de-facto relationship with prostitute Madison Ashton. Writer Matthew Benns and co-author Terry Smyth say Mr Pratt was one Australia's business giants, but  it wasn't just wealth that pleased him. Rather, he had an 'apparently endless desire' for sex, Benns and Smyth wrote, sustaining two long-running affairs with a pair of young women from the bush. They were Shari-Lea Hitchcock, from Cambewarra, on the New South Wales south coast; and Peggy Jane Heslop - better known as Madison Ashton, sex worker and Penthouse Pet - who stemmed from Wangaratta, in Victoria's north-east.

Pope John Paul II spent decades constantly questioning whether he was worthy of the role, according to private diaries published yesterday. John Paul, who led the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 until his death in 2005, will be made a saint in April and remains for many Catholics a towering model of faith and commitment. The diaries, which he requested were destroyed, give a glimpse into his private spiritual life, showing a man who never became complacent despite the grandeur of the papacy and his star status among many Catholics.6 . Instead he agonised about whether he was doing enough. His handwritten notes, published as 'John Paul II: I am very much in God's hands. Personal notes 1962-2003', are a series of his reflections rather than a daily diary. Although he played a very active public role in communist-era Poland and as pope, the man born Karol Wojtyla in southern Poland in 1920 rarely referred to public events in these pages. In one note in 1981, the then Cardinal Wojtyla reflected on a theological discussion with other clerics and asked: 'The word of the Lord. Do I love the word of God? Do I live by it? Do I serve it willingly. Help me, Lord, to live by your word,"" he asked. ""Do I serve the Holy Spirit that lives in the Church?' In the same passage, he wrote, alternating between Latin and his native Polish: 'A pure, holy and immaculate sacrifice. This is why He demands from his priests that they should be of undivided heart (celibate) and demands priestly purity. Jesus, help me!' Before his death, John Paul entrusted his diaries to Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, his personal secretary and now a cardinal in the southern city of Krakow, with instructions that they be burned. In the foreword to the book, Dziwisz said he did not burn them because they hold the key to understanding the pope's private spiritual life. Pope John Paul II pictured with his secretary Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz . 'They reveal the other side of the person whom we knew as .. the pastor of the universal Church,' wrote the cardinal, who was both praised and criticised in Polish Catholic circles after announcing the publication of the book last month. Now available only in Polish, the 638-page book is dominated by deep theological reflections that reveal little of what the pope was otherwise thinking or doing when he wrote them. Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz said he did not burn them because they hold the key to understanding the pope's private spiritual life . The picture that emerges deepens but does not jar with his public image, in contrast to the posthumous diaries of Mother Teresa - who died in 1997 and was beatified by John Paul in 2003 - that revealed her long periods of doubt about God's existence. Despite the questioning of his own role, there is no sign in the diaries from 1962 to 2003 that the pope's belief in God wavered. The first signs of his questioning appear in comments from 1970 where he wrote: ""Can the misfortunes of people close to me, which have happened recently, be seen as a punishment? As a sign? What can it mean?"" He paid close attention to the skills required of a priest. ""What language do I use when I speak to people?"" he asked in 1974. ""Do I proclaim the Gospel with complete conviction?"" In his final years, debilitated by illness, the pope's entries become sparser and the handwriting less assured. The last entry in 2003 referred to the Biblical story of Jonah, who was ordered by God to preach his word but instead runs away. The pope, who before his final illness travelled tirelessly around the globe preaching the Gospel, wrote in a sloping script in Italian across the bottom of the page: 'Jonah, this is the fear of proclaiming the love of God.' Pope Francis looks at a Harley Davidson motorcycle in June 2013 . Pope Francis helped raised more than £200,000 for charity yesterday by selling his signed Harley Davidson. The head of the Catholic Church doesn't get much time to cruise around the streets of Rome on the Dyna Super Glide bike. So he decided to auction it off and donate the funds to Caritas Roma, a charity which supports those in need around the world. The 1,585cc Harley Davidson went under the hammer yesterday (Thurs) at Bonhams' Grand Palais auction with an estimate of just £10,000. But the prospect of owning a bike belonging to the Pope became too much for many, sending bidding through the roof. Potential buyers in the room, on the phone and online battled it out for the bike, with offers soon crossing the 100,000 euro (£83,000) mark. Bids continued to come with an online customer winning the auction, paying a staggering 210,000 euros (£175,000). Premiums took the final price to £200,976. Next up came the Pope's biker jacket, which sold for a staggering £47,851 - bringing his charity sales to almost £250,000. The staggering sale had similarities to when a US casino owner paid £127,000 for Pope Benedict XVI's Volkswagen Golf in 2005.","John Paul led the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 until his death in 2005 .

ff3f9ab11de5d0a20e88ce87a629a6cb19c8bade,"Chicago (CNN) -- Jurors deliberated a full day without reaching a verdict Thursday in the trial of a man accused of killing the mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew of entertainer Jennifer Hudson. William Balfour, Hudson's former brother-in-law, faces charges of first-degree murder, home invasion, residential burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer has argued that there is no forensic evidence linking him to the killings. Heated closing arguments Wednesday set a tense tone in the courtroom before the judge sent the 12 jurors into deliberations. The singer-actress kept her head down during much of Cook County Prosecutor Jennifer Bagby's closing argument. After showing autopsy photos of the victims, Bagby pointed toward Balfour. ""It's time to hold him responsible,"" she said. ""They have failed to prove their case,"" Balfour's attorney Amy Thompson said Wednesday during her closing argument, her voice rising. ""He is on trial for his life."" Thompson argued that police homed in on Balfour rather than conducting a full investigation. ""In their mind, this wasn't a whodunnit,"" she said. No DNA evidence points to Balfour, said Thompson, who also questioned police work in the case, describing a set of keys that she said surfaced on an evidence list a month after the slayings. ""Those keys show how desperate the state was. They resorted to this. ... My client is an innocent man,"" she said. But prosecutors argued that physical and circumstantial evidence links Balfour to the killings and described as ""absurd"" defense claims that police may have planted evidence or been part of a conspiracy to frame Balfour. Prosecutor Jim McKay told jurors that there was a ""tsunami of circumstantial evidence."" ""The circumstantial facts of this case are drowning this guy in guilt,"" he said. Bagby said in her closing argument that Balfour had threatened to kill the family of Julia Hudson, Jennifer Hudson's sister. ""If you leave me, I'll kill you. I'll kill your family first. You'll be the last to die,"" he had said, according to Bagby. ""He went in that house for one reason, and one reason only, to carry out that threat,"" Bagby told jurors. Balfour is accused of fatally shooting Hudson's mother, Darnell Donerson, 57, and the singer's brother, Jason Hudson, 29, in their Chicago home in October 2008. The body of Hudson's 7-year-old nephew, Julian King, was found three days later in an abandoned vehicle. Prosecutors have portrayed Balfour as a jealous man who murdered the three people in a rage at the thought that his wife had a boyfriend. In her closing argument, Bagby said Balfour shot Hudson's mother as she tried to defend herself with a broom. ""He fired that gun at her over and over and over,"" Bagby said. McKay called Balfour ""a true coward."" ""He shoots a 57-year-old grandmother in the back. He shoots a 29-year-old man in his sleep. He shoots a 7-year-old twice in the head,"" McKay told jurors. ""The family, the community, the city, the country demand justice."" There have been 83 witnesses and 11 days of testimony in the trial. Hudson, who was on hand through the trial, was called as the prosecution's first witness. She broke down in tears several times on the stand as she recalled her family. ""None of us wanted her to marry him,"" Hudson said of her sister's decision to marry Balfour. ""We did not like how he treated her. ""Where he was, I tried not to be,"" she said. The deaths took place a year after Hudson, who rose to fame as a contestant on ""American Idol,"" won an Oscar for her role in the movie ""Dreamgirls."" In a recent interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Hudson reflected on the life of her mother. ""My mother was a very wise and strong person. I feel like she raised us well, and she prepared me well, and so that's what I live by,"" she said. Her career has continued to blossom and remains varied since her relatives' deaths. Recent milestones include penning a memoir detailing her struggles with her weight; being cast as Nelson Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie, in an upcoming movie; releasing a new album; and singing a well-received tribute to Whitney Houston at the Grammy Awards in February.

ff3ff3a9c1b157ba41f10092cc2a565533eca092,"Studies have shown that people from Denmark are officially the happiest people on Earth, and now scientists think they know why. According to research from the University of Warwick, genetics could be the key to explaining a nation’s levels of happiness. Researchers who looked at survey data from 131 countries found that the closer a nation was genetically to the Danes, the happier its people were. University of Warwick researchers have investigated why Danes are so happy (stock image shown). The country regularly tops polls of the world's happiest people. They found there was a correlation between Danish genes and happiness, while people with Danish ancestry were also happier . Economists at the University's Centre for Competitive Advantage in the Global Economy (Cage) looked at why certain countries top the world happiness rankings. Last year's World Happiness Report from the United Nations ranked Denmark the happiest nation on Earth, with an average life satisfaction score of 7.69 out of 10. It was followed by four other northern European countries, Norway, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden. The UK was ranked 22nd on the list of 156 countries, with a score of 6.88. The world's most miserable country was said to be Togo, west Africa, which managed only 2.93 on the satisfaction scale. Other African countries also dominated the bottom of the ratings.Denmark has also topped the European Commission's ""Eurobarometer"" table of citizen well-being and happiness every year since 1973. The research, published by the German economic research institute IZA in its Discussion Paper series, could help to solve the puzzle of why a country like Denmark so regularly tops the world happiness rankings. Danish birth was also associated with specific versions of a gene that influences brain levels of the mood chemical serotonin. Compared with people from other countries, Danes were less likely to possess a short version of the gene linked to low levels of life satisfaction. ‘The results were surprising,’ said Economist Dr Eugenio Proto from Cage. ‘We found that the greater a nation's genetic distance from Denmark, the lower the reported wellbeing of that nation. ‘Our research adjusts for many other influences including Gross Domestic Product, culture, religion and the strength of the welfare state and geography.’ The researchers used data on 131 countries from a number of international surveys including the Gallup World Poll, World Value Survey and the European Quality of Life Surveys. The researchers linked cross-national data on genetic distance and well-being. Whether money can buy happiness or not (stock image shown) is cause for debate, but it seems one sure-fire way to ensure your well-being is simply to have Danish DNA. The new research was published by the German economic research institute IZA in its Discussion Paper series . The second form of evidence looked at existing research suggesting an association between mental wellbeing and a mutation of the gene that influences the re-uptake of serotonin, which is believed to be linked to human mood. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that helps to relay nerve signals. ‘We looked at existing research which suggested that the long and short variants of this gene are correlated with different probabilities of clinical depression, although this link is still highly debated,’ Dr Proto continued. ‘The short version has been associated with higher scores on neuroticism and lower life satisfaction. ‘Intriguingly, among the 30 nations included in the study, it is Denmark and the Netherlands that appear to have the lowest percentage of people with this short version.’ A deficiency of the chemical in the brain is strongly linked to depression while levels are boosted by the drug Ecstasy. Compared with people from other countries, Danes were less likely to possess a short version of the gene linked to low levels of life satisfaction. 'The results were surprising,' said Economist Dr Eugenio Proto from Cage. In this library image a group of folk dancers in California celebrate the 'Danish Days' festival in 1964 . The final piece of evidence looked at whether the link between genetics and happiness also held true across generations, continents and the Atlantic Ocean. Co-author Professor Andrew Oswald, also from the University of Warwick, said: ‘We used data on the reported well-being of Americans and then looked at which part of the world their ancestors had come from. ‘The evidence revealed that there is an unexplained positive correlation between the happiness today of some nations and the observed happiness of Americans whose ancestors came from these nations, even after controlling for personal income and religion. ‘This study has used three kinds of evidence and, contrary to our own assumptions when we began the project, it seems there are reasons to believe that genetic patterns may help researchers to understand international well-being levels. ‘More research in this area is now needed and economists and social scientists may need to pay greater heed to the role of genetic variation across national populations.’","University of Warwick researchers investigated why Danes are so happy .

ff40ccc46b73dbe699c6b9ed0f5114b689aa3849,"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The Los Angeles Times' headquarters aptly sits where the U.S. Army corralled camels during the Civil War, when Southern California was a desert with no natural resources. A new film on PBS explores how the Chandler family helped develop Los Angeles through their newspaper. Los Angeles' development from an arid wasteland to a world metropolis and cultural capital is closely linked to the newspaper's rise under the ownership of one family. ""It would still be a desert,"" documentary filmmaker Peter Jones said, if Gen. Harrison Gray Otis didn't arrive in the 1880s to take over the bankrupt Los Angeles Times and his son-in-law, Harry Chandler, wasn't there to follow him. Jones' documentary is a saga of four generations of the region's most powerful family shaping Los Angeles as they pursued their own civil agendas -- and accumulated wealth. ""Inventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times"" premieres Monday on PBS. Historian David Halberstam said in the documentary that the Chandlers dominated Southern California as no other family has dominated any major region of the United States. ""They did not so much foster the growth of Los Angeles as invent it,"" said Halberstam, who died in 2007. Harrison Gray Otis, Harry Chandler, Norman Chandler and Otis Chandler succeeded each other at the helm of the Los Angeles Times over a span of 100 years. The city grew from a small desert town to the nation's second-largest city, while the family became one of the nation's wealthiest. The Chandler family dynasty ended when the general's great-grandson Otis Chandler was ousted as chairman of the Times board of directors in 1985. The family eventually sold its Times-Mirror Company to Chicago's Tribune Company -- which is now in bankruptcy. Each man's personality and strengths were tailored for what was demanded of their time, said Jones. ""For each era, they were up to that particular era,"" he said. ""You couldn't actually rearrange them,"" said Harry Chandler's namesake and the great-great-grandson of the general. ""You couldn't have a General Otis in late 20th-century America,"" Chandler told CNN, referring to the dynasty's founder who served as an Army general in the Philippine-American War before taking over the Los Angeles Times. ""His character was one of the period. 'I have a vision and everything I touch needs to support that vision and damn the consequences.'"" Otis used his newspaper to scare the public about the threat of drought, drumming up support for a 230-mile aqueduct -- one of the modern engineering marvels -- to divert water from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles, Jones said. He was part of a syndicate that bought vast tracts of barren land in the San Fernando Valley with the inside knowledge the Los Angeles Aqueduct would bring water there. The scandal later inspired Roman Polanski's award-winning film ""Chinatown."" Otis also used the Times to influence the federal government's decision to build the Port of Los Angeles, Jones said. ""He had the foresight to say 'We have to build a man-made harbor here in Los Angeles if we want to become a major port of trade,' and today the Port of Los Angeles is the busiest port in the United States,"" Jones said. The general and his successor son-in-law promoted investment in and migration to the Los Angeles area with stories of sunshine and opportunity. More people moving in meant more readers for their newspaper and demand for the real estate empire they were building. Harrison Gray Otis and Harry Chandler used their newspaper to create a vision of Los Angeles as ""America's Great White Spot"" -- free of crime and communism. They fought a decades-long battle against labor unions -- a battle that included the 1910 bombing of The Los Angeles Times headquarters. The Los Angeles film, aviation, high technology, shipping and oil industries grew from the Chandlers' influence, Jones said. As a conservative Republican family, they helped launch Richard Nixon's political career in post-World War II California. The story is not all about the men. Dorothy Chandler -- the strong-willed wife of Norman Chandler -- waged a relentless campaign to turn Los Angeles into a world-class cultural center, Jones said. She led a campaign to raise money to save the Hollywood Bowl and the Los Angeles Philharmonic. In doing so, she brought together the Westside Jewish community with the white Protestant establishment based in Pasadena, Harry Chandler said. Tom Johnson, who became first nonfamily publisher of the Times in 1980, said one of Dorothy Chandler's ""most remarkable"" contributions was the successful effort to make sure her son Otis succeeded her husband as publisher in 1960. ""The very new approach that Otis took and his leadership of the newspaper was just astounding,"" Johnson said in an interview with CNN. Otis Chandler gave reporters editorial independence, opened news bureaus around the world and strengthened the paper's coverage of the suburbs, Johnson said. Under Otis Chandler, it rose from being one of the worst major papers in the country to being one of the top three, Johnson said. ""It was his goal to make the Los Angeles Times one of the best newspapers, and he did it in 20 years, being the right publisher at the right time,"" Johnson said. But Otis Chandler's transformation of the Times from a conservative newspaper into a Pulitzer Prize-winning rival to the New York Times and Washington Post angered many Chandler family members. ""Some Chandlers were members of the John Birch society; his paper did an expose on it,"" Johnson said. Otis Chandler's newspaper looked closely at the Los Angeles Police Department, ""which had a reputation to shoot first and ask questions,"" Johnson said. The deep family rift eventually led to the sale of the Times-Mirror Company to the Tribune Company -- and the end of the dynasty. Johnson, who left the newspaper in 1989 and later became chairman of CNN, said the paper declined in the years since because ""rather than going for people who were superb newspaper people, they went outside to pick people who, in my opinion, blew the place apart."" Some Chandler family descendants cooperated with Jones' efforts to explore the Chandler family's dealings. ""He doesn't whitewash, but he doesn't dig into the dark side and linger too long,"" said Harry Chandler, the son of Otis Chandler. The documentary is ""on whole, a very balanced, very accomplished, incredibly well researched"" documentary, Chandler said. Jones said he avoided judging the motives of Gen. Otis and his successors. ""When these guys were going about building the city, sometimes they did things, I wouldn't say in an underhanded way, but in a very private way,"" Jones said. ""How do you ascribe motives to people who did things 100 years ago? Was it for greed, avarice and duplicity? History in general is this tangled web of good and evil.""","""Inventing L.A.: The Chandlers and Their Times"" premieres Monday on PBS .

ff4192c80e960edc6ef35fc55be778c8211867fa,"A judge in the murder trial of former NFL star Aaron Hernandez handed his defense pretrial legal victories Friday, throwing out as evidence text messages sent by the homicide victim the night he died and ruling that prosecutors may not tell jurors about two other slayings allegedly committed by the former New England Patriot. Hernandez, wearing a dark suit, sat with his lawyers during the Massachusetts hearing, at times smiling and scribbling notes to his defense team. He has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not introduce the texts that murder victim Odin Lloyd sent his sister shortly before his death. In the texts, Lloyd said that he was with Hernandez, whose trial is scheduled to start next month. Lloyd was dating a sister of Hernandez's fiancee. ""U see who I'm with?"" Lloyd, who was shot and killed on June 17, 2013, wrote in a text. ""NFL,"" he wrote, referring to Hernandez, ""just so you know."" Prosecutor William McCauley said the messages demonstrated Lloyd feared for his life. But defense attorney James Sultan said the texts ""do not suggest fear. They do not suggest knowledge of impending death. They are totally innocuous on their face."" Garsh said the victim's ""state of mind is relevant to motive only if there is reason to believe the defendant knew of it."" Lloyd's texts were not a ""dying declaration,"" the judge said, adding that prosecutors ""do not provide a basis to infer that he was under the belief of imminent death."" Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, left court in tears after the ruling. She later returned. The decision could hurt the case, said Michael McCann, a legal analyst and Sports Illustrated writer. ""The prosecution now has a more difficult case in convincing a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Aaron Hernandez murdered Odin Lloyd,"" he said. ""While there remains incriminating evidence, such as video of Hernandez the night of the murder and an inexplicable use of a cleaning service at Hernandez's home, the loss of Odin Lloyd's text messages is a significant blow to the prosecution."" Authorities have said that Hernandez and two other men picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before he was found shot to death in a North Attleborough, Massachusetts, industrial park. Surveillance cameras at the time captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later. He was with two other people at the time. Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player himself, was not among them. In another defense victory, Garsh ruled that prosecutors may not tell jurors about a separate homicide case involving Hernandez: the July 2012 killings of two men in Boston. In May, Hernandez was charged in the shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who prosecutors say were ambushed and executed as they drove home in Boston's South End on July 16, 2012. In addition to the two counts of first-degree murder, Hernandez also has been charged with three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, prosecutors said. The latter four counts reflect shots fired at three people, one of whom was wounded, inside the car that de Abreu and Furtado were in, according to prosecutors. The prosecution has said that Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the place where the double homicide allegedly took place, giving the former player a possible motive for killing Lloyd. The defense called the theory ""incredible."" Garsh ruled there was no link between the two crimes. She dismissed the theory as ""clearly in the realm of speculation"" and said it ""does not comport with common sense."" The judge also ruled out testimony about Hernandez's February 2013 shooting of Alexander Bradley, a former friend who was allegedly with Hernandez on the night de Abreu and Furtado were killed. Bradley, who was shot in the face, is suing Hernandez in federal court.","A judge throws out as evidence text messages sent by the homicide victim .

They then dumped the severed remains in the middle of a road and lefta bloodied Kumar nearby. Aamir Dhawan, 30, said no one 'went to help' Kumar because they knew he had been punished for a 'sex crime'. Mr Dhawan said: 'We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped. 'This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.' But the police have called for those responsible to come forward, saying people can't take the law into their 'own hands'. Kumar, middle, is stripped naked and awaits his fate, as locals record the punishment he is about to face . The spokesman said: 'As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. 'We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.' Kumar was eventually taken to hospital where doctors described his condition as critical. The girl involved was treated for shock, and given counselling. The castration follows a string of violent sex crimes in India that have prompted vigilante justice. In July, one man was killed and two others were badly hurt after being accused of raping and hanging a seven-year-old girl. The girl was discovered hanging from a tree near the village of Kaliabazar, West Bengal, and angry villagers quickly rounded up a local 'Tantrik' holy man and his two friends. The trio were mercilessly beaten. One later died in hospital and the two others required extensive treatment.

ff4272e3c83d1f3164d3214817c5af6dcbde118e,"(CNN) -- Manchester United have overtaken rivals Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table after a double from Wayne Rooney saw the champions defeat West Bromwich 2-0 on Sunday. Rooney's brace gives the defending champions a one point lead over rivals Manchester City, as Roberto Mancini's side surrendered top spot following a 1-0 defeat at Swansea. Both sides were playing on Sunday following disappointing Europa League defeats on Thursday at the hands of Athletic Bilbao and Sporting Lisbon respectively. United were outplayed in their 3-2 home defeat by Bilbao, but they put that performance behind them to brush aside a 10-man West Bromwich side in comfortable fashion. England striker Rooney made the breakthrough 10 minutes from half-time, diverting Javier Hernandez's cross past former United goalkeeper Ben Foster for his 23rd goal of the season. And United's stranglehold on the game became even stronger midway through the second half when the visitors had Swedish defender Jonas Olsson sent off for a second bookable offense. United made the three points safe in the 71st minute when Rooney scored from the penalty spot after Ashley Young had been brought down by Keith Andrews. Meanwhile, City, who lost 1-0 in Portugal three days previously, were always struggling against a Swansea side that are difficult to beat at home. And the hosts should have taken a sixth minute lead when they were awarded a penalty after Wayne Routledge was fouled by goalkeeper Joe Hart. However, Hart atoned for his error by diving to his right to keep out Scott Sinclair's weak spot-kick. But City's expensively-assembled side struggled throughout the 90 minutes and it was no surprise when they finally fell behind with seven minutes remaining. A mistake from defender Stefan Savic saw Routledge collect the ball, and he crossed for unmarked substitute Luke Moore to head home the winner. Those results see United overtake their neighbors to lead the table on 67 points, one ahead of City, with Tottenham a distant third another 13 points adrift. Meanwhile, Wigan Athletic remain bottom of the table despite recovering to earn a 1-1 draw at Norwich in Sunday's other match. Victor Moses netted a second half equalizer for the visitors and, although Wigan are still propping up the rest of the division, there are just four points between the bottom five teams.","Manchester United defeat West Bromwich 2-0 to go top of the English Premier League .

ff42796f45447c52b11193ecfb48c7b407228896,"CNN)  -- Australian paceman Peter Siddle took six wickets including a hat-trick as England were skittled for 260 on the first day of the Ashes series at the Gabba in Brisbane. The home side were 25 without loss in reply at the close with Simon Katich 15 not out and Shane Watson on nine, the openers having survived a testing half hour to round off a superb day for Ricky Ponting's men. But it was the heroics of birthday boy Siddle, 26 today, which put them in a strong position with his hat-trick the 11th by an Australian in Test cricket history. England were 197 for four wickets when he struck, removing Alastair Cook for 67 then Matt Prior and Stuart Broad for ducks in successive balls. ""It was amazing, but I hope it's just the start of a great series for us. I was just trying to bowl fast, pitch it up and get it straight and they were three good players to get out,"" Siddle told Sky Sports. ""It's a good list to join, Australian hat-tricks in Test cricket."" A battling 76 by Ian Bell until he was the ninth man out to Test debutant Xavier Doherty lifted England to some respectability. Journeyman left-arm spinner Doherty, a surprise inclusion in the Australian team, wrapped up the England innings in the same over as he bowled James Anderson to finish with two wickets for 41. England had begun their previous series in Australia, which resulted in a 5-0 thrashing, in disastrous fashion with paceman Steve Harmison's well-chronicled wide. This time around, it was scarcely better as captain Andrew Strauss was dismissed for a duck to the third ball of the morning, edging Ben Hilfenhaus to Mike Hussey at gully. Blog: England's Ashes hopes could turn to dust . Cook and Jonathan Trott set about repairing the damage on a wicket with a green tinge and helpful to the bowlers, but with the score on 41, all-rounder Watson bowled Trott for 29. Kevin Pietersen played well for his 43, but Siddle accounted for him and Paul Collingwood for just 4 in his second spell as he found the right length to bowl on the slow surface. Bell and Cook looked to be lifting England into a strong position, but Siddle, returning again to the fray, then struck in devastating fashion and also later accounted for Graeme Swann to finish with six wickets for 54. Bell, who had been in fine form in the warm-up game in Tasmania, continued where he left off, but attempting to up the scoring rate only chipped a Doherty delivery to Watson in the covers. England, who hold the Ashes having beaten Australia on home soil in 2009, have gone into the series as narrow favorites but will have work to do on the second day of the first Test, if they are to prevent the home side from building up a sizeable first innings lead.","Peter Siddle takes hat-trick as England dismissed for 260 in first Test in Australia .

Escape: A manhunt is underway for Andrew Farndon after he was freed from a taxi as he was taken to hospital after apparently stabbing himself . Dramatic new CCTV footage has emerged revealing the incredible moment a second prisoner in a week was sprung from a taxi at gunpoint. A manhunt is under way today after two prison officers were threatened at gunpoint and forced to release 26-year-old Andrew Farndon. The pictures released by Suffolk police show the gunman approaching the vehicle and two men fleeing the scene outside West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmonds. Farndon was being taken to the hospital from HMP Highpoint, a Category C prison 12 miles away, after he had apparently stabbed himself in order to carry out the plan. It is the second time Farndon has escaped from custody, having leapt from the dock during his 2007 court case over a violent attack. He was serving an indeterminate sentence for causing grievous bodily harm in 2007 with a minimum two-year jail term. He was due to undergo treatment at the hospital's accident and emergency department, but instead a waiting gunman confronted the male and female guards and fled with Farndon across a car park. A police manhunt is now under way following the incident at 6.40pm yesterday evening. Hospital staff contacted police saying they saw the prison security officers being threatened with a gun, and the officers rang to confirm they had been ambushed. Racing away: CCTV images issued by Suffolk Police show a gunman approaching the scene at West Suffolk Hospital, left, and then leaving with prisoner Andrew Farndon, right . Witnesses: Police want to speak to these people, who they believe may have witnessed the incident . Investigating: A police car is seen outside West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds, where the escape took place . Detective Chief Inspector Nick Bennett said armed response officers arrived on the scene within five minutes. He said Farndon had been taken to hospital in a saloon from a local taxi firm, believed to be A1 Taxis in Bury St Edmunds. The company refused to comment. Mr Bennett said he understood it was standard practice to transport prisoners to hospital by taxi unless there was a 'specific risk'. He added: 'He was handcuffed to a female prison officer who removed the handcuffs when a handgun was pointed at her head. A male prison officer was also escorting him.' Searches were continuing in Suffolk but Mr Bennett said it was unlikely Farndon was still in the county. Forces across Britain, including the neighbouring counties of Norfolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire, along with West Midlands Police, have issued appeals for information. Mr Bennett added: 'Along with other forces, we are pursuing various lines of inquiry, including contacting his family, friends and associates in the West Midlands. 'We are also studying CCTV and number-plate recognition records to try to identify the car which was used in the escape. 'Another line of inquiry is whether any mobile phones were used in the planning and execution of this escape. 'His prison cell has been searched and various items recovered. No blade was found in this search. 'The prison officers are still shaken and it was obviously a terrifying ordeal.' A spokesman for Suffolk Police said: . 'Officers were contacted just after 6.50pm by staff at the Accident . & Emergency reception of the West Suffolk Hospital at Hardwick Lane . in Bury St Edmunds who reported they could see a man with a gun outside . the A&E department. 'They said the man was pointing the weapon at two prison officers. 'Moments later police received a second call from the prison officers, from HMP Highpoint, who said they had a gun pulled on them by a man who had confronted them as they had arrived at A&E with a prisoner who had been stabbed in an incident at the prison.' Farndon - whose family live in the Coventry area - is white, with a shaved head and goatee beard, and was wearing a dark blue baseball cap with a light-coloured jumper, padded on the right side due to his injury to the shoulder. Scene: Staff at West Suffolk Hospital reported seeing a man wielding a gun, which he aimed in the direction of two officers who were guarding Farndon . On guard: A police officer stands outside the entrance to the A&E department following the incident . HMP Highpoint, a Category C prison with around 380 inmates where Andrew Farden was being held . The gunman was also white, in his mid-40s, about 5ft 8ins tall and is believed to have had a Scottish accent. The release of Farndon is the second in a week after John Anslow (pictured) was sprung from a prison van . He was wearing a white top and blue jeans and it is thought they escaped in a dark-coloured car and may have had accomplices. Police are advising members of the public not to approach the men if they see them. The . escape is the second in just a week, after category A prisoner John . Anslow was sprung from a prison van after it left Hewell Prison in . Worcestershire. Justice minister Crispin Blunt said there was no suggestion Farndon's escape was linked to Monday's incident. 'Clearly, we will be examining the circumstances,' he said. 'The most important thing at the moment is to get this man back in custody and to investigate the full facts of the case.' A Prison Service spokeswoman said a full Prison Service inquiry would follow. Former convict Mark Leech, editor of the national prisoners' newspaper Converse, called for a full inquiry into how both escapes were possible. 'Forget reform, rehabilitation or reducing reoffending, the first and primary function of the Prison Service is security,' he said. 'How is it that security intelligence at these prisons missed completely both of these clearly pre-planned escapes?' Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke has ordered an inquiry into how Anslow, described as 'extremely dangerous' by police, became the first category A prisoner to escape in more than 17 years on Monday. Instead of being transferred in a high-security prison service van with a police escort, Anslow was with other inmates in a van run by a private contractor. Three masked men ambushed the van, . smashing its windows with sledgehammers and punching the driver as he . was transporting inmates from the prison near Redditch to Stafford Crown . Court on Monday morning. An international manhunt has been launched for Anslow with police liaising with other UK forces, the UK Border Agency and foreign authorities. The search extends to all airports and railway stations. Anslow, also known as Skitz, has strong connections across the country, including London, as well as overseas, police said. A 44-year-old Tipton man arrested on Monday night on suspicion of helping Anslow to escape was released on bail pending further inquiries last night, police said.","Andrew Farndon, 26, 'stabbed himself' and was outside hospital when the raid took place .

'Tenacious': Daphne Smallman, of Solihull, West Midlands, who died of cancer aged 78 in February, stood up to Tesco over the pricing issue . Tesco has been fined £300,000 in a landmark court case after it misled thousands of shoppers with a bogus half-price strawberry promotion. The supermarket admitted four offences linked to the sale of punnets of strawberries in 2,300 stores across the country at a ‘half-price’ figure of £1.99. Britain’s biggest grocer used an original price of £3.99 to justify the bargain claim. However, this higher figure only applied for a very short period. Tesco has admitted the claims of big savings were misleading and it has now been fined £300,000 and ordered to pay £65,000 in costs. The ruling will serve as a warning to all supermarkets, who stand accused of using a raft of underhand tactics to tempt shoppers through the doors. Birmingham Crown Court heard that the half-price promotion was instrumental in generating strawberry sales of some £52million with a profit of £2.3million. Judge Michael Chambers QC said: ‘The promotion was not a genuine bargain. It was false and misleading. The offer should never have been made in the first place by a national retailer. It was patently wrong.’ He said the case was ‘shocking by its very nature’ because consumers had a ‘high degree of trust’ in chains such as Tesco. As a result, he decided to levy what is a very large fine in terms of trading standards law. In court: Supermarket giant Tesco has been fined £300,000 for misleading the public over a half-price offer on punnets of strawberries . The case only reached the courts . thanks to the tenacity of elderly shopper Daphne Smallman, who saw the . strawberry bargain claims when in a Tesco at Sheldon, Birmingham, in the . summer of 2011. It turned . out that the £3.99 figure had applied for a very short period, however . the half-price deal ran for a much longer 14 weeks through the summer. This was at odds with guidelines in the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations Act 2008. A . general rule of thumb is that an offer price should not carry on for a . longer period than an item was sold at its full price. Fined: The case concerned a Tesco store in Sheldon, Birmingham, after it was brought to trading standards officials' attention . Mrs Smallman . understood that the original price of £3.99 might have been fair at the . start of the strawberry season when the fruit was still in short supply. Praise: Daphne Smallman's friend Sonia Lewis (pictured), 79, said the late campaigner 'would be pleased to know something had been done' However, she knew it was . unfair to keep using this high figure when strawberries were plentiful . and farmers were supplying them at low prices. It . is exactly this tactic that all of the supermarkets have used for years . to give the impression they are offering bargains on seasonal fruit and . vegetables. Mrs Smallman . was identified in court as making the complaint, however, she died . earlier this year, aged 78, before the case was resolved. She . took up the matter with her local trading standards office which . pursued the case to the point that Tesco felt it had no choice but to . admit misleading shoppers. Birmingham . council’s head of trading standards, Sajeela Naseer, stressed the . ruling was significant for the way products were promoted in future. ‘Food pricing, presentation and the depiction of promotional practices . is a crucial issue for retailers, and in turn, consumers.’ Tesco . had tried to kill off the prosecution earlier this year by arguing that . Birmingham council did not have the power to pursue a case involving . offences outside its borders. Yesterday, . however the store admitted its guilt, although it insisted the . misleading promotion was the result of a one-off human error, rather . than a wider attempt to deceive customers. A . store spokesman said: ‘We sell over 40,000 products in our stores, with . thousands on promotion at any one time, but even one mistake is one too . many.","Customer Daphne Smallman stood up to Tesco in fight over £1.99 punnets .

ff42e5b1da35ad6660f05e43c023f7fcf9c7cdde,"(CNN) -- It was a year ago that 13-year-old Jon Carmichael committed suicide, hanging himself in a barn near his home in Cleburne, Texas. Monday, on the anniversary of his death, his parents, Jon Timothy and Tami Carmichael, filed a $20 million federal lawsuit against several officials at the school Jon attended, alleging they deliberately turned a blind eye to the bullying of their son, prompting his death. In the lawsuit, documents state that staff and students at The Joshua Independent School District observed several explicit acts of bullying, including Jon being thrown into a trash can ""easily a few times a week,"" but did nothing to stop it. ""He was placed upside down in a toilet bowl, and had his head flushed several times, at each occasion. These acts were observed by other students who failed to report the incident,"" the documents said. ""Just prior to his death he was stripped nude, tied up and again placed into a trashcan."" The lawsuit states that event was taped and put on YouTube, but was taken down ""at the direction of an unknown staff member, who also failed to report the incident."" Carmichael family attorney Martin J. Cirkiel said the family's goal in issuing the lawsuit is to educate. ""On the human level, the family wants what every family wants when they come to me in these kind of cases. They want to make sure it doesn't happen to someone else."" Cirkiel said the family would like to see a program developed in their son's name and to be able to open a trust fund for kids who need it who are being bullied. ""They want to increase planning and education,"" he said. Joshua Independent School District Superintendent Ray Dane said he hadn't seen the lawsuit and could not comment, but that the school has had teaching mechanisms on bullying in place for at least the duration of his 12-year tenure there. ""We do what we can to train and remind students and staff that bullying is something we always have to be aware of,"" he said. ""We've even got a student-led program where students lead other students about bullying and teaching them about our differences."" Additionally, the district has implemented a new anonymous reporting system called ""Talk About It"" -- a way for secondary students to report bullying without feeling pressure to attach their names. The program began last year at the middle school and expanded to the high school this year, Dane said. The lawsuit acknowledges the school's rules of conduct but says it failed. ""Even though the district ostensibly had a policy in place to deal with known incidents of bullying and harassment, school district personnel clearly had an actual practice and custom of looking the other way,"" it states. Dane said the climate in the Joshua school halls is overall very positive and sensitive to bullying issues. ""I would say that we've never had many reports of bullying in the school system. Are people more aware? Yes, because we're trying to make people more aware about the issue and being sensitive. Being kind to each other and doing things that one would expect them to."" Cirkiel said the Carmichaels had a memorial ceremony Monday for their son. ""They want their son's life and death to have meaning,"" Cirkiel said.

Short supply: Hospital bosses have been forced abroad in their hunt for staff (file photo) One in three hospitals is bringing in nurses from abroad because wards are so understaffed, an investigation has found. NHS managers are travelling to countries including Poland, Greece, Spain, Portugal, India and the Philippines in the drive to recruit nurses. But concerns have been raised over the English-speaking abilities of some foreign staff, while others may lack training and experience. And MPs and campaigners say it is absurd some hospitals are making nurses redundant or have imposed recruitment freezes while others are desperately having to poach them from abroad. Separate figures from the Nursing and Midwifery Council show the number of foreign nurses coming to work in Britain has doubled in just three years, up from 2,306 to 4,521. This means nearly a fifth of the 25,500 new nurses registering each year are from abroad. An investigation by Nursing Times using Freedom of Information requests found that 40 out of 105 hospital trusts have actively recruited nurses from abroad within the past 12 months. In total they had poached some 1,360 nurses from abroad. But over the past few years concerns have been raised over the poor language and medical skills of nurses – and doctors – working for the NHS, with some patients claiming they have had to use sign language. Some of Britain’s foremost doctors have expressed their own frustration – including Lord Winston, a fertility specialist, who warned that nurses from Eastern Europe have been ‘trained in a completely different way’. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association said: ‘In all of the caring services, good communications is vitally important for a number of reasons. ‘If language issues prevent this level of communication then clearly patient care will suffer and safety is compromised.’ The NMC’s figures also show three quarters of the foreign nurses that registered to work in Britain last year were from European countries and therefore did not face language or skills checks. Influx: Figures have revealed that one in three hospitals are bringing in foreign nurses, who now make up a fifth of all newly-registered nurses . EU rules prohibit such tests being carried out on nurses from member states as they are deemed a threat to ‘freedom of labour’. Only last month research by Kings College London found more than 40 per cent of hospital wards did not have enough nurses to run safely. And this summer an investigation into hospitals with the highest death rates by the NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh found evidence of widespread nursing shortages. Although the numbers of nurses working in the NHS increased by more than a fifth under Labour, over the past three years they have begun falling again. Figures show there are now 5,000 fewer posts compared to April 2010 and some trusts have been making staff redundant. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Recruiting from abroad is nothing new. Overseas nurses make a very valuable contribution to NHS patient care. 'However, they should only ever work in the NHS if they have proven their competence and language skills.’","40 out of 105 hospital trusts are recruiting from abroad, new figures show .

But critics have accused police of withdrawing from landmark high street buildings in many towns and cities simply to cut costs. Simon Reed, vice-chairman of the Police Federation, lashed out at forces . for closing ‘places of refuge’ for crime victims. He said: ‘These . drop-in centres are no substitute for a proper police station and for a . lot of people they are not the answer. Axe: 5,800 frontline police officers face the axe over the next three years because of Government spending cuts . ‘In many cases they have taken away a police station and given the . public a part-time office in a supermarket or a mobile home left in a . car park. ‘The public want a police station with full facilities, a place of . refuge and safety. What we are doing is abandoning this and providing a . drop-in point instead.’ The closures were disclosed yesterday in a report by a police watchdog . into how police forces in England and Wales are coping with tighter . budgets. Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary found crime continues to fall . and confidence in police remains high despite substantial cuts in . government funding. Its report said the total police workforce will fall by 32,400 officers and staff by 2015. Among these will be 5,800 frontline officers although many forces have . reorganised to put a larger proportion of bobbies on the beat. However, Paul McKeever, of the Police Federation, argued that some . forces have simply created a ‘smokescreen’ by moving officers to the . front line from other important roles. He added: ‘Whichever way you cut it, the resilience of the police . service to be able to react to whatever is thrown at it is being . threatened.’ Funding black hole: The Metropolitan Police still have to make a further £233million worth of funding cuts . Spending on equipment and services will also be cut by about £474million . as chief constables look to reorganise and share contracts to save . cash. Sir Denis O’Connor, Chief Inspector of Constabulary, argued that  forces . can save the jobs of dozens of police officers by selling off costly . buildings. He said: ‘The police station and front counter have traditionally been the physical mainstay of forces’ presence in communities. ‘However, the potential savings benefit to a force in shrinking its . estate can be considerable. One reports it will save £500,000 in 2013/14 . rising to £1.6million in 2014/15.’ He said the frontline officers he . has met are ‘cracking on with the mission’, working imaginatively to . maintain services whatever difficulties they face. The latest cuts figures do not include Britain’s biggest force, the Met, . which has not produced detailed budget plans or officer numbers. Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe is reassembling his management team . following a string of  resignations and a shake-up of how the force is . overseen. Officials warned his force was in danger of severe failings . when cuts bite after the Olympics and it already has a budget shortfall . of more than £233million. Two other forces, Lincolnshire and Devon & Cornwall, were also . singled out as potentially failing to provide an ‘efficient and . effective’ service in the future. Chief Constable Steve Finnigan, of the Association of Chief Police . Officers, said: ‘We are becoming more flexible in the way we deliver . critical services such as neighbourhood policing, local response teams . and investigative work.’ Policing minister Nick Herbert defended the cuts, saying: ‘This report . makes it clear that the frontline of policing is being protected overall . and that the service to the public has largely been maintained.’","264 front desks will be closed - meaning the public cannot cannot walk in to report crime .

You would never believe that his stunning pictures of sunrises and sunsets, captured from inside rolling waves, were taken literally just off these shores - on the coast of Cornwall. Mr Morse, 22, has been capturing incredible images of daybreak and twilight from the sea for five years, and they give us views normally reserved for the very bravest of surfers - from inside the barrels of waves. Callum Morse, 22, lives in St Ives, Cornwall, but people struggle to believe him when he tells them his photos were taken there and not in Hawaii or the Canary Islands. This photo was taken at sunset in St Ives Bay (Hayle) This image, taken at Porthtowan, gives  a rare glimpse into the lives of the bravest of surfers, seeing sunrises and sunsets as never before - through the barrel of a wave . The sunrises create some incredible, vivid colours as they catch the tips of the crashing waves, like these at St Ives Bay (Hayle) The St Ives man is extremely dedicated to his cause -  he will wade out into freezing waters in the early hours while it is still dark to make sure he catches the sunrise. He is constantly battered against rocks and has been seriously injured before, but it is all worth it when he sees the faces of people who cannot believe his photos were taken just minutes from their homes. 'I'm addicted to trying to get the perfect shot and that's what keeps me out in the waves,' he said. Mr Morse has seriously injured himself while taking the photos before - his camera crashed into his head and split it open, but it has not deterred him from continuing, This photo was taken at Godrevy . The surf instructor goes all over Cornwall to take the photographs, which he then compiles into calendars and sells. This one is from Porthmeor (St Ives) 'It is grey most of the time in Cornwall but it can look quite tropical especially when the sun is coming up. 'A lot of people are surprised to find out that my pictures were taken in the UK - people think these pictures must have been taken in Hawaii or the Canary Islands. 'Even the local surfers who know the coast here better than anyone think they could not have been taken in Cornwall.' Mr Morse heads down to the beaches like Godrevy  in the early hours and gets into the sea while it is still dark so that he is prepared to capture that perfect sunrise photo . He will spend hours in the water at places like this in Porthleven - as long as five at a time, and says that he can only ever be found in the sea or in the pub . Mr Morse has a girlfriend of two years, 21-year-old Holly Lanyon, also from St Ives, and luckily, she doesn't mind that her boyfriend spends so much time in the sea. 'She is pretty cool about me being in the water all the time,' he said. 'She doesn't come out with me when I take my pictures, I prefer being by myself to take them. 'Since we have been together I have taught her how to surf, so we both do spend some time together in the sea.' Mr Morse takes pictures all over Cornwall and sells calendars featuring his pictures. Some of his snaps hang in local restaurants and hotels. Mr Morse has been taking the unique photographs for five years, starting out when he was just a teenager. This one comes from Porthleven . Mr Morse is often smashed into rocks and back onto the sand by large powerful waves, but says the knocks and scrapes are worth the end result. This huge wave was captured at Watergate Bay in Newquay . He often spends as long as five hours in the water with his Canon EOS 7D SLR, waiting to capture the perfect picture from inside a wave. 'I'm rarely out of the sea. I'm either in the water or in the pub,' he said. 'I try and wait for the magic hour - the hour around sunrise and the hour around sunset. 'This means I'll get in the water when its dark and get straight in the sea to wait for the sun to come up. 'I can be in the water for hours - basically until I fill up my memory card.' The impressive photographer often does not leave the water until he has filled up his entire memory card with images like this, from Watergate Bay . Cornwall is one of the best areas of the UK for surfing, along with neighbouring county Devon, as well as parts of Wales and Scotland. This was was snapped at Godrevy . The bold wave-rider said he has severely hurt himself before, while trying to photograph the crashing waves, but says that comes as part and parcel of what he does. 'To take the pictures you need to stand right in the impact zone, the area where the wave curls over,' he said. 'If you want to get the shot you have to put yourself in a position where you will get crumpled up on the beach or smashed up into the sand. 'I split my head open with the waterproof housing on my camera once. The wave hit the camera and the camera hit me in the face and I caught the sharp edge of the housing. 'Sometimes I shoot on a shallow reef, so when the wave hits I get smashed into the rocks. 'It doesn't deter me at all because I love getting the pictures, and who cares about a few scratches and bumps?' A green-blue wave rolls towards the camera at sunset at Godrevy, the colour of the water contrasting with the reds and oranges in the sky .","Callum Morse, 22, spends as long as five hours in the water at a time with his Canon EOS 7D SLR .

ff447f516d3ee25fa5debe5f040a4722a5989868,"(CNN) -- Villarreal have sacked coach Ernesto Valverde following Sunday's 2-0 Spanish Primera Liga defeat at home to Osasuna. Valverde only took over at Villarreal in the summer following Manuel Pellegrini's departure to Real Madrid. However, the Yellow Submarines, who finished fifth last year, have had a disappointing season and are 10th in the table following Sunday's loss. ""Villarreal have cancelled their contract with coach Ernesto Valverde after the defeat against Osasuna,"" the club confirmed in a statement on their official Web site. ""The club thank the coach for his services and wish him the best of luck in his sporting career."" Villarreal, who have been linked with former Getafe coach Michael Laudrup, have said they will name Valverde's replacement in the next few days. Despite a recent draw against Barcelona at the Nou Camp, Valverde has paid the price for an inconsistent season which has also seen the club crash out of the Spanish Cup to second division side Celta Vigo. The 45-year-old becomes the sixth coach to lose his job in the Spanish top flight this season following the departures of Abel Resino (Atletico Madrid), Juan Carlos Mandia (Racing Santander), Marcelino Garcia Toral (Real Zaragoza), and Hugo Sanchez and Jose Angel Ziganda (both Xerez). Meanwhile, on the pitch, Sevilla moved up to fourth place in the table as a double from Alvaro Negredo -- the second a superb chip -- earned them a 2-1 home victory over third-placed Valencia. David Navarro headed a late consolation for Valencia but they were unable to prevent Sevilla moving to withing three points of them. In earlier matches, European-chasing Getafe were held to a 0-0 by a Racing Santander side who played almost the entire second half with 10 men after Jose Moratan was dismissed for two bookings. And Atletico Madrid were jeered off by their own fans after slumping 2-0 at home to Malaga, their ninth defeat of the season.","Spanish Primera Liga side Villarreal dismiss coach Ernesto Valverde .

Millions of U.S. children are living with mental health disorders, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC looked at the rates of various mental health conditions among American children for its first comprehensive report on the state of mental health among children aged between 3 and 17. About one in five children of these ages have a mental health disorder, according to the CDC, and the numbers seem to be going up as does the cost of health care associated with the conditions. CDC: One in five children between ages 3-17 have a mental health disorder . 'Millions of children in the U.S. have mental disorders that affect their overall health and present challenges for their loved ones. In addition, the financial costs of childhood mental disorders are at least an estimated $247 billion each year,' Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said in a news release. 'We are working to both increase our understanding of these disorders, and help scale up programs and strategies to promote children's mental health so that our children grow to lead productive, healthy lives.' Childhood mental health disorders include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorders, behavior disorders, mood and anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and Tourette Syndrome. CDC researchers worked alongside other federal health agencies in order to come up with the number of children diagnosed with mental health disorders between 2005 and 2011. Pricey: The costs of childhood mental disorders are at least an estimated $247 billion a year . They found ADHD was the most prevalent disorder affecting nearly 7 percent of U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 17. Behavioral or conduct problems followed affecting 3.5 percent of children, then anxiety (3 percent), depression (2 percent), autism (1 percent) and Tourette's (0.2 percent for 6 to 17-year-olds). The CDC in March reported one in 50 U.S. school children have some form of autism. This is significantly higher than the one in 88 estimate put forward by the government last year, . Older adolescents, from ages 12 to 17, were tracked for substance abuse disorders. Prevalent: ADHD is the most prevalent disorder affecting nearly 7 percent of U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 17 . The report showed nearly 5 percent of them used an illicit drug within the past year, more than 4 percent said they used alcohol, and almost 3 percent admitted cigarette dependence within the past month. The CDC hopes to better understand the impact of these mental health disorders to inform needs for treatment and intervention strategies. Children with the disorders are also more likely to have chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, and epilepsy than children without mental health problems. The disorders can also last into adulthood, increasing risk for decreased productivity, substance use and injury, and substantial costs both to the individual and the U.S. economy. The CDC also pointed out that suicide, the second-leading cause of death among adolescents between 12 and 17, can result from the interaction of mental health disorders and other factors.","A fifth of all children may have mental disorders - ADHD is the most common .
More adolescents have disorders that previously thought .
However, experts say normal responses to life's challenges are too often labeled disorders .

Massage therapists rub the nervous tensions of men and women away. Scissors skillfully cut men's hair. Two chandeliers adorn the main room, complimented by brick walls and a glass bar that doubles as a retail counter. Sean Heywood, right, and Kumi Walker own MR., a barbershop and wine bar in San Francisco, California. This is not your typical barbershop. And that has always been the vision of owners Kumi Walker and Sean Heywood. ""We are literally trying to create a new version of the country club golf experience. But we're replacing golf with haircuts, and we're putting it in urban environments,"" says Heywood. MR. (for mister) is their first business venture. It's an upscale barbershop, wine bar and lounge in the financial district of San Francisco where memberships cost $65 to $250 a month. In addition to the basic services, those who become members benefit from exclusive services like golf putting clinics and human resource workshops. ""We're trying to thrive, not just survive,"" Heywood said. MR. takes the cultural aspect of the black barbershop experience and modernizes it, making it a place where businesspeople of all races can network. ""We looked at our social lives, and we had black friends, Asian friends, Latino friends, white friends. We would do a lot of things socially together, but when it came to getting our hair cut, we would all split up,"" Walker says.  Watch Walker talk about the difficulty of starting and running a business » . The two entrepreneurs are bridging a cultural divide, and also giving back to the community. They offer free lifetime memberships to MR. to those in good standing with a re-entry program called Back on Track. Among other things, Back on Track offers first-time, low-level criminal offenders GED preparation, tutoring, money-management instruction and job training and placement. And that's where MR. steps in. The membership provides them with one free haircut, trim, and shoeshine monthly. ""We'll take care of their grooming so that they don't have to. And they're ready for all the different jobs that they pursue going forward,"" Walker says. Giving back is paramount for the entrepreneurs. And the story of one black business district in Tulsa, Oklahoma, inspires them. It was known as Black Wall Street, and it was destroyed in a race riot and fire 88 years ago. ""All of the businesses that we wanted to create, we wanted to encompass the culture of, if that community still existed today, what it would look like,"" says Walker, who says he read about the riot six years ago. Imagine a credit union, a barbershop, a library, and men in freshly pressed suits with top hats sauntering on sidewalks. The melodic sounds of jazz flow into the streets from several nightclubs. A thriving community of black-owned businesses serve their clientele across a 42-block area. That was the community that existed in the segregated neighborhood of Greenwood from 1830 to 1921. But on the evening of May 31, 1921, white mobs entered Greenwood with torches and guns. Black residents gathered to protect a young man accused of assaulting a white woman. When the smoke from fires cleared on June 1, more than 1,000 homes, businesses and other institutions were burned or destroyed, according to the report of the Oklahoma Commission to Study the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. ""People came and said, 'Run, they are shooting people,' "" says Wess Young, who was 4 then. ""We evacuated. They were destroying everything."" The death toll has been debated for years, because many victims were dumped in mass graves. An American Red Cross estimate puts the total at 300, much higher than the 36 reported by local officials. The riot devastated the social underpinnings of the Greenwood community and leveled a black economic force. Greenwood was rebuilt, but it never recovered. ""It was a really tragic end to thriving businesses. I think we'd be a lot further ahead had that area been able to continue to thrive,"" says Walker. Wess Young and his family rebuilt their lives in Tulsa. When asked what he thought America would be like if the Tulsa race riot had not happened, he answers without hesitation, ""We would have had a black president before now. ... He has done a good job, but we [blacks are] still in a box."" His advice to people is to let go of the past once they've learned from it. ""Hate will destroy your whole universe -- got to learn how to forgive, but never forget,"" Young says. Walker says these stories of black struggle and survival motivate him. ""I stand on the shoulders of my ancestors,"" he says.

ff451dbe7af1c41aa1baa083f21aff7cc951501f,"An American photographer held hostage by Syrian rebels for seven months has told of his horrors in dealing with the FBI after he managed to escape. Still recovering: Matthew Schrier, 36, was held by Syrian rebels with al-Qaeda links for seven months . Matthew Schrier, from Syosset, New York, was captured by Jabhat al-Nusra, a militant group aligned with al-Qaeda, as he traveled in Syria in December 2012. He was taken to a compound near Aleppo and locked up before escaping from a gap in a basement window on July 29 last year, he said. Now the 36-year-old has revealed the shocking treatment he suffered by during and after his ordeal because of the FBI - including being forced to reimburse the State Department the $1,605 they paid for Schrier's flight home. In a new interview with McClatchy DC, Schrier said the FBI waited six months to contact his family to let them know he had been captured. He previously said that the rebels had emailed his parents pretending to be him and assuring them he was fine. With his parents none the wiser, Schrier's captors were able to drain his bank account of $17,000. The next time the FBI calls me will be the first time,' said Schrier's father, Jeffrey, outside Fort Lauderdale, Florida, told McClatchy. 'I thank God my son was able to escape, because if he was waiting for the government to spring him he would still be waiting in that hellhole.' Once Schrier was back in the US, it was a matter of weeks before he recieved the bill for his airfare. He says that a psychiatrist assigned to help him with the experience and his return cancelled five times in the first two months. He was put up in a hotel for one month after his return, but after that time the FBI suggested he go to a homeless shelter. Held: Schrier says that he was beaten, electrocuted and robbed by the rebels after they kidnapped him in December 2012. He since claims to have been treated terribly by the FBI . Locked up: The compound where Schier was kept was near Aleppo, where a Free Syrian Army fighter is pictured above . Schrier waited five months to receive a new ID and Social Security number, after his cards were stolen, copied and used multiple times. 'It is like a scam. I don't understand what they do, victims services,' Schrier told McClatchy. 'The FBI has made it impossible for me to recover.' Before he fled, Schrier said he was beaten with a metal cable across his feet and given electrical shocks. Schrier was one of several Westerners in rebel-held territory since the civil war began. He said he was traveling without a commission from a media organization and had attempted to leave Aleppo by taxi on December 31. But the vehicle was stopped and he was taken by the rebels. Schrier was also whipped with cable on the soles of his feet while his knees were wedged in a car tire, and he was questioned by men speaking fluent English whom he guessed were Canadian. Schrier's mother grew worried about getting no word from her son and reported him missing to the State Department on January 31 - exactly one month after he was taken. Alone: The New York man was working as a freelance photographer when he was taken on December 31, 2012 . Schrier's mother did not realize at first that he was just one of several Americans being held hostage in Syria, McClatchy reported. Upon learning of it, she discovered there were missing-persons posters for other hostages but not one for her son. Schrier said when she contacted the FBI to asked why this was, they quickly put a poster up online. Schrier eventually slipped from a gap in a basement window early on July 29, he said, leaving behind his cellmate. Schrier said he was able to stand on his cellmate's back and unravel a wire mesh covering a window. Just before dawn, he wriggled out but the cellmate got stuck. Schrier said he walked to a road and flagged a car. Rebels: Schrier was held by Jabhat al-Nusra; a member is seen riding a motorcycle in Deir al-ZorRead . He was able to get a ride to the Turkey border, where he was helped by American officials. The White House told McClatchy that they would not comment on Schrier's new claims. The FBI released a statement over the interview. 'When an American is detained illegally overseas, the FBI's top priority is ensuring the safe return of that individual,' the statement said. 'To that end the FBI provides support services to victims and their families, to include help in meeting short-term exigent needs, and shares information about their loved ones that is timely and appropriate.' Earlier this month the Obama administration said it was reviewing the way government agencies handle hostages and their families after three American hostages were beheaded in Syria.","Matthew Schrier was working as a freelance photographer when he was captured by al-Qaeda-linked rebels last December 2012 .

The summer arrivals have looked like a well-established partnership in their last two games for the Hammers, both getting amongst the goals in the draw at Hull and Saturday's impressive 3-1 victory over Liverpool. Sakho, 24, joined from Metz having led the scoring charts for the French outfit as they gained promotion to Ligue 1 and has since scored three goals in three starts for West Ham. Diafra Sakho celebrates with strike partner Enner Valencia after scoring  in West Ham's 3-1 win over Liverpool . His goal on Saturday came after Winston Reid's opener as he deftly lofted the ball over stranded Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and, whilst confirming he meant the audacious effort, the Senegal international is ready to work on his blossoming understanding with Valencia. 'I saw the 'keeper off his line, at the near post, and I only had one thing in mind,' he told West Ham TV. 'I tried it and it came off. I wasn't sure if it was going to go in or not, but thankfully it's ended up in the net. I'm pleased, pleased for me and for the team. I've dreamed of scoring a goal as good as that, particularly here at the Boleyn Ground.' Sakho, chipped in a sublime goal against Liverpool on Saturday, has become an instant hit at West Ham . Regarding Valencia, he added: 'We've trained together for a short while now. Enner's a footballer who likes to get it down and play, and me, I like to come deep. I try to position myself in relation to him and vice-versa. I hope that's going to continue to serve the club well this season. 'We're working every day in training for that. We're not going to relax and we'll carry on working hard at it, because it's only the beginning of the season and there will be plenty of matches to play together.' West Ham boss Sam Allardyce believes Sakho has benefited from the spotlight being drawn by the big-money signing of Valencia, who starred at the World Cup for Ecuador. Sakho competes with his namesake and Liverpool defender Mamadou during the clash at Upton Park . The duo will both be licking their lips at the prospect of coming up against Manchester United's shaky defence on Saturday but, even if the goals start to dry up for Sakho, he is ready to do his bit for the team as West Ham look to build on their win over Liverpool. 'Goals are why I'm here and that's why West Ham signed me,' he added. 'But beyond that I'll try to help the team, as much as I possibly can. And even if I don't score, as long as I'm useful, that's the important thing. I work every day in training to try to be as effective as possible. 'We deserved it (the result against Liverpool). On the whole, we lived up to manager's expectations and those of the staff. And if we continue to play like that, work together, united as a group, we'll do good things in the Premier League.'

Announcing his retirement, Scholes told the official club website: . ""This was not a decision that I have taken lightly but I feel now is the right time for me to stop playing. ""To have been part of the team that helped the club reach that 19th (record) title is a great privilege.

""We are going to miss a truly unbelievable player. ""Paul has always been fully committed to this club and I am delighted he will be joining the coaching staff from next season.""

ff46bdff94f22a8993b3f24c021dea29c8b85dab,"(CNN) -- Forces loyal to Alassane Ouattara took control of state-run television and attacked the residence of Laurent Gbagbo on Friday as Ivory Coast's bloody, four-month battle for political power appeared to enter its final stages . Artillery and mortars joined the cacophony of gunfire Friday in Abidjan, the nation's commercial center and largest city, witnesses said. French and United Nations troops beefed up their presence on the streets to fill a security vacuum. ""The situation on the streets has deteriorated to such an extent that it's just become too dangerous to go outside,"" said Henry Gray, a field coordinator with the humanitarian medical group Doctors Without Borders, who called his organization while in lockdown. ""There's a lot of pillaging and looting going on, and if you're out on the streets, you're basically a target."" And the violence isn't isolated to Abidjan. At least 800 people were killed Tuesday in the fight for control of Ivory Coast's western city of Duekoue, the International Committee of the Red Cross said Friday. The whereabouts of Gbagbo, who refused to cede power after a disputed November election, were not known. The French ambassador to Ivory Coast said on France Info radio that Gbagbo's residence was empty. U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said the U.N. mission in Ivory Coast has been in contact with both Ouattara and Gbagbo in an effort to ensure a peaceful resolution. ""I cannot confirm anything about any exit of Laurent Gbagbo,"" Haq said. Gbagbo adviser Abdon Bayeto blamed the United Nations and global leaders including France and the United States for Ivory Coast's bloodshed by recognizing Ouattara as the legitimate president. Ouattara knows he lost the election, Bayeto said, adding that Gbagbo is a true democrat. ""For 30 years there was no trouble in the country,"" he said. ""We are going to be victorious."" The chances for that victory appeared slim Friday after pro-Ouattara forces launched a massive offensive in a final push to oust Gbagbo. Gbagbo had been expected to appear on state-run television, but the embattled president has not been seen in public for days and the TV network -- accused of having incited post-election violence -- went dark Friday after pro-Ouattara forces attacked the building and took control. Ouattara, the internationally recognized president, had been confined to a United Nations-protected hotel in Abidjan. Gbagbo's siege of the hotel ended Thursday after pro-Ouattara forces carried a nationwide offensive to Abidjan. Ouattara declared evening-into-morning curfews for Friday and Saturday in Abidjan. Ouattara's interior minister also announced on radio that the air and sea borders of the country would be sealed until further notice. It will be only ""hours, maybe days"" before Gbagbo falls, predicted Ouattara's spokesman, Patrich Achi. ""The army does not want to fight for Laurent Gbagbo."" The African Union called again Friday for Gbagbo ""to immediately hand over power."" ""Gbagbo's days are numbered because he overstayed his welcome,"" Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga told CNN. Odinga has served as the African Union's main negotiator in Ivory Coast. ""The will of the Ivorian people must finally prevail."" Events in Ivory Coast are sure to have critical implications for the immediate region and all of Africa. The nation had been on the rebound from a 2002 civil war and the elections last year inspired expectations that the cocoa-producing nation would embark on a new chapter that would take it closer to becoming a stable democracy. But the post-election chaos does not bode well for other African nations struggling to become stronger democracies. And thousands of people have crossed into neighboring nations including Liberia, which is trying to hold onto its own fragile peace. An Abidjan resident told CNN that most of the city's 4 million residents were huddled inside their homes Friday with no access to information since national broadcasting was off the air. The resident was not identified because of security reasons. ""Armed gangs are out on the street and there is a real atmosphere of fear out in the community, particularly in the poorer areas,"" Gray said. ""It's weird, because Abidjan is actually a really nice city with well-maintained roads and nice bridges and big buildings."" Documentary filmmaker Seyi Rhodes said Abidjan, a city that never slept before the turmoil erupted, was empty and bleak. International journalists covering the conflict did not dare venture out from their hotel Friday. Abidjan has become a city divided where it is difficult to decipher loyalty, Rhodes said. ""There is nothing now,"" said Rhodes, who had visited the city before the conflict. ""Abidjan is a shadow of its former self."" The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported an exodus of more people Thursday. ""Heavy fighting, widespread human rights abuses and fear of war have already forced up to 1 million people to flee their homes in Abidjan,"" the report said. Some 500 foreigners, including 150 French citizens, sought refuge Thursday at a French military camp, said a spokeswoman for the French Defense Ministry. A Swedish employee of the United Nations was killed in Thursday's fighting in Abidjan, said Joakim Larsson, a spokesman at the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""She was in her home when she was hit by a bullet which killed her,"" Larsson said. Before Friday's revelation of the 800 or so deaths in Duekoue, human rights monitors had documented the deaths of 462 people -- some in heinous fashion -- and warned Abidjan is on the brink of catastrophe. ""The international community must take immediate steps to protect the civilian population,"" said Salvatore Sagues, Amnesty International's researcher on West Africa. Republican Forces wrested control of much of Yamoussoukro and other key cocoa-producing and port cities earlier in the week before marching to Abidjan, the commercial center of Ivory Coast. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights reported Friday that the agency had received ""unconfirmed but worrying reports"" that Republican Forces have been committing human rights violations in their advance to Abidjan, especially in the Guiglo and Daloa areas in western Ivory Coast. Among the complaints were arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment of civilians. Similar abuse accusations have been leveled at Gbagbo's men in Abidjan, the agency said. Concerned about the rising tide of violence, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Wednesday to impose sanctions on Gbagbo, his wife and three associates, as well as give U.N. peacekeepers more authority to protect civilians. The U.N. resolution demands that Gbagbo step down immediately and that all state institutions, including the military, accept Ouattara as president. It also authorizes U.N. peacekeepers ""to use all necessary means to carry out its mandate to protect civilians under imminent threat of violence."" CNN's Zain Verjee, Carey Bodenheimer, Christabelle Fombu and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","NEW: At least 800 people were killed Tuesday in the Ivory Coast, the Red Cross says .

ff47bff651572300fec9dc42a41ae9046e98d1ee,"Washington (CNN) -- Using firsthand accounts of coping with the threat of radioactive contamination, several Japanese citizens who lived near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant hope to convince U.S. officials that nuclear energy poses an unacceptable risk. Three operating reactors at the Fukushima facility suffered meltdowns in March from a combination of earthquake, tsunami and equipment failure that led to radiation leakage and widespread contamination. ""I come from Fukushima,"" said Sachiko Sato, a farmer, who traveled with two of her children to Washington. ""Radiation affects this absolutely unchanged scenery, but it's still very much there."" Her English wasn't perfect, but her fears came through clearly at a news conference Tuesday as she suggested that the Japanese government arbitrarily raised contamination standards to limit the payment of relocation money. Sato's farm is in an area that no longer qualifies for assistance under relaxed measurements. She asked rhetorically, ""Did they think the ability of people to sustain radiation became better after the accident?"" Two of her children, both teenagers, told of being frightened that they were exposed to radiation that could cause health problems in years to come. Yukiko Anzai, an organic farmer whose bees produce honey as an agricultural commodity, said she and her husband may have to abandon farming because they don't know how radiation will affect their bees. She told reporters, ""We have been farming for the happiness and health of the people, farming the way we did. Now we are really struggling. It is very difficult for us."" The two women are part of a group that includes activists who oppose Japan's reliance on nuclear energy and want to use the Fukushima disaster to curtail the use of atomic power. They met with U.S. congressional staff members Monday, and on Tuesday afternoon, they met with commissioners and staff members of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Japan is already at minimum reliance on atomic energy because of routine maintenance and scheduled shutdowns. Activists want to keep the plants closed. ""There are 11 still operating and 43 shut temporarily,"" said Aileen Mioko Smith of Japan's Green Action. ""They're gradually being turned off"" for maintenance, she explained, ""so unless they start up again, none will be operating by March 2012."" She acknowledged that Japan's government has every intention of restarting the nuclear plants. But Smith and the Japanese families potentially exposed to the fallout from Fukushima say they're encouraged by the German government's decision after Japan's accident to discontinue atomic power plants over the next decade. The United States and other Western countries continue to envision a role for nuclear energy with a review of safeguards. Japan's activists believe there is no safe path that includes nuclear energy. Kaori Izumi, who is fighting the restart of Japan's atomic power plants once they close for maintenance, told reporters, ""There is immense suffering in Fukushima, including Mrs. Sato and other families. The only way their suffering gets meaning is that we learn from this lesson."" Citing the well-known nuclear disasters of the past 30 years -- Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island, the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine and now Japan's Fukushima meltdown -- she said, ""Can we afford not to learn? I don't think so.""","Farm families near failed nuclear plant call for full moratoriam .

Google is at the centre of Silicon Valley gossip after striking up a . romance with the search engine’s married multi-billionaire founder. Only . last year, Amanda Rosenberg was so friendless after moving to San . Francisco that she spoke of eating her lunch alone in the toilets. But . the 27-year-old, who boarded at £31,000-a-year Marlborough College . with Princess Eugenie and Kate and Pippa Middleton, certainly seems to . have turned things around – for she was last night named as the new . lover of Sergey Brin, 40. Google has been rocked by talk of the . romance, and a spokesman yesterday confirmed that Brin – one of the . world’s richest men with a £15billion fortune – has for several months . been living apart from his wife of six years Anne Wojcicki, the mother . of his two children. If they divorce, Californian law suggests their . massive fortune would have to be halved – although they reportedly . signed a strict pre-nuptial agreement. While the internet was agog . with talk of Brin romancing his much younger employee, the Daily Mail . tracked down a distinctly unsurprised former boyfriend of Miss Rosenberg . – who said she ‘knew the power of her womanly ways’. Ewan Butler, . 28, a trainee teacher living with his parents in Darlington, said: . ‘Amanda’s a good looking girl, and she knows she is. 'And she’s good at . “playing” men – she played me.’ Brin’s relationship with Rosenberg . emerged only yesterday – but the pair were pictured together earlier . this year at a New York Fashion Week event, both wearing the . controversial Google Glass computerised spectacles for which she is . marketing manager. An employee of Google since she graduated with a . communications degree from Leeds University, she initially worked for . the internet giant in London before last year moving to San Francisco to . work at its Silicon Valley nerve centre. She soon won a role . promoting Google Glass, widely criticised as the glasses which enable . users to film and broadcast over the internet everything they see . non-stop, worrying privacy campaigners. Miss Rosenberg wrote an . online blog soon after she arrived – describing herself as a . ‘misanthropic Brit struggling to come to terms with Californian . optimism’. She wrote: ‘I’d been living a beautifully choreographed . life in London for pretty much my entire life; family, friends, job, . life. Then one day I realised the beauty had faded. ‘So I applied for a transfer with my company to a different country. Yes! The romance of a transfer! ‘Luckily for me this all worked out like I dreamed it would...NOT. Of course it didn’t work out like that! ‘I . remember having conversations with people about moving countries, and . no one talks about how it felt to be alone.

The website jibes: ‘Since Google Glass launched the company’s co-founder, Sergey Brin, hasn’t been spotted without a pair. 'He’s placed himself atop the privacy-eroding project, publicly, and inside Google’s secret labs. 'Maybe it’s because he’s f****** the Glass marketing manager, Amanda Rosenberg.’ The blog goes on: ‘Knowing that one of the most vital, powerful men at the company has been using Google’s most ambitious product as a dating pool won’t be smooth news for the rest of the team.’ She also wrote that she was initially so . shy she failed to turn up at her first work drinks invitation, fearing . she would be ‘the weird loner in the corner’, so stayed in eating . biscuits alone on her sofa instead. In an internet profile Miss . Rosenberg wrote of herself: ‘I’m part of the master race that is the . Chinese Jew or Chew, if you will. 'Born in Hong Kong but bred in the UK.

ff4882909caca91aadf859d47cff906d39f18901,"(CNN) -- Many skiers who visit Colorado prefer the slopes of Aspen, Vail or Breckenridge. But there's a cool little day trip from Denver that often gets overlooked by out-of-towners. The Ski Train begins its round-trip journey to Winter Park at Union Station in Denver, Colorado. The Ski Train is a 68-year-old local favorite that shuttles about 750 people between Denver and Winter Park. It runs on weekend days -- leaving Denver's Union Station at 7:15 a.m. -- and begins the return leg nine hours later. The 56-mile trip takes about two hours each way, and many riders say it's worth the cost to avoid the traffic hassles of the oft-congested I-70. A roundtrip ticket costs between $49 and $85. There are additional expenses, such as parking at the train station in Denver and lift tickets for skiers. If someone chooses to shop instead of ski, a free shuttle into Winter Park is available. Train riders love the trip route, which winds through the Rockies and climbs to 9,000 feet. It also travels through almost 30 tunnels, including the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel, which passes underneath the Continental Divide. ""The train ride up there is spectacular. You see wonderful vistas as you leave Denver through the northern plains and into the mountains,"" Kristal Kraft, a real estate agent in Denver, says. ""And once you get through the Moffat Tunnel, you're right there at Winter Park."" Kraft says she enjoyed her maiden voyage on the train, which came courtesy of a local home builder that bought group tickets in one of the club cars. ""I loved the convenience [of the train],' she says. ""We relaxed, talked, socialized. And when you get off the train, you are right there at the slopes."" According to skitrain.com, three additional cars are available for charter and one for company retreats. The Web site lists the price for the presentation car at $5,000 for a winter trip. The site says the current train cars were purchased after Ansco Investment Company bought the Ski Train in 1988. Kraft says the cars are comfortably heated and there is ample room to move around. Kraft, an amateur photography buff, enjoyed switching from window to window, side to side, to take pictures. There is one occasional hitch to riding the train. It shares the track with the Union Pacific Railroad and at times has to stop or pullover to make way for a freight train or Amtrak. And there are instances where another train has an accident. One time a coal train derailed in a tunnel and the Union Pacific officials told the Ski Train operators it would take two days to clear the tracks, says Ski Train media relations director Jim Bain. They called the passengers together in a cafeteria in Winter Park and advised them to call friends and family to come pick them up. The company also arranged for a few buses to come gather the remaining passengers and Bain says they were all headed back to Denver by 8:30 p.m. It was a worst-case scenario, he says, and it only happened once. There are occasional delays of a few hours. The bad news is you're delayed; the good news is you're on a full service train with food service and restrooms. And there's the ability to find a beverage. One reviewer on the Web site yelp.com said there's another bonus to the train. ""What's great is that once you get back into Denver you can hit Wynkoop brewery or any other bars around there to keep the party rolling,"" Ramon G. wrote.","Ski Train from Denver to Winter Park has been a local favorite for 68 years .

ff488e84e995d85a182f064b2e57eacedea6ddb9,"The romance of  journeying to your destination is clearly alive and well as these entries to a photographic competition entitled On The Road show. The images from 400 submitted from all over the world were the  winners of a competition run by the Society of International Travel and Tourism Photographers. And it was a civil engineer from Bristol who walked away with the top prize with his black and white shot of a car in the Eurotunnel. Jonathan Millard, 37, said: 'My photo was taken en route to a skiing holiday this year to the French Alps with friends and our 10-month-old daughter...my first ride in the Eurotunnel. 'I thought putting the camera on the ground with a fairly wide angle would make for an interesting perspective. It was the first of many holiday photos.' American Jim Shepka, from Windham, New Hampshire, came second with his moody black and white shot of Cape Neddick Lighthouse in York, Maine, while third place was taken by another Brit, Chris Upton, who picked out an iconic yellow taxi from the walkway of Brooklyn Bridge in New York. Chris, a travel and landscape photographer from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, said: 'I enjoy photographing throughout the UK but have also been fortunate to have visited some inspirational locations around the world. 'The opportunity to visit these magical places, meet the people and observe their culture, traditions and landscape has been a wonderful experience. 'My goal is always to capture the spirit of this in my images and to create an emotion in the viewer to learn more or indeed visit these locations themselves'. First prize: 'I thought putting the camera on the ground with a fairly wide angle would make for an interesting perspective,' said British photographer Jonathan Millard. Competition judge Phil Jones said, 'The very high standard made judging very difficult, but this  image caught the judges' eye with its leading lines, and the low camera angle gave greater feeling of connectivity to the 'road' which fitted nicely with the theme of the competition.' Second prize: Jim Shepka was second placed for his moody shot of Cape Neddick Lighthouse in York, Maine, which was built in 1874 . Runners up: 'I took this photo (left) whilst on my journey through Orissa, India in which I visited many tribal villages,' said Polish born Irena Sowinska. 'I encountered  children with a spontaneity and joyfulness that was very moving.' Right, third placed Chris Upton was also highly commended fort his image of a bike propped up against a coffee shop covered in number plates in Crested Butte, Colorado. 'I just happened to come across this bike while heading over to buy a cup of coffee,' he said. Third place went to another Brit, Chris Upton, of an iconic yellow taxi on Brooklyn Bridge, New York. Chris, from Southwell, Nottinghamshire, said: 'The shutter speed was quite tricky as I wanted to get the right amount of motion in the cars but  avoid camera shake. It was then a question of waiting until a yellow cab came by...' Highly recommended for this dramatic and colourful shot, Chris Upton's photograph of a lighthouse in Maine, the Pemaquid lighthouse also was picked out by the judges. 'It was taken at dawn and I composed the image using the rocks and the dawn sky to lead to the focal point of the image, the lighthouse,' said Chris of his amazing image . Commended: Californian Todd Arbini's 'Rolling green hills of Livermore.' The professional photographer said of this ethereal shot, 'I went for a drive on Morgan Territory Road which goes up the south west side of Mount Diablo [in California]. This view is looking back on the Livermore hills at dusk.' Almost Turneresque: The quality of the light is striking in this photograph by Todd Arbini which was also commended. Both pictures were taken on travels round his home state of California, this one of a road disappearing off into the sunset at Brentwood. Commended: Former Lancashire Evening Post photographer Georgina Brewster was also highly commended for her picture of the Houses of Parliament from the banks of the Thames. The 35 year old from Skipton in the Yorkshire Dales, who now concentrates on weddings and lifestyle photographs, took her picture from the South Bank on a weekend break in London with her husband and seven year old daughter. Commended:  Manuel Ramos from Santiago, Chile was highly commended for his 'on the road' shot going into a national park. The 37 year old architect said: 'This was taken on the road heading to Torres del Paine National Park, located in the Chilean Patagonia, Magallanes Province.' Commended: Tamal Mitra, 25, from Kolkata, India got this evocative sunset shot from his home town. The Android game programmer said: 'Prinsep Ghat is a Ghat built during the British Raj, along the river bank of Hooghly and on its bank on Kolkata side. I was taking photographs there with my friends when I saw a couple who had hired a boat for a ride.

Solana said the operation is ""very important"" because EU vessels will be operating ""in a place in the world that everybody's looking at because of the new problems related to piracy."" ""It's very important that we have taken that decision to launch it tomorrow,"" he added. The EU naval force will take over the role of escorting United Nations World Food Program vessels carrying food and relief supplies to war-torn Somalia, an EU news release said. Its mandate, which is spelled out in several U.N. Security Council resolutions, also will include ""the protection of vulnerable vessels cruising off the Somali coast, and the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast,"" the news release stated. The deployment follows a decision by the European Council in September that established a coordination cell that supported surveillance and protection operations by several member states off the Somali coast. Piracy has become increasingly common in that area this year, particularly in the Gulf of Aden. So far, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau. Those hijacked vessels include an enormous oil tanker, a chemical tanker, and a ship laden with Soviet-era arms, including tanks. The pirates normally hold the ships for ransom. The Somali-based pirates have extended their reach beyond Somalia's coastline. On Saturday, a Dutch-operated container ship outran pirates off the coast of Tanzania, an IMB official told CNN. A luxury cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew successfully outran pirates off the coast of Yemen last weekend. A multinational fleet -- including vessels from the United States, NATO member states, Russia and India -- has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year. In a recent interview provided to CNN, a pirate leader claimed attacks on shipping would continue so long as life in Somalia remained desperate. ""The pirates are living between life and death,"" said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. ""Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything.""","EU force will take over the role of escorting U.N. World Food Program vessels .

Alex Salmond today tried to laugh off complaints about his decision to unfurl a Scottish Saltire in Centre Court, insisting Wimbledon rules were there to be broken. The Scottish First Minister was accused of staging a political stunt by smuggling the flag in his wife's handbag before waving around behind David Cameron's head as Andy Murray secured his historic win. He insisted no-one sticks to the rule banning large flags around Centre Court, and after waiting 117 years for a Scot to win the men's singles 'a few Saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all'. PR stunt? Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond waving a giant Scottish flag, breaking Wimbledon spectator rules . What have you got there? The First Minister looks set to unfurl his giant Saltire as David Cameron glances behind to see what's going on . The stunt was seen as particularly controversial coming less than 18 months before Scotland votes on leaving the rest of the United Kingdom. Some will hope that Mr Salmond's push for independence will be bolstered by Murray's victory over Novak Djokovic in straight sets last night. But his decision to wave the blue and white Scottish flag around was not seen as being particularly statesmanlike, hiding a flag in the handbag of his wife Moira. The moment the nation was gripped by Andy Murray's historic Wimbledon victory, the First Minister of Scotland was rummaging in his wife's handbag. Alex Salmond knew a Scot triumphing in the greatest tennis contest on earth presented him with a PR coup and he was going to take it. Even better was the chance to dangle the Saltire behind David Cameron's head. But the row that has erupted is about more than whether it was statesmanlike behaviour. On 18 September 2014 Scotland will stage a referendum on leaving the United Kingdom after 300 years, and Mr Salmond is desperate to prove an independent Scotland can compete on the world stage. He will hope that Murray's victory will bolster his chances of reversing dire opinion polls which suggest his dream of independence will be defeated. Murray has refused to be drawn on it, insisting he wants to 'read more about the issue'. The vast Saltire also appeared to far exceed All England Club rules which forbid flags more than 2ft by 2ft. The regulations also ban objects or . clothing bearing political statements or commercial identification . intended for ‘ambush marketing’. But Mr Salmond claimed no-one stuck to the rules. 'I think a rule more observed in its breaking than its observation. 'But can I just point out, the All . England Club didn’t mind in the slightest, they’re really nice people, . and if the All England Club didn’t mind, I really don’t think anybody . else should either.' He also argued he should be given some leeway, with Murray the first Scot to win Wimbledon for 117 years. Mr Salmond told BBC Radio 4's Today . programme: 'You’ve just been saying about it’s the first triumph since . Fred Perry in 77 years. 'It’s the first Scot since Harold . Mahony in 1896 – it’s not something that happens very often, so I think a . few saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all. 'This was after the match was . finished, incidentally. This was part of the celebration. 'And the answer . is no, I am not responsible for the seating arrangements in the royal . box. 'I had the flag last year, actually – I just didn’t get the chance . to wave it last year.' However the incident provoked a flurry of . comment on Twitter, where it was described as an instance of . ‘photo-bombing’ – when someone spoils a photo by sneaking into the . frame, usually to poke fun at somebody. Mr Salmond insisted he had not planned to target Mr Cameron, adding: 'I had no idea what the seating arrangements were - that is absolutely the case.' But Education Secretary Michael Gove suggested it was inappropriate behaviour for Wimbledon's Royal Box. He told LBC 97.3: 'I think there is a difference between how you might behave in the Royal Box in Wimbledon and how you might behave in Hampden if a Scottish football team were to win. 'I think it was a wee bit of a stunt... my advice to Alex would just be ""Put it away dear"".' 'Bit sad': Alex Salmond's flag-waving antics attracted some criticism on Twitter from fellow politicians including the former deputy prime minister John Prescott . Murray poses with the Union Flag during the medal ceremony for his gold medal at the London 2012 Olympic Games . It is 77 years since a British man - Fred Perry - won a Wimbledon singles title. But it is 117 years since a Sctosman, Harold Mahony, triumphed - giving Alex Salmond the chance to whip out his Saltire. Mahony was born in Edinburgh in 1867 but spent most of his life in Ireland. At his Wimbledon debut in 1890 he crashed out in the first round, reaching the semis in 1891 and 1892. He took time out to train in America before returning to defeat Englishman Wilfred Baddeley in the final, 6–2, 6–8, 5–7, 8–6, 6–3. He went on to win a silver medal in the men's singles at the 1900 Paris Olympics. Former deputy prime minister John Prescott wrote on Twitter: ‘Alex Salmond photo-bombing David Cameron. Bit sad wasn’t it?’ BBC reporter Jon Sopel joked: ‘Alex Salmond waves a Saltire from Royal Box. Is there a referendum coming?’ Journalist Matthew d’Ancona posted: ‘Alex Salmond is usually a consummate politician. 'But today he was a grade-one wally.’ Comedian Brian ‘Limmy’ Limond wrote: ‘I’m pro-independence, but put the flag away Salmond - f****** grow up.’ He added: ‘Imagine Cameron scrambling for the Union Flag. Clumsy.’ Songwriter Roddy Hart asked on Twitter: ‘No matter how genuine or heartfelt, surely Salmond reaching for the Saltire whilst cameras watching would be seen as opportunistic?’ Mark Ferguson, editor of Labour website LabourList wrote: ‘Anyone spot Alex Salmond waving the Saltire behind Cameron’s head? Obvious what he was trying to do. You’ve got no class Salmond, no class.’ Labour peer George Foulkes said there is a ‘time and place’ for such a stunt. But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon leapt to the defence of her boss. ‘Hey folks, waving the Saltire isn’t political,’ she wrote on her Twitter account. ‘It’s showing enormous pride that a boy from Dunblane just won Wimbledon.’ Mr Salmond later hailed Murray as the . 'King of Scotland' whose victory over Novak Djokavic in straight sets . may be the 'pinnacle of Scottish sporting triumph'. Speaking . on Good Morning Scotland, Mr Salmond said: 'It's right up there, it's . up there with Chris Hoy, or Celtic and the European Cup. 'It's . an amazing victory. Paul Lawrie, Sandy Lyle in the Open. It's probably . the pinnacle. He says it's the pinnacle of tennis, this might be the . pinnacle of Scottish sporting triumph. 'It's an absolutely astonishing triumph.' Mr Salmond also revealed he is planning further celebrations in Scotland to capitalise on Murray's extraordinary victory. When asked what plans there were to . honour the sportsman, Mr Salmond added: 'He's already got the freedom of . Stirling. 'I was thinking of a reception in Stirling Castle, which has . got a nice sort of home town ring to it with Dunblane, something like . that. 'But Andy is king of Scotland, he can have anything he likes.' Criticism: Former deputy prime minister Lord Prescott was one of the first to ridicule Mr Salmond's flag stunt . Gaffe: Broadcaster Iain Dale thought it was funny that the TV cameras did not linger on the Saltire . Twitter user David Birch suggested an Englishman staged a similar stunt . Dark side: Political scientist Philip Cowley posted this joke on Twitter . Greeting: The two men appeared to exchange friendly words as they took their seats in the royal box to watch Murray take on Djokovic . Concentration: Mr Salmond and Mr Cameron watched from the royal box as the two finalists battled it out in sweltering heat on Centre Court . Should Andy Murray be given a knighthood for winning Wimbledon? Mr Salmond’s spokesman earlier defended . the decision to take a large Saltire into Centre Court said: ‘Scotland . feels enormous pride that a young man from Dunblane has won Wimbledon. 'With flags of all kinds flying around . Wimbledon and even a Saltire above Downing St, one extra Saltire among a . sea of flags seems like a fair way to celebrate.’ The All England Club declined to comment on the incident. Murray was criticised after joking . before the 2006 World Cup that he would be supporting anyone other than . England in the competition. He has not indicated which way he . will vote in next year’s referendum on Scottish independence, but he . warned his countrymen not to let their heart rule their head. In an interview with Scotland on . Sunday earlier this year, he said: ‘I want to read more about the issue. 'I don’t think you should judge the thing on emotion, but on what is . best economically for Scotland.’ Alex Salmond took to Twitter to express his delight over Murray's phenomenal win .","Scottish First Minister smuggled flag into Centre Court in wife's handbag .

For the 83-year-old has 50 varieties growing on a single tree. Mr Collett grafted buds from a range of apple plants on to an established specimen to produce the amazing tree. Scroll down for video . He has a total of 130 types of apple in a half-acre garden in Tangmere, West Sussex, that he has spent the past 30 years cultivating, including some of the rarest and most historic English varieties. He grows 30 other types of fruit including pears, plums, cherries, quince and pomegranate. Mr Collett, whose produce has won awards, is a member of the Royal Horticultural Society Fruit Group Committee and judges RHS competitions. One of the rarest apples in his orchard is Ashmead’s Kernel, first grown in Gloucestershire in the 1700s. Other varieties never seen on supermarket shelves including Howgate Wonder, Red Devil, Laxton’s Epicure, Spartan and Crawley Beauty. Among the smallest he grows is Api Noir, which dates back to Roman times. The retired headmaster first developed a love for apples during the Second World War when he spent his summer holidays picking fruit near his childhood home in Norfolk. ‘We were given extra-long holidays so that we could help bring in the fruit harvest,’ he said.

Benjamin Benit's remains were found wrapped up in a sheet in a bush . A RAF war hero lay dead and forgotten in his council flat for nine years before his body was thrown under a bush, an inquest heard. An unknown fraudster had been collecting Benjamin Benit's pension since he died and even after the body was dumped, Southwark Coroner's Court heard. When Benjamin Benit's remains were . eventually found wrapped up in a sheet in undergrowth he was still . wearing an England replica shirt from the 2002 World Cup and his left . hand was missing - it was later found in his old home. Detectives later arrested a man who initially gave his name as Benjamin Benit, but later said he was called Sidney Jackson,  but he was released without charge. Police are still in the dark as to who was claiming the dead man's pension and who callously chucked the war hero's body beneath a bush. A dog walker made the grisly discovery of Mr Benit's decomposed body in Lovelinch Close, Peckham, south London on August 10, last year. The inquest heard the body had only recently been moved from Mr Benit's flat. Sawdust from a nearby tree being cut was underneath the bag containing Mr Benit, showing he had been left there after August 5. The left hand was discovered by council officers when Mr Benit's home in Ilderton Road, Peckham was cleared out by council officers on August 23. Mr Benit was born in south London on 6 June 1925, and served in the RAF during World War II. He lived for a time in Bradford, where he had family, before returning to south London in the 1980s. Sad end: The body was found ditched beneath a shrub in Lovelinch Close, Peckham . Mr Benit was a regular customer in pubs around Old Kent Road and New Cross Road in south east London. He had missed a routine GP appointment in April 2002 and would have been 76 at the time of his death. 'From . all the available evidence, it follows that Benjamin Benit came by his . death in an unknown way in the year 2002,' said coroner Tony Badenoch. 'The police identified that the pension of Mr Benit had been accessed in the years since 2002. 'I note from the inquiries that pension cheques were cashed on August 15 and August 22. 'It is plain from all the material that it wasn't Benjamin Benit cashing his own pension but somebody else.' Gruesome: The coroner's court, pictured, heard about the grim end to Mr Benit's life . Detectives arrested pensioner Sidney Jackson and questioned him about the discovery of the body. Mr Badenoch said: 'He gave me some answers to some limited questions, and it was clear in his answers he told me he didn't know where Benjamin Benit had been living, and didn't know how he came to be in Lovelinch Close.' Mr Badenoch added: 'The body was severely decomposed and wrapped in a sheet, but still dressed.' 'Cleaners found what they later learned was a human left hand. 'The presence of the hand at Heversham House indicates that he had been at that address prior to August 5, 2011. 'The police then inquired how Mr Benit may have arrived in Lovelinch Close in a deceased and seriously decomposed state. 'It was blatantly obvious he had been placed there.' Mr Badenoch said he did not have enough information to conclude the specific cause of Mr Benit's death. They recorded an open verdict.","Body was discovered dumped under a bush in Peckham, south London .

ff494b50a3b9e8e921c781086abb6807aa3986f4,"Four people including a toddler were killed Tuesday and two more people were taken to hospitals after an early morning trailer home fire in southeast Ohio. Neighbors calling 911 reported hearing an explosion just after 4 a.m. Fairfield County Sheriff Dave Phalen said those reports were under investigation, and the cause of the fire was unknown. 'Oh my God! ... The trailer across the road just blew up,' reported the first caller, whose name wasn't included in an audio recording released by the sheriff's office. ' I'm going to say they're probably all there. Oh my Lord! Something just blew up over there. Holy crap!' The trailer fire was the third multiple-death home fire in Ohio in less than four weeks (library image) Phalen said authorities were searching for a possible seventh person who might have been inside the trailer home, which collapsed. No identities or information about the relationships of those inside were immediately available. 'It's completely gutted,' Phalen said. 'There are partial walls that are up, but the inside is completely gone.' He said a woman who appeared to be badly injured was taken to Ohio State University's medical center, some 40 miles northwest of the rural lot where the trailer stood, outside the village of Sugar Grove. A man was transported to nearby Fairfield Medical Center. The sheriff didn't have information on their conditions. Phalen said firefighters from seven departments responded, hindered on hilly two-lane roads by overnight snowfall. Fairfield County was under a Level 1 snow emergency, meaning motorists were urged to be very cautious because of hazardous conditions. The Ohio State Fire Marshal's office sent investigators to the site, which Phalen said was still smoldering several hours later. The trailer fire was the third multiple-death home fire in Ohio in less than four weeks. Three children were killed in a Dec. 12 house fire in Hamilton, in southwest Ohio, and a woman and three grandchildren were killed Dec. 26 in a fire near Washington Court House, about 40 miles southwest of Columbus.

ff497b90daccb0a2d0ea21a8e84d02706a475a65,"(CNN) -- The ""Linsanity"" surrounding the New York Knicks' surprise phenom at point guard may be motivated by something bigger than sports. Yes, Jeremy Lin is a terrific athlete, whose almost accidental discovery by the Knicks and little-engine-that-could perseverance make for great radio commentary and pop cultural mythology. But there's something deeper at play here: Lin is iconic of a new kind of hero for the 21st century. And he is not alone. Take Lin's story by itself: A Harvard graduate and only occasional Ivy League basketball star, Lin struggles to get recognized in the NBA. He is picked up by the Golden State Warriors only to be released. Then, plagued by player injuries and in need of an extra backup point guard, the Knicks pick up Lin as a temp backup, only to dump him back in the D-league when they think they don't need him. After a string of losses, they bring him back on board more for the hell of it than anything else, and Lin lights a fire under the team, leading it to a run of dramatic victories. Still, Lin is not a superstar in the modern NBA slam-dunk sense. He can drive to the basket and make clutch plays, but the key to Lin's success is his ability to make the rest of his team work -- well, like a team. The economics major is a cool intellectual, who looks at his colleagues as part of a system. His talent is being able to keep them and the ball moving, and to find the open man -- whoever it might be, even himself. This style of play evokes earlier eras of the sport, where teamwork mattered more than individual performance. Yet it also evokes the spirit of our current era -- one in which networks and connections are coming to matter more than individual skill or personal gain. Another view: Jeremy Lin's race is a factor . Consider another Harvard alum in the headlines these days, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. He came up with his social networking platform in his dorm room, with little more ambition than to create a new way for his college friends to connect to one another. And with a combination of perseverance and bit of luck, he ended up in the right place at the right time. Unlike the charismatic CEOs of the industrial age, Zuckerberg is a rather unassuming, quick-to-gaffe computer programmer whose entire premise -- his entire business -- is based on his ability to keep other people networking. At his best, he is a mere facilitator. Likewise, Harvard Law alum Barack Obama came out of nowhere. A state senator gets picked to keynote a Democratic convention, and then somehow flips his huge success at that into a winning presidential campaign. His rise to viability, remember, depended on the strength of his Internet fundraising, and his ability to organize new networks of people around his candidacy through tools like Meetup and Facebook. And again, it's a cool, plainspoken facilitator at the helm: so cool and deliberative that he infuriates even some of his allies, but a strategist whose deeper instincts about playing the political game are only now coming to light. These are not the kind of people we traditionally think of as heroes in sports, technology, and politics. Compare Jeremy Lin, Mark Zuckerberg, and Barack Obama to, say, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs, and Bill Clinton. Jordan, Jobs, and Clinton were stars in their own right. Their campaigns and their victories were about themselves. It was Jordan who made the dunks, Jobs who showed us the iPhone, and Clinton who made his presidency about himself. Lin, Zuckerberg, and Obama, on the other hand, are rather underwhelming as tribal leaders. They are leaders of the Net generation, who owe their power to the networks they can catalyze. That's why the extent to which these three succeed will be based on their ability to keep the story from being about themselves. Jeremy Lin's biggest problem right now is his superstardom, and the fact that fan focus and adulation could make it harder for him to keep his senior, star teammates from getting jealous and uncooperative. Or worse, they could convince Lin that he really is all that people wish for him to be. Likewise, Zuckerberg's greatest liability is the possibility that the people actually energizing Facebook -- those of us who use it to connect -- begin to suspect that his company and shareholders matter more than us. Once it feels like we're creating more value for him than he is for us, we're out. And finally, Obama's success -- and chances for a second term -- may depend on his ability both to keep the ball moving, and keep his adversaries from casting that dependence on teamwork as some form of European socialism. Remember, Obama did not tell us that he was the one we were waiting for, but rather that we are the ones we have been waiting for. This is 21st century leadership, writ large. Whether we, the president, the Internet or even our sports industry are up the challenge is the real question posed by the rise of a kid named Lin. Follow CNN Opinion on Twitter.

A son was denied a fair slice of his dead mother's £1m fortune after he stopped visiting her and neglected to send flowers on Mother's Day, the High Court has heard. Kenneth Hart is suing his sister, Susan Burbidge, 47, whom he claims controlled his 'vulnerable' mother Phyllis Hart's finances in the months before her death aged 86 in November 2008. He and his brother, Paul, 49, are now urging a High Court judge to overturn cash and property transfers worth around £450,000 executed by their mother in Susan's favour in the year before she died. Legal battle: Kenneth Hart (left) is suing his sister Susan Burbidge (right) over claims he was denied a fair slice of their late mother's £1m fortune because he stopped visiting her and didn't send flowers on Mother's Day . Kenneth, 67, described his mother as a 'good woman and housewife' but claimed she 'could not make up her mind about anything' - even when it came to choosing her own curtains. And she had no idea about financial matters, he told the court. Phyllis was widowed when his father, Ernest, died in 2005, Mr Hart told the court, inheriting the £1m-plus fortune Ernest had created through a thriving marquee business, Ernest Hart and Sons. By 2007, his mother was increasingly under his sister's influence, insisted Kenneth, claiming that 'any suggestion you made to mother would have to be passed by Susan'. Tension was already building within the family after Phyllis announced the previous year that she was transferring part of the company's business premises to Susan, the court heard. Kenneth, from Poole, Dorset, said this news left him 'annoyed' and conceded that he went for at least 12 months without visiting his mother, although he 'never stopped caring for her'. Family feud: Mr Hart his brother, Paul are urging the High Court (pictured) to overturn cash and property transfers worth around £450,000 executed by their mother in Susan's favour in the year before she died . His sister's barrister, Paul Emmerson, suggested that Kenneth had succeeded in 'alienating' his mother, who had become increasingly 'angry and bitter' at his apparent indifference. She had every right to 'seek sanctuary' with her daughter and son-in-law, said the barrister, as they were 'doing everything for her' and had taken her in. Mr Emmerson also cited complaints made by Phyllis about Kenneth's alleged neglect of his filial duties, including his failure to send her flowers on Mother's Day and sending a Christmas card 'which didn't even have the word mother on it'. She was 'entitled to feel upset and to distribute her property as she wanted', he added. Kenneth said he had always loved his mother but Mr Emmerson suggested he 'could have made her aware of how you felt about her'. 'You could have stayed in more regular . contact, and you could have written to her or sent her Christmas and . birthday cards?' the barrister put to him. Claims: Mr Hart's mother, Phyllis, allegedly complained about his apparent neglect of his filial duties, including his failure to send her flowers on Mother's Day . 'I think I did send her Christmas cards,' Kenneth replied, although accepting that he 'could have done more'. He had been working long hours and into weekends, he said, and had done his best to keep in touch when she moved house during her final year, also denying any terminal rift with his mother. Describing the family culture he told the court: 'We were never a close family and could go for weeks and weeks without seeing one another, but we were never at loggerheads'. The Hart brothers' barrister, Charles Auld, argued that Phyllis' transactions in her daughter's favour 'call for an explanation' and urged the judge to rule them invalid unless Susan can establish that her mother was acting of her own free will. But Mr Emmerson argued that Phyllis was 'not the vulnerable old lady' portrayed by her sons. She had 'come out of herself' since the death of her controlling husband, he told the court, and managed to weather a series of 'hectoring' exchanges with Paul, some of which he taped, said the barrister. 'She was strong and independent of thought, and perfectly capable of standing up to Paul Hart and being annoyed by his actions and the apparent indifference of Ken Hart,' he told the court. The brothers' lawyers say that, by the time of Phyllis' death, nearly everything her husband had left her - valued at over £1m - had been transferred to Susan Burbidge and her husband, Brian, subject to an 'unsigned loan agreement' that the couple would pay back £410,000 into her estate. Kenneth and Paul are asking Judge Sir William Blackburne to overturn a £290,000 cash transfer to Susan and her husband and the transfer of the proceeds of sale of the Hart family home in Beacon Park Road, Upton, Poole, to the couple. Phyllis had lived in that house throughout her marriage but moved into Little Manor Farm, in Poole, shortly before her death. The brothers' claim is being hotly contested by Susan and Brian Burbidge. The High Court hearing continues.","Kenneth Hart suing sister over claims she controlled mother's finances .

ff4ad35e8d257a7d47995e440d47c58a122ca8a9,"Adventurer Nick Hancock headed out into the Atlantic today  to begin his second bid to live for two months on Britain's loneliest outpost, Rockall. His last attempt to break the record for living alone on the tiny, remote rock in the Outer Hebrides ended before it even began at the end of May last year. Heavy seas stopped him leaving his boat and he was forced to make the 15-hour return trip to Leverburgh on nearby Harris. Not particularly inviting: Rockall in the North Atlantic is an isolated pinnacle which only four people have ever managed to sleep on . Ready: Nick Hancock left for Rockall today . But now the Chartered surveyor and former Officer Training Corps cadet is to try again by landing on the rock tomorrow, weather permitting. On Twitter Hancock announced: 'We're heading to #Rockall today!' before loading his equipment on to the chartered Kilda Cruises boat at Leverburgh on Harris in the Outer Hebrides. Hancock, 38, from Ratho near Edinburgh, is raising money for the charity Help for Heroes, and plans to make regular broadcasts for TV and social media from Rockall. Hancock has been practising load winching to ensure he gets his survival pod - created from an 8ft yellow water tank and powered by a small wind turbine and solar panels for charging his satellite communications - up on to Rockall. 'The only real physical side is the initial climb and hauling the pod and equipment up,' he says. The occupiable area of Rockall, named in 1955 as Hall's Ledge after the first recorded person to land there, is just 11ft by 4ft, and is 13ft below the summit. The 'rockpod' footprint will leave accessible only the flattish platform on the summit for Mr Hancock to scramble up to for exercise. Last year Hancock set off for Rockall, an eroded volcano, which lies 260 miles west of the Outer Hebrides with the intention of spending 60 days on the remote sea rock, which is just 100ft wide and 70ft high. He had taken all food and water with him and planned to live in a 23 stone shelter bolted to the rock in his bid to break the current 42-day record. But when he arrived, the swell around the rock made it impossible for him to safely scramble on.He also admitted his wife Pamela did not want him to go. The couple have a two-year-old son Freddie. Survival pod: Hancock's bright yellow pod, made from a 8ft water tank will be his home during his isolation . Greenpeace activists were the last to occupy Rockall in 1997 in protest at plans to expand oil exploration . Hancock, who in 2012 stayed for a short while on Rockall as part of a reconnaissance mission for last year's mission, had aimed to set two endurance records on the isolated islet and raise £10,000 for the Help for Heroes charity. Rockall is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of Atlantic swell. The world's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - some 19 feet higher than Rockall itself. Being in such an isolated location, only four people have ever slept there, and less than 100 have landed on it. The first record for time spent on Rockall was 40 days in 1985, when ex-SAS soldier Tom McClean lived on the rock from 26 May to 4 July to affirm Britain's claim to the islet, which has been disputed by Ireland, Iceland and Denmark. His record was broken in 1997 by three Greenpeace activists who stayed there for 42 days in protest at north Atlantic oil exploration.","Only four people have ever managed to spend a night on the rock, which is just 100ft wide and 70ft high .

Keith Millen oversaw a second away point in succession as caretaker manager — not to be sniffed at in their predicament. But, quite simply, Pardew must make Palace a greater attacking force. Brad Guzan was not called into meaningful action once. Pardew congratulated the players and Millen in the dressing room afterwards for their organisation, but told them sparkle is needed to survive.

No need for notebooks to record the details of this dire game. Aston Villa’s role cannot be discounted. They continued to pass the ball as instructed by Paul Lambert but moves broke down far too easily, far too frequently. Their goal tally stays stock still at 11 in 20 Premier League games, the lowest in England’s top four divisions. They have failed to score in 12 matches in all competitions this season. There were boos at half-time. Louder boos at the final whistle. In the first half, Alan Hutton was presented with an excellent chance to score his second of the season when Aly Cissokho’s cross fell kindly. But Julian Speroni spread himself large and blocked the shot brilliantly. Ron Vlaar was then forced from the field having injured his knee in a collision with Wilfried Zaha. He suffered a similar problem for Holland at the World Cup, Lambert said afterwards. Yannick Bolasie sprinted clear like a 100m runner, away from Jores Okore and across Ciaran Clark, but sent his shot smacking against the crossbar. Alas, that was to be as exciting as it got. The rest of the game an affair void of speed, creativity or flow. Palace had failed to score in four of their last five away games so another blank here was no shock.

ff4b92fd9f7bb31e3aa56b5fcef93248edb7f91d,"By . Lucy Thackray For Daily Mail Australia . AFL player, Adelaide Crows forward Tom Lynch has suffered a neck fracture, which was detected four days after he suffered the injury during last weekend's clash with Brisbane Lions. A statement from the Adelaide Crows confirms that 'after complaining of soreness and pain in his arm, Lynch was sent for an MRI scan (on Thursday). It revealed a fracture.' Initial X-Rays and a CT scan had not shown any fractures or serious injury. On Sunday August 10, Lynch was involved in what the Adelaide Crows are calling ‘a sickening collision’ in the second quarter of the match at The Gabba in Brisbane, Queensland. On game day, Lynch was stretchered off in a neck brace after making front-on contact with Brisbane defender Justin Clarke, but scans on the day indicated Lynch had escaped critical neck damage. Adelaide Crows forward Tom Lynch holds his head and grimaces shortly before being stretchered off after a collision during the game which left him with a neck fracture . Tom Lynch of the Adelaide Crows is stretchered from the field during the round 20 AFL match between the Brisbane Lions and the Adelaide Crows at The Gabba. 23-year-old suffered a neck fracture in the incident. Tom Lynch and Charlie Cameron of the Crows celebrate a goal during the round 20 match last weekend, before Lynch was involved in a 'sickening clash' in the second quarter. Four days later, Lynch discovered he has a small neck fracture which early scans did not show. Lynch was allowed to fly home with the team when cleared of any serious neck injury and the club had been referring to the injury as 'a jarred neck', until the discovery the injury was far worse. Lynch, 23, was experiencing soreness and pain in his arm, the club confirms in their statement. When the young player was not showing signs of recovery by Thursday and continued to experience ‘the occasional tingle in his fingertips’, doctors ordered further scans, concerned there was more to the neck injury, according to 3AW radio. Dr Peter Larkins told 3AW radio that Lynch has fractured C7 and T1 vertebrae in his spine and expects he will be in a neck brace for six weeks. The club confirms that Lynch will wear a neck brace, but for an unknown period of time. They emphasise that the brace is only a precautionary measure, to prevent further damage. Although initial x-rays and a CT scan did not show any serious damage, Tom Lynch discoverd four days later that he has suffered a neck fracture. Lynch is pictured injured and being stretchered off in the Adelaide Crows Round 20 match against the Brisbane Lions on August 10. Tom Lynch will wear a neck brace as a precautionary measure to avoid further injury. The Adelaide Crows forward has had terrible luck with injury this year, undergoing surgery for a broken jaw from a collision with Melbourne Demons' Jack Viney. Fellow Adelaide Crows player, Patrick Dangerfield says the players were worried when the incident occurred but relieved to see their teammate was able to move his arms and legs, according to Adelaide Crows media. Earlier this year, Lynch required surgery for a badly fractured jaw, suffered from a bump from Melbourne Demons midfielder Jack Viney. Lynch was also recovering during the pre-season from foot surgery, only to dislocated his shoulder on the eve of the new season, when he had been finally deemed fit to play. Coach Brenton Sanderson laments that the 23-year-old is having a 'horrific season injury-wise.' Sanderson also defends Lynch, saying that although Lynch has received criticism for ducking his head when he came into contact with Clarke’s torso, Lynch was possibly trying to protect his jaw, considering the forward had suffered his broken jaw earlier in the year in a similar altercation. Tom Lynch (right) was Adelaide's top goal scorer in 2013 and had already scored two goals against Brisbane Lions, before he was involved in the serious collision in the second quarter of the Round 20 match. ‘You have to remember  earlier in the year... he (Lynch) came out and lifted his head he got his jaw smashed in half. I think this time, instead of lifting his head up in the contest, Sanderson kept his head down,’ Sanderson told Adelaide Crows Football Club media. Adelaide’s 2013 leading goalkicker had already kicked two goals before he was stretchered off. Adelaide went on to secure a 105-point win over Brisbane. Lynch sat out last night’s narrow loss to Richmond. At this stage it is unknown how long Lynch will be out with injury.","Adelaide Crows forward Tom Lynch has suffered a small neck fracture .

Channel Seven have identified a man in a green polo shirt and a black cap as Mark Schneider, who along with his partner was pictured on the fence celebrating the race with a huge flag. Footage taken from the woman's phone, Channel Seven cameras and a camera mounted on the helmet of Araldo's jockey Dwayne Dunn capture the exact moment the horse spots the flag in the crowd and loses its composure - kicking a fence that shattered its leg. It comes as Racing Victoria confirmed that flags would be banned for the remainder of the Melbourne Cup carnival - and that horses would be led back to mountain yard via a different route away from the crowd. Scroll down for video . Mark Schneider, pictured in a green polo shirt and a black cap, says he deeply regretted the incident . Mr Schneider, with the assistance of another man, helps hold his partner up as she waves the large flag that spooked Araldo . Seven-year-old stallion Araldo (left) ridden by Dwayne Dunn is pictured tangled in the fence after being spooked by an Australian flag . Araldo, piloted by jockey Dwayne Dunn, is clearly distressed at the sight of the flag . Racegoers claim that Mr Schneider thought the incident was funny - but he said in a statement to Seven News that he was 'shattered' and 'deeply shaken' The man and his partner are then confronted moments later by angry punters in the crowd, who have accused the couple of finding it funny. 'A horse got hurt and you thought it was funny,' a racegoer says to Mr Schneider. 'You just put it up again.... the owners of Araldo have a million-dollar horse that's going to get the vet now saving its life because of you.' 'But you think it's funny. You laughed at security when he came up to you. Mr Schneider told Seven News in a statement: 'As owners ourselves we are shattered at the events of yesterday ... regretting what unfolded and are deeply shaken,' But a woman who witnessed the confrontation between Mr Schneider and the man in the crowd claims he wasn't initially bothered by Araldo's reaction. 'I don't think he really cared until he found out that the horse was injured.' Admire Rakti, the pre-race favourite, also died shortly after the prestigious race, with a preliminary autopsy pointing to to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm as the cause of death. VRC confirmed the rule changes to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday evening, citing the safety and wellbeing of horses, participants, employees and other event patrons as the key reasons. The ban on flags will be in place for the remaining two days of the spring racing carnival, but it has not been confirmed whether these measures will be implemented permanently. Julian Sullivan, VRC Acting Chief Executive, said the amendments had been implemented in direct response to Araldo sustaining a broken pastern when returning to the Mounting Yard on Tuesday. 'While it is important not to respond in a knee-jerk manner, these interim arrangements will be implemented until procedures are reviewed after the Melbourne Cup Carnival,' Mr Sullivan said. Horses will also be led along a different path after the race, a decision which was made in conjunction with Racing Victoria Chairman of Stewards Terry Bailey. 'Traditionally horses wait for the winner to lead them down the race, but will now enter the Mounting Yard in the order they return,' Mr Sullivan said. 'The larger crowds that gather for the Group 1 races will still have the opportunity to see the horses return to scale along the track.' Earlier on Wednesday pictures emerged showing Araldo, which ran seventh, clearly distressed at the site of a large flag being waved by a member of the public - who then shattered its leg after freaking out and kicking a fence on the way back to the mounting yard. Anthony Feroce, the racing manager of Araldo's stables, told the Herald Sun Melbourne Cup organisers should review crowd control measures after the freak incident, saying: 'It's not like car racing.' In mobile phone footage aired on Channel Seven, a man is seen angrily confronting Mr Schneider . Mr Schneider pictured here in the crowd says he is a regular racegoer and has previously waved the flag at the Melbourne Cup . The horse, which ran seventh, is clearly distressed at the site of a large flag being waved by a member of the crowd - and shattered its leg after freaking out and kicking a fence on the way back to the mounting yard . This shot taken from a camera mounted to the helmet of Araldo's jockey Dwayne Dunn shows the moment the horse spots the flag . The horse was later put down due to the injury suffered, during Melbourne Cup Day at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne on Tuesday . The death of Araldo and pre-race favour Admire Rakti overshadowed victory for the German-trained Protectionist, who romped away with the biggest winning margin in nearly two decades, and also reignited a bitter debate about the ethical treatment of racing horses. Dr Stewart said an autopsy was conducted for Admire Rakti on Tuesday night at the University of Melbourne and initial results point to acute heart failure and an irregular heart rhythm. A full post mortem with microscopic and toxicology studies will take 10 days or more, he said. 'It's seen in racehorses and human athletes as well - in the large mass of the muscle of the heart, the electrical current has to get through in a coordinated way, and at high heart rates sometimes that can become short circuited,' Dr Stewart said. Admire Rakti, the pre-race favourite, finished last in the Melbourne Cup and almost walked across the line . The heartbreaking moment that Melbourne Cup pre-race favourite Admire Rakti collapses and dies in the stall after the race . Racing Victoria head of veterinary services and equine welfare Dr Brian Stewart (left) and chairman of stewards Terry Bailey arrive at a press conferenceon Wednesday. Mr Bailey called Dr Stewart at 10pm the night before the Melbourne Cup to ask him to vet Admire Rakti . 'It happens more or less spontaneously with no warning.' He initially said the horse suffered from 'sudden death syndrome', which occurs in just 0.007 per cent of racehorses. The reason for Araldo’s demise was immediately clear. Speaking shortly afterwards, his trainer Mike Moroney said that the stallion had become distressed by a big flag and run off. 'They run the Melbourne Cup for 154 years and nothing like that has happened,' he said. Anthony Feroce, racing manager at Mike Moroney's Ballymore stables, said the horse's death was a 'freakish accident', but he anticipated the Victoria Racing Club would review how close punters are allowed to get to Cup horses following the race. 'I think the Victoria Racing Club does a magnificent job, but possibly they could look at flags that close to where the horses go,' Mr Feroce said. 'Someone had a big flag and was waving it and right at the time when our horse went passed it and they're animals, they get spooked quite easily.' Mr Feroce added that it was 'not fair' that racing was being portrayed as a cruel industry following the deaths of the two horses. 'All care is taken for their wellbeing and their welfare and I assure you, you've just got to talk to everybody involved and see how much love they have for the animals,' he said. 'Now and then we do have unfortunate accidents that happen but that's no different to any other sport.' The deaths of the two horses prompted an outpouring of comment online and reaction from animal charities who insist that racing is a cruel sport.

Considering Russell Slade is on the verge of making history at Leyton Orient, he is in a remarkably jovial and relaxed mood. Slade’s side face Rotherham in the League One play-off final on Sunday, when he will attempt to lead the club into the second tier of English football for the first time in 32 years. His four years and 49 days spent in charge of the little east London club have seen barely any money spent on transfers and make him the fourth-longest serving manager in the Football League. Keeping calm: Leyton Orient boss Russell Slade could help his side reach the Championship if they can beat Rotherham at Wembley in the play-off final . ‘Stop making me feel old!’ Slade jokes when this is put to him. ‘Am I proud? Yeah I’m proud that I’ve been at this football club for four years, I’m proud that I’ve been able to manage it for four years the way I wanted to do it. ‘We’ve missed out on the play-offs twice, we’ve finished seventh twice. ‘Now we hope this is our moment to get out of League One and give this club a little bit of a shot in the arm and have some fun in the Championship.’ There is something about Slade which is infectious. Even when the pressure is on and he is . just moments away from the biggest match of his life, in front of more . than 50,000 fans at Wembley, he keeps breaking out into a huge, genuine . smile. Barmy Brisbane: Orient fans celebrate with Dean Cox after his goal against Peterborough in the play-off semi-final . Crucial moment: Cox scores the goal which secured Orient's place in the League One play-off final . We’re looking out over Orient’s small Brisbane Road stadium, with room for only 9,271 fans but that number added to by the blocks of new-build flats which punctuate the four corners and overlook the smaller stands. It’s put to Slade that getting the club into the Championship will boost this tiny East End community and those flats will soar in value. He breaks out into an enormous chuckle when he says: ‘I’ve got one of them, why do you think I’m working so hard?’ Property gag: Slade stands in Brisbane Road and he joked that the flats behind him will boost in value if Orient can secure promotion . Promotion in sight: Romain Vincelot celebrates with Orient fans after the play-off semi-final win over Peterborough . It is another joke, he actually rents one from his chairman Barry Hearn. ‘I’m doing him another favour,’ he adds, still laughing. ‘I think it’s great for the community, I really do. ‘There was a pop-up pub during the 2012 Olympics, it’s called the Leyton Technical Pub now, it’s come to life a little bit in the years I’ve been here. ‘The Olympics was great for it and if the football club get into the Championship that’ll be great for it and the rest of the community too.’ Perhaps Slade’s down-to-Earth persona, his appreciation of how his work really impacts on others, comes from his unorthodox route in to football. Man at the top: Orient chairman Barry Hearn will hope his side can secure promotion to the Championship . As a player he was a defender, not tall enough at 16 but when he shot up at 18 he had the chance to play for Notts County. Slade, 53, instead choose to go to Edge Hill University to study a four-year degree in physical education. When he finished there he went to Nottingham where he got his first job at Frank Wheldon school, but six months in he was already taking time off to coach and play reserve matches for Notts County. ‘I took the under 15s for six months, then I was taking the under 16s, and that second year I was still teaching I was playing in the reserves,’ he explains.","Leyton Orient face Rotherham in Sunday's League One play-off final .

The messages between veteran broadcaster Kroft, 69, and Lisan Goines, 41, include pictures of the corporate lawyer posing in her underwear. The newsman also asks her a number of raunchy questions - including how many New Years resolutions she had broken. Ahead of a date at the Park Hyatt in the capital in September 2011, he told her dress 'in Washington is Either professional or Laura Bush' and insisted she did not look like Beyonce to avoid attracting attention. A source told the New York Post's Page Six Kroft was 'really paranoid about right-wing zealots' finding out about their three-year illicit affair and threatening his career at CBS. They also said: 'He was unwilling to be seen publicly with [Goines] because she’s black — because they’d be more noticeable.'

The paper  reported that Kroft boasted in the texts about his rapport with President Obama who he has interviewed on numerous occasions. Their source said: '[Kroft] definitely said Obama feels comfortable with him, because he was the first person to take him seriously when he was running for president,” the insider said. They have a rapport. They used to smoke together.' Kroft's representatives however have denied the allegations, saying they are 'filled with distortions, exaggerations and outright falsehoods.' In the string of messages Kroft says: 'Wanting to taste you again' before Goines replies by saying 'same here'. The next morning he the told her: 'Gonna explode if I can’t have you soon.' While staying in the same Washington Hotel they had a date in he messaged Goines saying: 'I’m in my room at the same Washington hotel where I remember having you for a four hour full course Meal plus desert.' Illicit: The texts between the pair included selfies of Goines while Kroft arranged to meet her at a hotel . Plans: The messages also include Kroft asking how many New Years resolutions she had broken and how the pair should celebrate Kroft's birthday . He also said: 'Very hard playing golf with A bulge in my pants.' Earlier this month, a week after the veteran correspondent admitted to a lengthy affair with Goines , a snap has emerged of the pair together. The pair, who are both married, met for drinks at the five-star Essex Hotel and were later seen kissing in the back of a cab, according to the National Enquirer. Kroft has admitted to the affair, calling it 'a serious lapse in personal judgment' after the magazine revealed that the duo had carried on a three-year relationship. 'My wife and I are committed to each other and are working hard to get past this,' he told the New York Post. 'Mistress': 41-year-old Goines, who is also married, met 69-year-old Kroft in a hotel bar in 2011 . The 60 Minutes correspondent, who is married with one son, and Goines hooked up in hotels across Manhattan and Washington, D.C. after meeting at a bar in 2011, it reported. Kroft had spotted Goines - who was then engaged to be married - from across the room in the St Regis and went to talk to her and her friend. While her friend was using the restroom, 'Steve quickly told Lisan, ""I have to see you again"",' a source said. A few weeks later, they arranged to meet for cocktails and afterwards, he handed her a room key so he could be alone with her, convincing her he was in a sexless marriage, the Enquirer reported. Throughout their affair, Kroft and Goines exchanged a series of racy text messages, including one in which he told her he 'would rather be eating your pudding' than be at work. 'Don't work too hard this week bc I wanna wear you out afterward,' Goines reportedly replied. Together: Kroft, pictured with his wife in May 2014, said they were working hard to get past the affair . In another message, he told her: 'Miss you and all that goes with it. Especially my favorite tastes and colors... pink and brown,' according to the publication. He also asked her what her 'preference' would be, and she reportedly responded:  'U all over and deep inside of me.' Sources also revealed the couple's bedroom habits, including his use of Viagra and how he poured champagne in her behind before drinking it. But while their affair began at the $700-a-night Four Seasons hotel, it quickly lost its luxurious edge and went 'kind of low end', a source said. She would often meet him while he was working in Washington D.C. and once asked him to buy her a ticket, and he agreed but only footed the bill that once, the report added. 'The whole thing soured because she got to the point where it was only about Steve,' a source said. They added that Goines never had any intention of leaving her husband and did not want Kroft to leave his wife, so ended it - until they were spotted out in Manhattan together on December 17. Questions: Kroft, pictured left in 1992 with Al Gore (center) and Bill Clinton (right) famously confronted Clinton about his womanizing during an interview during his election campaign in 1992 . The reports come more than two decades after Kroft confronted Bill Clinton over his womanizing when he was Arkansas governor. He has been married to Conant, 55, for 23 years. She is a journalist and author of four books about World War II, including three New York Times bestsellers, including 'A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS'. The couple lives in New York and they have one son, John. Kroft joined CBS in 1980 and has been with 60 Minutes for 26 years. His reporting has earned him three Peabody Awards and nine Emmy awards, including a lifetime achievement award. He told the New York Post that his 'personal failure' has no impact on his job as a journalist. Watch full interview on CBS .","CBS Newsman, 69, and corporate lawyer Lisan Goines had lengthy affair .

ff4d9305d0462afbe3a21535cf5feaab50346197,"(CNN) -- Whether they're raising their adopted baby girl, dodging homophobic quips from their fraternity brothers or teaching the ""Single Ladies"" dance to the football team after glee club, it seems gay characters are becoming a vital part of prime time TV. With characters like ""Modern Family's"" Mitchell and Cameron, Calvin from ""Greek"" and Kurt from ""Glee,"" the number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) characters on scripted programs has just about doubled since 2005, according to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance against Defamation. And characters will continue to identify as LGBT as time goes on, such as ""Ugly Betty's"" Justin, who recently had his first same-sex kiss. But Jarrett Barrios, president of GLAAD said, ""We still have a long way to go before we're fully represented [on] TV."" In addition to the increasing number LGBT characters on scripted shows, which currently represents a little more than 3 percent of all leading and supporting characters on broadcast networks, there are also more openly gay actors and producers working in Hollywood, says Barrios. Actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson plays the character Mitchell on the ABC prime time show ""Modern Family."" Like his on-screen role, Ferguson himself is openly gay. ""The opportunity to play not only a well developed gay character, but a dad, a son and brother was really appealing to me. ... I chose to play him very close to myself and I think that truthfulness was appealing to the creators,"" Ferguson told CNN. However, Ferguson says his sexual orientation does not make him any more qualified to tackle a gay role than Eric Stonestreet, his straight co-star who plays Mitchell's partner Cameron. ""As a gay man and as someone who is an advocate for equality, truthfulness and fairness, I want to see more gay roles go to gay actors,"" Ferguson said in an e-mail. ""But then on the flip side, as an actor, I want to still be given the opportunity to play roles that are straight."" In a recent interview on The Joy Behar Show , Stonestreet said he's excited he has been given the opportunity to portray one half of a committed gay couple raising a child -- a first, he said, for broadcast TV. ""Our goal is to make people laugh, but while we're making people laugh, if we can open a couple minds here and there, that's also an added benefit,"" he said. And while shows like ""Modern Family"" are working to open peoples' minds about same-sex parents, the ""L"" and the ""T,"" of LGBT, are still waiting for their TV time, said Hollywood casting director Tammara Billik. It's very common for female characters to be portrayed as bisexuals instead of lesbians, she said. ""I wouldn't say it's because of a discomfort with lesbianism, it's just an interest in bisexuality,"" Billik said. ""[People] think it's hot, and it gives characters a wide variety of storylines."" And as far as the ""T,"" she said, ""transgender people are not represented in our daily lives with the same frequency that gay and lesbian people are. It's harder to find an audience that will embrace a transgender character."" Sean Smith, the executive producer of ABC Family's ""Greek,"" said he has loaned some of his own experiences as an openly gay man to the show. And when casting, an actor's sexual orientation does not come into play. ""When you're in casting, it's not appropriate or legal to say, 'Hey, are you gay?' Whether they're gay, straight, from the South, British or from Mars, it doesn't matter. The best person who captures that character gets the job."" And for Smith, straight actor Paul James was the best person for the role of Calvin Owens, a gay member of Omega Chi, a fictional fraternity on ""Greek."" James said he doesn't think twice about the intimacy between him and the three actors he's made out with on the series. His girlfriend doesn't either. It's just acting, he says. But with the exception of Neil Patrick Harris, who came out in 2006, playing a straight character on ""How I Met Your Mother,"" straight actors are more often tapped for gay roles, rather than the other way around. Or so it seems. ""Many gay actors, who are not out in Hollywood, are afraid (coming out) will compromise their ability to get roles,"" Barrios said. ""But [LGBT] actors need to feel as if they can be who they are and still make it in Hollywood or homophobia wins."" Both Ferguson and Smith identified themselves as gay before beginning careers in Hollywood, but Smith said he understands why some people are apprehensive about coming out once they're in the spotlight. ""People want to succeed and avoid any potential pitfalls, and coming out is definitely one that can draw attention to you that might make other people in this town fearful of hiring you,"" said Smith. ""For me, I've never really questioned it. I've worked with great guys. For them it wasn't an issue, but I'm aware of other parts of this industry."" People want to watch characters they can relate to, said Smith, who was very excited to welcome ""Modern Family"" into his living room. ""Jesse and I ... get so many compliments from gay couples and lesbian couples that want to introduce us to their kids and thank us for representing them on TV for the first time,"" Stonestreet told Behar. But still, ""Modern Family"" isn't hitting viewers over the head with Cameron and Mitchell's physical intimacy. ""We're the perfect show to just build it in naturally, not draw a bunch of attention to it,"" Stonestreet said. For Ferguson, it's a non-issue. ""I want the viewers to know Mitchell and Cameron's sex and love life is just fine,"" Ferguson wrote. ""They also have regular bowel movements, but that is something you don't see either.""","The number of LGBT characters on scripted programs has doubled since 2005 .

ff4dde6b49ff8e1fcaafee202cc5c4ba9c900817,"A breakthrough in fertility science could lead to a huge boost in the success of IVF, scientists said today. IVF - or ‘in vitro fertilisation’ - is currently the only hope for many women to have a baby, and some 50,000 undergo the treatment every year in Britain. But despite its popularity, the procedure has a poor success rate, with 75 per cent of IVF rounds failing to produce a baby. Scroll down for video . Despite its popularity, IVF (pictured) has a poor success rate, with 75 per cent of rounds failing to work . Manchester University researchers now think they have found a way to slash the failure rate by half. They have discovered a ‘molecular switch’ which stops an embryo being accepted in the mother’s womb. If that switch can be blocked with drugs, it could potentially boost the number of babies born using IVF by up to 18,000 a year. About 37 per cent of IVF rounds are thought to fail because the embryo does not implant into the wall of the uterus. Women who repeatedly suffer this failure have been shown to have high levels of a molecular switch which interferes in the communication between the embryo and the mother’s womb. In laboratory tests, the researchers found that if they reduced levels of the molecule - called microRNA-145 - the embryo was less likely to be rejected. Study leader Professor John Aplin, whose work is published in the Journal of Cell Science, said: ‘When an embryo is ready for implantation, its replacement is carefully timed to coincide with the window of maximal receptivity in the uterus. ‘This window is open for no more than four days.’ Professor Aplin’s team found that a protein called IGF1R is required during the four-day window for the embryo to stick to the uterus. Their tests suggest that the microRNA-145 molecular switch stops the crucial protein from growing in that window. Scientists have discovered a ‘molecular switch’ which stops an embryo being accepted in the mother’s womb. If that switch can be blocked with drugs, it could potentially boost the number of babies born using IVF by up to 18,000 a year . Dr Karen Forbes, a reproductive scientists who worked on the project, said the breakthrough could change the lives of childless women - although the team is a long way from turning it into a successful treatment. Crucially, there are already chemicals on the market which have been shown to block microRNAs, and those could be developed to stop this molecular switch from interfering in the IVF process. ‘There are lots of ways in which we can inhibit microRNAs in the lab,’ she said. ‘Eventually drugs might be developed that could improve implantation rates.’ Professor Aplin added: ‘This is one of the hardest groups of women to treat in fertility science and rates are still very low across the board. ‘Repeated IVF cycles are stressful and can be expensive too. ‘Greater understanding of the mechanisms which control success or failure can lead directly to treatments to make IVF cycles more efficient so that infertile couples can start their families.’","IVF has a poor success rate, with 75% of rounds failing to produce a baby .

Omar Saeed Sheikh (pictured in 2002), who was convicted of the murder of reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002, has attempted to commit suicide in prison, police have said . A British man serving life imprisonment in Pakistan for the killing of American reporter Daniel Pearl has tried to commit suicide, police have said. Omar Saeed Sheikh was convicted in 2002 of the murder of Pearl, who was the South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal when he was kidnapped and beheaded in Pakistan. The 38-year-old reporter had been investigating militant groups when he was abducted in Karachi in January , 2002. On February 21, 2002, a shocking video of his killing was delivered to U.S. officials in Pakistan. His remains were found in a shallow grave on Karachi's outskirts three months later. British-Pakistani Sheikh, who attended Forest School in Snaresbrook, east London, and three others were arrested and convicted in June 2002. Sheikh has now tried to hang himself in prison, Senior police official Akram Naeem has told the AFP news agency. Mr Naeem said he was rescued after he was spotted by officials. He said: 'His condition is stable now and a case has been filed against him in the local police station.' In January 2011, a report by the Pearl Project at Georgetown University suggested the wrong men had been convicted of the murder. Daniel Pearl was abducted from Karachi while researching a story on militant groups - his body was found three months later . The investigation claimed the alleged mastermind behind 9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, was responsible for the murder. Days before he was abducted, Pearl had learned that his wife Mariane was expecting a baby boy. Mariane remained in Pakistan and campaigned for her husband's release throughout his capture. Daniel Pearl's death was confirmed on February 21, 2002. There were outpourings of grief from political and religious leaders, along with ordinary people around the world, who had campaigned for his release. Three months later, Mariane gave birth to the couple's son Adam. Marianne Pearl wrote a memoir entitled A Mighty Heart about her late husband's life which was adapted into a film starring Angelina Jolie as Mariane Pearl and Dan Futterman as the journalist.

Controversial: Emma Hadley, executive principal at the school, has defended the decision to use taxpayers' money to fund the trip . There was a time when a school trip involved an outing to a castle or a museum to mark the end of the academic year. But one school is spending £32,000 to . send 40 pupils and six teachers a little further afield next month – on . an all-expenses-paid trip to New York. Skegness Academy said the lucky . pupils were selected on the basis of attendance records, study records . and attitude – and an application letter outlining how the trip could . ‘support the subjects they are studying’. But the four-day, taxpayer-funded . ‘holiday’ was criticised by teaching unions and a local councillor . yesterday, who accused the Lincolnshire academy of using the expedition . to make the school more attractive to prospective pupils and their . parents. The academy defended the trip as an . opportunity to broaden the horizons of pupils who may otherwise be . unable to afford to visit the American city. Ian Stephenson, of the National Union . of Teachers, said the cost of the trip could pay the annual salary of . an extra teacher at the academy, rated ‘good’ by Ofsted. Lincolnshire councillor Mark Smith, . who is a governor at Skegness Grammar School, said: ‘The academy, by . giving holiday rewards and free uniforms, is trying to increase its . numbers at the expense of neighbouring schools, not just in Skegness but . the wider area.’ The lucky pupils, who will have their . flights and accommodation paid for, were specially selected after . submitting written applications to the school stating why they should be . given a place on next month’s trip. The . decision has been attacked by the National Union of Teachers who say . the money could have funded an extra teacher at the school. NUT regional secretary Ian Stephenson . said: 'It throws up issues about access to education and value for . money. 'This is a great opportunity for some children but it means other . children will miss out. The money being spent could easily fund another . teacher. 'Schools are now very competitive and I . can understand how schools would see these trips as a high profile event . which may attract pupils in a very competitive environment.

This represents a significant improvement on the results in 2011. 'All the students who left the sixth form in July 2012 have embarked on further training, education or employment.'

The influential Wigan loose forward, who was the logical choice to succeed Kevin Sinfield as captain of the national team, has failed to recover from a quad strain sustained in the Warriors' Grand-Final defeat by St Helens 10 days ago. Former St Helens skipper James Graham will lead the side out at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium for the first part of Saturday's double-header while Hull loose forward Joe Westerman will take over the number 13 jersey and win his first cap. Wigan loose forward Sean O'Loughlin will miss England's opening Four Nations Series clash with Samoa. 'Sean tried his best and our medical staff tried their best but the Samoa match has come too soon,' McNamara said. 'We thought it was right that we made an early decision but we remain confident he'll be ready for Australia the week after. 'It's a blow because he's our leader and obviously he's a really, really good player. 'But I'm really happy with his replacement. Joe had a great season for Hull FC, a team that didn't make the top eight, and to be a real stand-out for them shows what a quality player he is. England coach Steve McNamara is confident his team will cope without O'Loughlin . 'James will step in as captain for this week and he's a tremendous leader. We saw that with the (Canterbury) Bulldogs towards the back end of the season when he single-handedly more or less led them to the Grand Final. 'He leads by example and gives 100 per cent effort in everything he does. He inspires everyone around him to follow his lead.' Graham, who is set to skipper his club in 2015, took over the captaincy for England's 2010 Four Nations campaign in the southern hemisphere when Adrian Morley was forced to return home due to injury. McNamara has named two other debutants in his starting line-up - Wigan scrum-half Matty Smith and Hull KR hooker Josh Hodgson - while 2014 Man of Steel Daryl Clark is set to make his England bow from the bench. Former St Helens skipper James Graham will lead England against Samoa at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium . 'There is a slight evolution to the squad this year with some new faces on show,' McNamara said. 'The debutants are exciting and they can prove themselves on the international stage.' Hodgson, who will stay on in Australia at the end of the tour to take up a two-year contract with Canberra Raiders, has been given the number nine jersey but McNamara also expects the Warrington-bound Clark to make an impact. 'Daryl's (the) Man of Steel and has been the best player in the competition this season so there is no doubting his ability,' he said. 'Josh is a tough, tenacious player and I think for this game, his robust start will help us. I think Daryl's undoubted electric speed will also help us when he comes on when the sting goes out of the game.' S Tomkins (New Zealand Warriors); J Charnley (Wigan), K Watkins (Leeds), M Shenton (Castleford), R Hall (Leeds); G Widdop (St George Illawarra), M Smith (Wigan); G Burgess (South Sydney), J Hodgson (Hull KR), J Graham (Canterbury Bulldogs, capt), L Farrell (Wigan), J Tomkins (Wigan), J Westerman (Hull). Replacements: D Clark (Castleford), B Ferres (Huddersfield), T Burgess (South Sydney), C Hill (Warrington). The only surprise is the selection of Joel Tomkins, whose appearance in the Grand Final was only his seventh in rugby league since his return from a three-year stint in the 15-man code, ahead of Super League Dream Team second rower Elliott Whitehead. 'Joel is very experienced and a very good player,' McNamara said. 'He fought his way back into the Wigan team, played in a Grand Final and has been in this group before. He brings a whole lot of leadership and energy into the group. He's a tremendous player to have back with us.' It will be Tomkins' first appearance for three years alongside younger brother Sam, who is one of nine survivors from the team that lost 20-18 to New Zealand in their last match, their World Cup semi-final at Wembley 11 months ago. The Super League-based players have been in Australia for less than a week but McNamara is confident that by Saturday his side will be ready for what could be a tricky opening test. 'We've only had nine days to get ready but we knew that from the outset,' McNamara said. 'The thing with this group is that they are very intelligent players and you generally only have to tell them once or twice and they pick it up. 'We've got some great combinations going. Ideally you would like to test them out in a game situation before the tournament but I'm really confident.' Samoa will make their Four Nations debut under a cloud after three players - Reni Maitua, Tautau Moga and Sauaso Sue - were not considered for selection after it was revealed they are the subject of an NRL Integrity Unit review into an alleged nightclub brawl in Brisbane over the weekend. 'Come game day, they will be past all of that,' McNamara said. 'They will be ready for this game. I don't think it will affect them.'","Wigan loose forward Sean O'Loughlin failed to recover from a calf strain .

As our time in Sumatra drew to a close, I knew our biggest challenge still lay ahead.

It may be hard to recognize at first. However, we are connected to these faraway places and events in ways that firmly bind our futures together.

Ironically, due to burning and clearing of these vital forests Indonesia now accounts for over a third of the total global carbon emissions from deforestation and land degradations. Not surprising when you consider between 1985 and 2007, the island of Sumatra alone lost 12 million hectares of natural forest, a 48% loss in 22 years. Many see the impact of this imbalance and others like it in increasing extreme weather globally, rising sea levels, shifting wildlife habitats and crop patterns, tropical diseases moving into new areas, even regional political instability around the world. Watch now: Planting a million trees a year . Ground zero for the global fight against deforestation, Sumatra is the only place in the world where tigers, elephants, rhinos and orangutans co-exist. These native species are quickly disappearing as their habitat is lost to palm oil estates and pulp for paper plantations, as the plantations' roads give poachers ever better access to wildlife's last hiding places, and as some are poisoned by managers angry about elephants feeding in their plantations. Indigenous communities don't fare much better as they are being displaced together with their forests. Again, you may ask what's the connection? Biodiversity is the natural way that the earth manages its own sustainability. The more diverse the variety of species, the more healthy the ecosystem and the easier it can withstand spreading threats like disease or carbon-destroying fires. Once again fires have been burning in Sumatra this summer; June and August have seen some of the worst fires in years blanketing the island and neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. But NASA did not record fires in healthy forests. They remained standing, stopping the flames' onslaught, continuing to produce the oxygen we so desperately need. Read more: Restoring the ocean to health . The connection for many of us to this imperiled paradise is even more direct. From toilet tissue and plywood to lipstick, detergent and margarine, and even condoms, many ordinary household products are routinely produced using raw materials sourced from plantations that have replaced Sumatra's rainforests. The good news is that with such a direct connection, we have in in our power to create change with simple choices in the products we buy and use. Fortunately organizations like World Wildlife Fund (WWF) are fighting this global crisis. They recently launched a campaign to focus on one of the most pristine and threatened parts of Sumatra: Thirty Hills, a spectacular landscape I was fortunate to visit with WWF during my Sumatran odyssey. Find out more at www.Save30Hills.org and sign their change.org petition. It's one of the most important habitats of the critically endangered Sumatran tiger, along with orangutans, elephants and the indigenous Talang Mamak and Orang Rimba people. ...check it out. In my mind there are many reasons, some we encounter every day, why what happens in Sumatra should matter to each of us. When you watch ""Expedition: Sumatra"", I hope the beauty of this special place amazes you, I hope you are outraged by its destruction, but most of all, I hope you understand the power each of us has to change its future.","CNN Special Correspondent Philippe Cousteau explores Indonesia in ""Expedition: Sumatra""

A Chicago man has caught on video what could be the worst effect yet of the polar vortex: A burst pipe raining a storm of human waste through the ceiling of his advertising agency office. Kasey Moore, an advertising art director for Arc Worldwide, posted the stomach churning scene from the 15th floor of the Leo Burnett skyscraper Tuesday afternoon and the content is not suited for the faint of heart. It shows a sea of brown water filling up the office floor as more continues to gush down in a torrent onto the sprawling room’s desks and cubicles as horrified workers scramble to get out of the way. Scroll down for video... It's raining, it's pouring: As if the polar vortex couldn't get any worse, a burst pipe in a Chicago skyscraper caused a sewage storm to rain down on the Arc Worldwide ad agency . ‘So, this is happening on my floor at work,’ writes Moore on Instagram. ‘Poo eruption.’ It remained unclear from the video how widespread the leak was, but at over a million square feet, the 50-story tower can undoubtedly contain enough sewage to rain on a lot of employees’ parades. A spokesperson for the building officially denied that the brown liquid described by some as 'smelly' actually contained feces. 'While we appreciate the creativity, rest assured that it's only dust and water,' the spokesperson told Business Insider via e-mail. Moore’s appears to be the most vivid post yet of the ‘poo eruption,’ but some of his office mates have taken to social media to document the destruction as well. Instagram user bobbi12781 posted a . photo of a distraught man fleeing a cascade of human waste, but gave an . understated description of the putrid scene. ‘It's water from a busted pipe,’ she wrote. ‘Smelly water.’ Adrift in it: Kasey Moore of ad agency Arc Worldwide posted a video that makes all too clear the extent of the sewage leak on the 15th floor of the 50-story Leo Burnett building . Rain of terror: The sewage poured down the walls and from the ceiling in what Moore called a 'poo eruption' ‘What better way to start off the new year,’ complained jenibreni beside her own photo of the leak. While the exact cause of the leak remained unclear Tuesday evening, hospitals in Boston, Washington, DC, and Cleveland have all reported pipe bursts caused by the freezing Polar Vortex temperatures. These unfortunate Chicagoans have not only experienced a sewage storm this week, but they’ve also had to endure some of the worst winter chills the historic polar vortex has to offer. Temperatures in the Windy City hit -15 degrees Monday evening and hovered around 10 degrees at their highest on Tuesday. While the situation appears dire for the ad men and women of Arc Worldwide, commenter blipsman suggests on Moore’s video post that there could be a silver lining in all that sewage: . ‘Viral campaign for Bounty?’ Run for your lives!

""Even though we presume that the body found is that of Gerardo Nales, investigators are pending 'official identification' from the Medical Examiner's Office,"" said Miami-Dade Police Department spokesman Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, in a statement. The body was discovered at 10:30 a.m., he said. Authorities had been looking for the Key Biscayne man since a pilot's mayday distress call sent them scrambling.

The pilot said he was flying Thursday afternoon at an altitude of 1,800 feet about two miles from shore when the incident occurred. The search was called off later that night and resumed Friday at daybreak. A police spokeswoman said it was unclear whether Nales accidentally fell out of the plane or deliberately jumped.

Renovated only a couple of years ago, ahead of the Euro 2012 football championships co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland, the airport is estimated to have cost almost £500m. But now the airport that welcomed travelling football fans from across the globe has been reduced to a heap of twisted metal, and its runway is filled with burnt-out tanks and abandoned airliners.

'Like being awake in a coma': Teenager Shannon Magee suffers from a rare disorder which makes her sleep for nearly a fortnight at a time . A teenager has been dubbed a real-life 'Sleeping Beauty' after being struck down by a medical condition which makes her nod off for almost 12 days at a time. Former army cadet Shannon Magee, 17, suffers from a rare neurological disorder which means she can sleep for 22 hours a day for almost a fortnight. She also has bizarre episodes - roughly once a . month - where she will belt out pop songs at the top of her voice, walk . around naked and have ghostly hallucinations while she sleeps. For the past five years, the youngster, who has two brothers and three sisters, has slept through birthdays, Christmases, family holidays including a skiing trip to the Alps and even her GCSE exams. Shannon was seen by various doctors before finally being diagnosed with Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) after her father, Christopher Dodd, researched her symptoms online. There are only 45 people in the UK who have the condition, which is a complex neurological disorder characterised by periods of excessive amounts of sleep and altered behaviour. The teenager wants to become a nurse so she can help others, but is worried her condition will get in the way of her dream. Shannon, a college student in Bolton, Greater Manchester said: 'It is like being awake in a coma. It takes part of your life away with it. 'It's like I'm in my own little world and I don't recognise people. When I'm awake it's like I'm sleepwalking. 'The year when Alexandra Burke went on . X Factor was particularly bad for my parents as I kept singing . Hallelujah for four days solid. What makes it worse is that I can't sing . at all and I only knew the chorus to the song. 'I was like a broken record on repeat and just kept singing hallelujah over and over again.' Shannon has episodes each month, which usually last about 12 days, during which time she can sleep for about 22 hours per day. When she is awake, her behaviour changes as she can become aggressive and demands sweets and chocolate, and needs around-the-clock care from her parents. 'It takes part of your likfe away with it': Shannon, 17, suffers from Kleine-Levin Syndrome, which is sometimes called Sleeping Beauty syndrome . Bizarre episodes: The condition also makes the former Army cadet belt out pop songs, walk around naked and have ghostly hallucinations while she sleeps . It also affects her memory, and she says huge chunks of her teenage years are blank. Shannon added: 'My memory of when it first happened was playing in the pool with my brother Jake. I just started singing JLS really loud but I can't really remember much else. 'Then all I wanted to do was sleep, I think everyone thought I must have been bored or tired. I'd just crash and in the morning I'd have to be dragged out of bed. 'My family thought I was trying to be awkward and lazy and they had to literally pull the quilt off me and out of bed. It must have been very maddening. 'I think they thought I was being an obnoxious teenager. Looking back, the first time I started singing they didn't think much of it because they thought I'd been bitten by something.' She said the second episode happened when she returned to school in the September. Mystery solved: Shannon was seen by various doctors before finally being diagnosed after her father, Christopher Dodd (pictured), researched her symptoms online . 'I had just gone into Year 9,' she added. 'I was in my English lesson and I kept falling asleep. I had an . overwhelming urge that I had to go to sleep. 'I . kept getting told off and I got moved to the front of the class. I . actually fell asleep in class and my teacher shouted at me and she moved . me to the front of the class. 'I . couldn't help it though as I just felt overwhelmingly tired. I couldn't . keep awake and ended up getting sent to the head of year's office. As . far as the school was concerned, I was just being rude.' She said she saw various doctors who were unable to help. She . said: 'I was like a machine, I ate like a pig and slept. I binged on . Galaxy chocolate and wine gum sweets or anything which I could get my . hands on and then I'd go back to bed for three or four days and then I'd . come out of it. Missed treasured moments: Shannon, pictured with her family, has slept through birthdays, Christmases, holidays including a skiing trip to the Alps and even her GCSE exams . 'In the meantime, my stepdad thought that he would have a look on the internet at sleeping disorders and saw one which ticked every box. 'When it happens I get a feeling like a rush up through my chest to my neck and then I get a headache all day. I'd describe the feeling as similar to a panic attack, it starts in my chest and the feeling moves up to my throat.' Shannon is now on medication normally used for epilepsy sufferers. KLS is a neurological condition that starts during adolescence and sometimes will begin after an infection or illness. It is characterised by periods of excessive sleep of up to 22 hours a day. This symptom lasts between days and weeks. During such an episode a sufferer may be irritable, childish, disorientated and want to eat excessive amounts of food. Patients are fine between episodes. Shannon is just one of 1,000 people worldwide to suffer from the disorder which is commonly known as Sleeping Beauty Syndrome. Around 70per cent of sufferers are male. There is no known cure for the disorder. She went on: 'I miss parties, Christmases and every year when we go away I have an episode, I even missed some of my GCSEs because of it. I completely fell asleep in my English Literature exam. 'I wouldn't remember if I had gone out because I'd be so spaced out in a dreamlike state. When I am in the middle of an episode I am like a zombie. 'I've just come to accept it now, although it is frustrating. I don't know when the episodes will come to an end it's like a waiting game.' Her mother, Julie Ratcliffe, 56, said: 'They were taking blood tests because they thought she was drunk or on drugs, then they thought it was epilepsy. 'Even when we go to appointments and it is on her medical records, the doctors don't know what it is. 'When she is in an episode it can be very stressful and she can be very challenging. She has a vague expression on her face and I can get about 50 texts at work asking for things because she has forgotten she has already texted. She added: 'We feel better knowing it is not life-threatening, but there is not enough information, nobody knows the answers.'","Shannon Magee has rare neurological disorder called Kleine-Levin Syndrome .

ff522b1659343457d9da2e54efd7b14c35e4b0f1,"(CNN)  -- Police are investigating whether a North Carolina country road may have become the dumping ground for a serial killer, a man one woman believes could have given her a terrifying ride she will never forget. Jackie Nikelia Thorpe's body was found along Seven Bridges Road in August 2007. Since May 2005, the remains of five women have been found near Seven Bridges Road outside Rocky Mount, North Carolina. The road snakes northeast out of town into rural Edgecombe County. Rocky Mount Police Chief John Manley Jr. thinks the women's deaths are related. ""They seem to have some connection,"" he said. Lanessa Williams of Rocky Mount thinks she narrowly missed joining the ranks of the slain women, saying she is not sure whether a man who offered her a ride to a friend's house last year is responsible for their deaths. The longer the two drove, the more she felt a sense of danger, said Williams, 38. The man -- whom she described as thin and African-American, with a mustache and glasses -- rarely spoke and ""looked crazy."" ""He kept on going, and he rode through lights, and he wouldn't let me get out,"" she said. Eventually, her fears were confirmed when he demanded sex. ""He told me that if I didn't do what he wanted me to do, he was going to kill me and throw me in the river."" The man eventually stopped his truck in a dark wilderness area, she said. When he got out, she ran away. ""I laid in a ditch and stayed there for a while,"" she said. ""He was riding around looking for me."" Police are talking to Williams about her experience. She told authorities she noticed something strange: The large block letters saying ""Chevrolet"" on the back of the man's truck appeared to be painted on. All five of the slain women were African-American, authorities said. Four lived in Rocky Mount, about 55 miles northeast of the state capital, Raleigh. According to the Edgecombe County Sheriff's Office, they were: . • Melody Wiggins, 29, whose body was found May 29, 2005. • Jackie Nikelia Thorpe, 35, whose body was found August 17, 2007, behind a house on Seven Bridges Road. • Ernestine Battle, 50, whose remains were found in a wooded area on the road March 13, 2008. • Taraha Shenice Nicholson, 28, whose remains were discovered March 7, 2009. • Jarneice Latonya Hargrove, 31, whose skeletal remains were found June 29, 2009, in the woods off the road. Manley said it appears that the women ""suffered a similar death,"" but authorities are not divulging further details, including the cause of the deaths. Edgecombe County Sheriff James L. Knight is leading the investigation, working with Rocky Mount police and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation. The three agencies have created a joint task force to investigate the unsolved killings. Knight is asking the public to be vigilant. ""Watch for vehicles if they are on a path or stop along that roadway, and give us a call.""

A High Court catfight has erupted between the bosses of a top London modelling agency and a former catwalk king whom they accuse of poaching models, 'fraud' and breach of contract. Brazilian rising star Talita Correa is among the models allegedly diverted away from the agency to a rival business set up by Jon Bruce. Premier Model Management - whose staff and models are the subject of the C4 series ‘The Model Agency’- has accused Mr Bruce of poaching models while still under their employment. A top judge has heard that the former . male model was so good at his job that, at times, he generated a third . of Premier's income. Mr Bruce was dismissed from his position on July 24 and he was served with court papers on the same day. The case has now reached London’s . High Court, with Rupert Butler, for the agency, telling Judge Michael . Kent QC that Mr Bruce is accused of 'diverting away' models from Premier . to a rival modelling business - whilst still in the agency’s employ. Mr Butler also accused Mr Bruce of . 'perpetrating a very serious fraud' whilst working for Premier and of . breaching his contract of employment. Mr . Bruce is claimed to have tried to gain an unfair competitive advantage . for new model management venture, Paulo Ribero Management Ltd (PRM), . which he is alleged to have started up in January this year with . business partner, Paulo Ribero. The . allegations of diverting models relate to three individuals who are on . the books of PRM, Mr Butler told the court, including Brazilian rising . star, Talita Correa, and Matthew Holbrook, a Rochdale model, who was the . runner up of C4’s Model Behaviour show. Paulo Ribero and PRM are also defendants in the action. Talita Correa, left, and Matthew Holbrook, . right, are two of the models Bruce is accused of 'diverting' from his . former employers . Nasty: The claws are out between Premier Model Management Ltd - whose staff and models were the subject of C4 series 'The Model Agency' - and one of the stars of show, Jon Bruce, back left . Mr Butler told the judge: 'What we . have here is a case of real damage that has been perpetrated on the . claimant and we want to get on with this case and find out exactly what . the damage is, so we can get on with rectifying the situation with our . customers, our clients and models. 'There . is a prima facie case that a very serious fraud has been perpetrated,' he added, asking for the judge to make an interim order that Mr Bruce . disclose to his former employers 'all confidential information or . property in his possession, but belonging to the claimant.' The barrister said Premier - whose boss . Carole White and chief booker Aidan Jean-Marie attended the hearing - . were seeking that order because, 'Mr Bruce still isn’t coming to heel . and doing that which he needs to do to remedy the situation he had . created.' 'Mr Bruce has acted for eight or nine . months completely behind our backs and deceitfully. We don’t know what . he’s done. We want him to tell us what he’s been up to,' the barrister . said. Emily Betts, for Mr Bruce, Mr Ribero . and PRM, asked for the application for the 'onerous order' to be . rejected, saying that it would unfairly restrict Mr Bruce’s ability to . earn a living when no wrongdoing has been proved against him. She . described Mr Bruce as 'good at his job, well known in the industry and . he has a lot of contacts,' saying the claim was 'an attempt to stifle . him and prevent him earning money doing his job and using his skills . elsewhere.'

Judge Kent, delivering his ruling, . allowed Premier Models’ application for disclosure, giving Mr Bruce . seven days in which to produce the material requested. Legal arguments: The case at the High Court, pictured, has heard that Mr Bruce has been accused of 'perpetrating a very serious fraud' whilst working for Premier and of breaching his contract of employment . The . judge said: 'This is case where it is alleged that Mr Bruce, who was an . employee of the claimant since 2007, has been in breach of the terms of . his employment contract by taking steps to set up a rival business with . his business partner Mr Ribero from January this year. 'It . is said that he has been passing on copyrighted information and other . material with a view to gaining an advantage for the rival business. 'There is a clear prima facie case of a . flagrant breach of those obligations which Mr Bruce owed and would have . realised on the face of it were his obligations, and would justify in my . judgement various forms of relief. 'This is a case where serious allegations are made that £850 was charged to clients of Premier Models which related to a model of PRM’s. I don’t see how that can be anything but an attempt to defraud Premier Models,' he went on. 'In all the circumstances, it seems to me that, while the orders may be onerous, there is a strong arguable case for interim relief. The claimants are entitled to protect their business,' he said.

The Senate confirmed Janet Yellen on Monday as the . first woman to lead the Federal Reserve, elevating an advocate of fighting . unemployment and a backer of the central bank's efforts to spur the economy . with low interest rates and massive bond purchases. Ms Yellen, 67, will replace Ben Bernanke, who is . stepping down after serving as chairman for eight years dominated by the Great . Recession and the Fed's efforts to combat it. Senators confirmed her by 56-26, with numerous . absences caused by airline flight delays forced by arctic temperatures around . much of the country. All 45 voting Democrats were joined by 11 Republicans in . supporting Ms Yellen, while 26 Republicans voted 'no.' She's in!: Dr. Janet Yellen speaking during her confirmation hearing of  the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee earlier this year . Vice chair of the Fed since 2010, Ms Yellen begins her . four-year term as leader of the century-old bank on Feb. 1. With the economy . rebounding from the depths of the recession but only modestly so far, many . economists expect her to focus on how to nurture growth without putting it into . overdrive, which could risk fueling inflation. 'The big debate will be when the Fed should . tighten and how much, rather than when to step on the gas pedal and how . hard,' predicted Bill Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial . Services, who envisions a growing economy this year. Under Bernanke, the Fed has driven short-term . interest rates down to near zero and flushed money into the economy with huge . bond purchases, which it has just started to ease. Ms Yellen, a strong Bernanke . ally, has supported those policies and is expected to continue them until . concrete signs emerge of sustained improvement of the economy and job market. In a written statement, President Barack Obama said . Yellen's approval means 'the American people will have a fierce . champion' who will protect them. 'I am confident that Janet will stand up for . American workers, protect consumers, foster the stability of our financial . system and help keep our economy growing for years to come,' Mr Obama said. Lobbyists for the banking and financial services . sectors issued statements pledging to work with Ms Yellen. Both industries have . led a fight to water down restrictions imposed by Mr Obama's 2010 law overhauling . how the nation's financial system is regulated. The big moment:  U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) speaks to members of the press as she is on her way for a vote January 6, 2014 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. Janet Yellen was confirmed by the Senate with a vote of 56 - 26 to become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve Board . A native of Brooklyn, N.Y., Ms Yellen previously . headed the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, chaired President Bill . Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers and has been an economics professor at . the University of California at Berkeley. Ms Yellen, who as an academic has focused on . unemployment and its causes, is considered a 'dove' who wants the Fed . more focused on creating jobs because unemployment is high and inflation is . low. 'Hawks' on these issues prefer a stronger emphasis on preventing . inflation. In brief debate on her nomination, Sen. Sherrod . Brown, D-Ohio, lauded Ms Yellen, who was one of the first to warn in 2007 of a . housing bubble that could burst and damage the entire economy. 'She understands how risky financial practices . deep inside the largest Wall Street banks can have a terrible and terrifying . impact on American families,' Brown said. But Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, criticized . Ms Yellen for supporting the Fed's 'easy money' policies of low interest . rates and bond purchases. 'No one can deny that the risks are real and . could be devastating' if those policies continue for too long, Mr Grassley . said. Ms Yellen's GOP critics have said the Fed has inflated . stock and real estate prices by pumping money into the markets, creating . investment bubbles that could burst and wound the economy anew. Some also warn that as the Fed starts to trim its . bond holdings, it could spook financial markets, threatening the economy's . recovery by causing stock prices to drop and interest rates to rise. Last month, the Fed announced that it will start . gradually reducing its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases, trimming them . back initially to $75 billion this month and taking 'further measured . steps' as economic conditions improve. But the Fed also indicated that it will keep . supporting an economy that it considers less than fully healthy. It said it . will continue to keep interest rates low and try to boost unusually low . inflation, which can slow spending and borrowing. Before the vote: Then-Federal Reserve Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen attending an event Dec 16 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Federal Reserve Act at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC . During her November confirmation hearing before the . Senate Banking Committee, Ms Yellen said the Fed's bond buying program has . successfully supported the economy by keeping long-term borrowing rates low. The Fed's holdings have reached $4 trillion, more . than quadruple their level before the financial crisis hit in late 2008. The U.S. economy has grown only modestly since the . Great Recession officially ended in June 2009, though it has shown encouraging . signs in recent months. Unemployment fell to 7 percent last month, down . from a recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009. The economy grew at an annual . rate of 4.1 percent from July through September and has added an average . 200,000 jobs monthly since August. President Barack Obama nominated Yellen in October . after considering selecting Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury secretary who . had been a close Obama adviser early in his presidency. Summers withdrew after . opponents complained about his temperament and past support for bank . deregulation. Mr Obama called Ms Yellen a 'proven leader' and . hailed her frequent focus on the unemployed, saying, 'She understands the . human cost when people can't find a job.' She will be the first Fed chair newly appointed by . a Democratic president since Paul Volcker, picked by President Jimmy Carter, left . the post in 1987. Mr Clinton reappointed Alan Greenspan and Mr Obama gave Bernanke a . second term, though both were initially chosen by GOP presidents.

It seems like the Holiday season starts earlier every year, with Christmas lights on store shelves in October, and carols on the radio before Thanksgiving. But for Bronx chef Jon Lovtich, the season started even earlier than most, last February. That's when he started constructing Gingerbread Lane, the entirely edible gingerbread village recently deemed the world's largest by Guinness World Records. (The world's largest gingerbread house went to a construction in Texas that didn't qualify for the edible prize since the frame was made of wood.) The 1.5 ton cookie construction currently spans 300-square-feet at the New York Hall of Science in Queens. For perspective, that's as heavy as a large hippopotamus and the size as a two-car garage. Scroll down for video . Cookie city: Gingerbread Lane at the New York Hall of Science is the largest edible gingerbread village in the world, spanning 300-square feet and weighing 1.5 tons . All coming together: The gingerbread monolith was created entirely by chef Jon Lovitch, who has been baking and constructing the pieces individually in his Bronx apartment since last February . For the past year, 37-year-old Lovitch has been baking and building the village's houses, ice rink, firehouse, and railroad stations at his apartment in the Bronx near Yankee Stadium. He says he's spent a 'few grand' on the project, buying 400 pounds of candy, ingredients for 500 pounds of gingerbread dough and 2,240 pounds of icing. Unsurprisingly the cookie construction packs quite the calorie count. The dough is the the most dangerous with over 958,000 calories, the decorators icing amounts to around 423,000 and if all 400 pounds of candy were from candy canes, that would mean nearly 699,000 calories. Mr Lovtich says he saves money by buying ingredients anytime he's out of the city, cleaning out rural supermarkets of flour, candy and sugar. Making the gingerbread village came second to his job as the executive chef at the New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge, and most of the baking and construction took place after midnight while his wife was asleep. Ongoing project: Mr Lovitch started assembling the village as a whole this fall when he began driving the 164 structures from his apartment to the space in Queens. He continues to add to it even midway through December . 'My wife likes the fact that I work on it at home and I'm not out gambling or drinking,' he told the New York Times. It wasn't until this fall that Mr Lovitch started driving the 164 structures stored in his apartment's empty bedroom to the Hall of Science for assembly in the days leading up to the November 17 opening. And he continues to add to the structure even midway into December. The artist's mother, Vickie Lovitch, calls her son a 'gingerbread Santa Claus' and told the Times that his obsession with Christmas started at a young age when he would string 10,000 Christmas lights outside their house. Admirers: Lisa Grillo accompanies Emily, 8, and Kate, 9, as they look at the Gingerbread Lane, on December 12 . His focus on gingerbread as a medium came when he was a teenager, and he lost a competition in his hometown of Kansas City, Missouri. Since then, he's been trying to make up for that initial loss, making bigger and better constructions each year as he moved around the country, from Washington, DC to Pittsburgh. Last January he moved to New York City with the express purpose of getting more attention for his gingerbread making, and hopefully turning the hobby into a full-time career making and teaching gingerbread architecture. Not for the calorie counter: Mr Lovitch says he spent a 'few grand' on the project which is made of 400 pounds of candy, 500 pounds of gingerbread dough and 2,240 of icing . 'Being a chef, people may remember my meals for a day or two, but with the gingerbread, I can get thousands of people at a time to checkout out my work,' he said. 'I've gotten emails a year later, thanking me for it.' Gingerbread Lane can be viewed at the Hall of Sciences in Queens until January 12 - the day it will be disassembled and visitors can take pieces of the village home with them to eat. Those pieces baked in early February might be a little stale though. Mr Lovtich also has another gingerbread village in the city this winter, at the Marriott. It's three stories high with 75 structures and he's been baking it out of the hotel's kitchen. Tasty: Gingerbread Lane will be on view until January 12 when it will be dissembled and visitors can take pieces of the houses home with them to snack on .","Gingerbread Lane was deemed the world's largest edible gingerbread village by Guinness World Records .

Pointing to the states' growth rates, demographers say it's not a question of if, but when. ""If it doesn't happen this year -- it probably will -- but if not, probably next year,"" said Thomas Boswell, a University of Miami geography professor who studies population. ""It doesn't surprise demographers,"" Boswell said, ""we have seen it coming for a long time."" On Monday, the U.S. Census Bureau releases its latest population estimates. Stan Smith, population program director at the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR), agreed with Boswell that Florida likely will overtake New York at some point in 2014 or 2015. From April 2010 to July 2012, Florida's population grew 2.7%, according to census data. In the same period, New York's grew 1%. The national average was 1.7%. Last year's census estimate had the two states virtually neck and neck: New York's population was just under 19.6 million, only about 250,000 higher than Florida's. ""The really, really simple thing is that Florida and New York are growing, but Florida is growing faster,"" said Andrew Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College in New York. While New York City and its surrounding suburbs, the Albany area, and Ithaca are all growing, much of upstate New York is experiencing declines in population, Beveridge said. Manufacturing jobs have diminished in northern New York cities like Rochester, Buffalo and Syracuse. Florida, on the other hand, is seeing jump in tourism, real estate, construction, medicine and finance, Boswell said. But immigration is also an important factor in explaining Florida's rise. ""Florida's growth for many years has been due primarily to migration,"" Smith said. ""Typically, 80 to 90% of growth in the state has to do with people moving in."" The spike in immigration includes people moving from other states as well as from abroad, Smith said. Based on responses to BEBR surveys, Smith said, most people moving to Florida do so for job-related reasons. The state also draws retirees seeking a warmer climate. If Florida surpasses New York in population, it likely will end up with more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2010, after the release of new census data, New York lost two seats and Florida gained two. Both states now have 27 House members. California, with an estimated population of 38 million in 2012, and Texas (26 million) are the nation's two most populous states.","New York could soon trail Florida in population .

""We are witnessing unprecedented levels of violence against children. More and more children are being recruited into armed groups, and they are also being directly targeted in atrocious revenge attacks,"" said Souleymane Diabate, UNICEF representative in the nation. Number of child soldiers doubles . Late last year, the U.N. said the number of child soldiers in the nation had doubled to 6,000 as violence escalated. ""Targeted attacks against children are a violation of international humanitarian and human rights law and must stop immediately.

More than 935,000 people have been internally displaced nationwide, the U.N. refugee agency said on Friday. Chaos, violence . The nation plunged into chaos after a coalition of rebels named Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize in March, the latest in a series of coups since the nation gained independence. They accused him of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down. Months before his ouster, both sides had brokered a deal to form a unity government led by the President. But that deal fell apart as the rebel coalition pushed its way from the north toward the capital of Bangui, seizing towns along the way. Rebels infiltrated the capital in March, sending Bozize fleeing to Cameroon. Fears of genocide . Since then, political turmoil raged and violence became the order of the day. Seleka is a predominantly Muslim coalition, and to counter the attacks, vigilante Christian groups fought back. The country descended into anarchy, and the United Nations has warned that a genocide is brewing. Aid agencies have warned of a humanitarian crisis as rapes, killings and other horrors grow in the nation.  An unknown number of people have been killed in remote rural areas that are too risky to access. Others have fled into forests.

ff53e0986ad13ad424a6821fd19afe91029887ce,"(CNN) -- A snowplow driver who's been blamed by Russian authorities for a plane crash that killed the chief executive of the oil company Total has been sent to pretrial detention, his lawyer said Thursday. Snowplow driver Vladimir Martynenko has denied claims by Russian officials that he was drunk at the time of the crash Monday at Moscow's Vnukovo International Airport. Total CEO Christophe de Margerie and three others were killed after his plane hit the snowplow during takeoff and crashed. Four other airport employees have also been detained in connection with the crash, a Russian investigative committee said earlier. They are: the airport service chief engineer, Vladimir Ledenev, who's in charge of snow-clearing operations; flights director Roman Dunayev; air traffic controller Svetlana Krivsun; and the airport's chief air traffic controller, Alexander Kruglov. ""Investigators believe the detained persons failed to provide safety requirements concerning flights and on-ground works and it led to the tragedy,"" a statement from the investigative committee said. ""They have been detained and questioned as suspects in the case."" Amid the fallout from the incident, the airport's director general, Andrei Dyakov, and deputy director general Sergei Solntsev have resigned, the airport said in a statement Thursday. Their resignations have been accepted. The airport's shift director, the head of the airport's maintenance division and the leading engineer who heads the shift have been suspended from duties. Blood test . Martynenko's lawyer, Aleksandr Karabanov, told CNN that a court decided Thursday to place him in detention. ""The judge explained her decision, saying that the court decided that Martynenko could escape, put pressure on trial participants or destroy the evidence,"" Karabanov said. He said the judge had also introduced a doctor's certificate with results of a preliminary medical examination. She said that according to that data, Martynenko was found to be drunk, but the final results would be known and announced in five to seven days. ""I found it's ridiculous and it makes no sense,"" Karabanov said. ""During that medical examination, Martynenko had a blood test that would show whether there was alcohol in his blood. It always takes only a day or two to get the results. Why are we still not given any?"" He said he was convinced his client was sober at the time. Log book . Karabanov said at a news conference Wednesday that Martynenko had passed a daily ""medical examination"" that all snowplow operators at the airport are required to take before reporting for duty. The lawyer said the results of the test were recorded in a log book that investigators now have. According to the lawyer, Martynenko became separated from a convoy of snowplows after he heard a strange sound and stopped briefly to check his equipment. The lawyer speculated that an unnamed air traffic controller saw the other snowplows in the convoy and cleared the runway without realizing that Martynenko's machine was still there. The French government has deployed three investigators and two technical consultants from its aviation authority to also investigate the crash.

ff544cbc9ce6ea7e67470458f8172a8544ea7d3b,"A Florida woman accused of killing a neighbor was indicted on a first-degree murder charge Wednesday after it was revealed in court that she allegedly hacked the victim’s body into pieces and tried to cremate them using her stove after drugging and stabbing him to death. Angela Stoldt, 42, of Deltona, was arrested in April 2013 in connection to the killing of James Sheaffer and was initially charged with second-degree murder. On Wednesday, a grand jury indicted her on charges of abuse of a dead body and tampering with physical evidence, on top of the upgraded first-degree murder charge. Gruesome murder: Angela Stoldt, 42 (left), allegedly stabbed neighbor James Sheaffer, 36 (right), with an ice pick, strangled him and then tried to dispose of his body by hacking it to pieces and cooking the remains . Crime scene: Stoldt got into an argument with Sheaffer while sitting in her car at the Osteen Cemetery in Deltona in April 2013 . Prosecutors said they will not be seeking the death penalty in Stoldt's case. In September, Stold's attorney filed a motion claiming self defense under Florida's controversial 'stand your ground' law, but Judge Randell Rowe III rejected the motion. Court documents obtained by Daytona News-Journal this week revealed chilling new details about the 2013 murder and its gruesome aftermath. James Sheaffer, a limousine driver and a married father of three, had reportedly asked his neighbor, Ms Stoldt, to act as the payee on his Social Security disability benefits, but the 36-year-old kept overdrawing their joint account. The limo driver also wanted Stoldt to ask her father for a $4,000 loan. On the morning of April 3, 2013, Stoldt, with her two children in tow, picked up her neighbor from his work at Blue Diamond Limousines and drove to her home on Horseshoe Terrace, where the two drank vodka and peach schnapps cocktails. But according to court filings, the mother of two spiked her neighbor's beverage with a prescription pain medication, which she had stolen from her father knowing that it causes drowsiness, especially when mixed with alcohol. Stoldt then allegedly loaded the drugged man into her car and drove to the Osteen Cemetery after dropping the kids off at her parents'. Husband and father: Sheaffer, who was married with three kids, was stabbed in the eye and then strangled; police were never able to locate all of his remains . By the time the two reached the burial ground, Sheaffer and Stoldt got into a heated dispute over the loan. ‘Sheaffer said that he was going to kill Ms. Stoldt as well as her children,’ the stand-you-ground motion stated. During questioning, Stoldt told detectives that Sheaffer started yelling at her and 'swinging his hands around.’ The woman said that while Sheaffer never actually hit her, he started coming at her in a threatening manner, making her fearful for her life. 'I just snapped,' she was quoted as saying. 'He came at me and I stabbed him.' That is when Stoldt pulled an ice pick from a box in the backseat and plunged it into his right eye, but the burly limo driver allegedly kept coming at her. She then grabbed a cord with two handles and used it to strangle Sheaffer by wrapping it tightly around his neck. After the man stopped moving, the 42-year-old mother grabbed the ice pick again and drove it through Sheaffer's left eye. She then wrapped the man's head in Saran Wrap to keep him from bleeding all over the car interior and drove home, with Sheaffer's corpse propped up in the passenger seat, the ice pick still protruding from his face. After parking her car in her garage, Stoldt shoved her dead neighbor's body out of the car and plopped it in a kiddie pool, leaving it there for the night. The following morning, the suspect allegedly went to work hacking James Sheaffer's body to pieces with a hacksaw. Life and death situation: Stoldt's attorney filed a motion claiming that the woman was in fear for her life because Sheaffer was threatening to kill her and her two children . According to the judge's order rejecting the self-defense motion, Miss Stoldt told police she had tried to 'destroy the evidence by cooking and cremating body parts.' The woman reportedly said that she put some of Sheaffer's remains into pots and tried simmering them on the stovetop, and also placed one of his legs in the oven hoping to burn it. Having failed that, Stoldt dumped the mutilated body parts in trash bags and disposed of them with the help of her teenage son, who was led to believe that they were getting rid of a deer his mother had killed with her car the night before. To cover up the murder, Miss Stoldt then buried her neighbor's cellphone and driver’s license in different parks, and got rid of the pots and pans used to boil human flesh. When Stoldt's daughter, who is now 16 years old, asked her about the foul smell lingering in the house, the 42-year-old woman initially lied that a rat had gotten trapped inside the oven. But she eventually came clean to the girl, telling her that she had drugged and killed James Sheaffer after he threatened to kill her. However, it was not until three weeks later that Angela Stoldt confessed to the rest of her family, prompting her sister to call 911 on April 21 because she was afraid the distraught, sleep-deprived woman might commit suicide. In the course of her questioning, Miss Stoldt spoke without hesitation of her attempts to dispose of her neighbor's corpse. 'Thursday is when I was cooking him. Friday is when I was dumping him,' she was quoted as saying. The woman showed little remorse for her actions, telling police she believed at the time Sheaffer was going to ruin her life. ‘I’m sorry, but I put Jimmie where he belonged, in my opinion at the time,’ she told detectives. Ms Stoldt eventually led sheriff's deputies to various locations around Volusia County to help recover James Sheaffer's remains, but officials said they were never able to locate all of Sheaffer's body parts. Confrontation: Sheaffer, a limo driver, allegedly attacked Stoldt while sitting in her car and would not let go of her until she wrapped a cord around his neck . Investigators who canvassed Sheaffer’s Deltona neighborhood looking for the missing man before Stoldt’s confession had talked to the woman on more than one occasion. She acknowledged being friends with Sheaffer and said she handled some of his financial affairs for him. She told investigators that she last saw Sheaffer on April 5 and 15, even though family members hadn’t seen him since April 2. The investigation took a turn April 20 when Stoldt’s sister called 911 saying that the mother of two was acting suicidal and had admitted to killing James Sheaffer. The caller told the Sheriff’s office that Stoldt was hugging her children and saying goodbye. ‘Why’s she hugging her kids goodbye?’ the emergency dispatcher asked. ‘Because she came to the house and she told my parents that she committed a crime and that she’s being investigated for it,’ the woman’s sister replied. Ms Stoldt initially declined to talk to investigators and was taken in for a mental health evaluation. But officials were able to obtain a search warrant to enter her house, where they came upon evidence indicating a crime had been committed there. A short time later, Angela Stoldt confessed to stabbing and strangling Sheaffer, and then disposing of his body. Stoldt then led investigators to a location where human remains were recovered. Ms Stoldt is being held without bail.","Angela Stoldt, 42, confessed to killing limo driver James Sheaffer, 36, in April 2013 by stabbing him in the face and strangling him with a cord .

Helping hand: A report by the University of Buffalo found that being generous to friends, neighbours and relatives can improve our health . It has long been said that it’s better to give than receive. Now scientists have revealed that the benefits of generosity extend beyond a warm glow. Providing tangible help to others appears to protect our health and lengthens our lives, they claim. A five-year study of 846 individuals found that when dealing with stressful situations, those who had helped others during the previous year were less likely to die than those who had not. Stressful experiences included such things as serious illness, burglary, job loss, financial difficulties or death of a family member. Respondents reported the amount of time in the past 12 months they had spent helping friends, neighbours or relatives not living with them by providing transport, running errands, doing shopping, performing housework, looking after children and other tasks. Michael J. Poulin, of the University at Buffalo in the US, said: ‘This study offers a significant contribution…to our understanding of how giving assistance to others may offer health benefits to the giver by buffering the negative effects of stress.’ He added: ‘Our conclusion is that helping others reduced mortality specifically by buffering the association between stress and mortality.' He added: 'As the title of our study indicates we tested the hypothesis that providing help to others . would predict a reduced association between stress and mortality for the . helpers. 'Specifically, over the five years of the study, we found that . when dealing with stressful situations, those who had helped others . during the previous year were less likely to die than those who had not . helped others.' The five-year study of 846 individuals found that when dealing with stressful situations, those who had helped others during the previous year were less likely to die than those who had not . He said: 'When we adjusted for age, baseline health . and functioning and key psychosocial variables, the Cox . proportional hazard models (the most widely used method of survival . analysis) for mortality revealed a significant interaction between . helping behavior, stressful events, morbidity and mortality. 'Our conclusion is that helping others reduced mortality . specifically by buffering the association between stress and mortality. 'These findings go beyond past analyses to indicate that the health . benefits of helping behavior derive specifically from stress-buffering . processes and provide important guidance for . understanding why helping behavior specifically may promote health and, . potentially, for how social processes in general may influence health. The study – in conjunction with Stony Brook University and Grand Valley State University – points out that although it is known that social isolation and stress have significant impacts on health, research has failed to establish whether receiving support from others helps protect individuals from stress in the same way as ‘givers’. The report will be published in the American Journal of Public Health.","Scientists from America's University of Buffalo conducted five-year study .

ff563bb80672dc7e9625bf8f318fcda25baf1264,"(CNN) -- Can you remember what you were doing 30 years ago? In 1983, Bjorn Borg retired from a glittering tennis career, the Nazi Klaus Barbie was officially charged with war crimes and the final episode of M*A*S*H was breaking TV records. More importantly, for the purpose of this exercise, millions of black and ""non-white"" South Africans were living -- and dying -- in misery under a brutal apartheid regime. Whatever you were doing back then, I would think it unlikely that any single decision you made has shaped what has become of your life since. That's not the case, however, for the young black cricketers that left the Caribbean to play in South Africa. For them, everything changed the day they boarded a plane for Johannesburg. They are the focus of CNN's documentary ""World Sport Presents: Branded a Rebel."" In 1977, the Commonwealth nations added a sporting ban to their campaign against apartheid in South Africa. By isolating the country's teams and starving passionate and influential South Africans of their beloved sport, it was hoped their government would be forced into changing policies that discriminated against a majority of the population. As a result, cricket's ""Rebel Tours"" were highly controversial, unofficial, international matches that were organized in defiance of those sanctions. It was an issue that split the world's cricket community right down the middle. The invited players that declined, such as England's Ian Botham and West Indian Viv Richards, took a strong moral stance in opposition. Contact 'Branded as a rebel' presenter Don Riddell on Facebook . But, whether from England, Australia or Sri Lanka, the massive financial inducements were often too much even for some of the sport's biggest names to refuse. For each of the seven tours, there was outcry, but it was the West Indies' role that provoked the most outrage. These men didn't steal anything -- they certainly didn't kill anyone -- and they didn't break any laws, but their ""crime"" was almost worse. They were condemned for supporting an abhorrent, racist regime; effectively betraying their own race. Ironically, it was they who were isolated. They were banished from playing international sport and shunned by their peers and communities; many were forced to relocate abroad. Only one ever played for the Windies again. Hardly anything has been written or broadcast about their two tours between 1982-84, a period which has been described as one of the darkest chapters in the history of cricket. Whatever views have been articulated are typically negative, damning and highly critical of the players and those who funded and organized the matches. The common narrative is that they were mercenaries, traitors and rebels. But while the players can't deny that many were influenced by the money -- some were paid in excess of $100,000 for a month of cricket -- some would prefer to be known as missionaries. Pioneers. Crusaders. I knew it wouldn't be easy getting them to talk about their experience, just tracking them down was hard enough. For obvious reasons the West Indies Cricket Board, which had banned them, wasn't much use. Some of the players like Herbert Chang and Richard Austin -- known to have struggled with substance abuse -- have effectively fallen off the grid. Trying to forget . Of those we tracked down, it soon became clear very few had any interest in reliving the experience. It wasn't the tours that they didn't want to revisit, but the judgment and condemnation they had endured since. Some players flatly declined, others wanted to be paid outrageous sums; CNN's policy is not to pay for interviews. Over a period of several weeks, myself and our producer Samantha Bresnahan had a series of exhaustive exchanges with the team's captain Lawrence Rowe, a talented batsman who was forced to leave Jamaica and settle in Miami. We really thought he was close to giving an interview but ultimately he declined. I know he desperately wanted to tell his side of the story, a side which has never been heard before, but he was concerned his involvement would only reignite the controversy. He just couldn't take the risk. I would say that the players who did speak with us had mixed reasons for giving their interviews. Franklyn Stephenson is known as the greatest player never to have played for the Windies, but he is proud of his involvement. He still treasures his tour blazer and the team photo sits proudly on his shelf. He genuinely believes that the tours helped to change attitudes in South Africa, claiming that for the first time in their lives, white fans were able to see that the black race was at the very least equal, if not superior, to theirs. Of all the rebel teams, the West Indies were the only one to win a Test match in South Africa. West Indian society's 'running wound' Collis King, a hero of the Windies' 1979 World Cup final victory, felt the same. He was still angry at his treatment and we didn't have to scratch too far beneath the surface to find the bitterness still simmering. I believe that both men and the former wicketkeeper David Murray talked to us because they didn't have anything else to lose -- whatever the tour had once cost them, being associated with it could no longer hurt them. That's not the case for the likes of Emmerson Trotman. Even if he had wanted to share his story with us and a global audience, he has been ""rehabilitated"" as the current coach of the Barbados national team. That status could have been jeopardized by reminding everyone he was once a ""rebel."" As the regional historian Professor Hilary Beckles put it, the rebel tours still represent a ""running wound"" in West Indian society. Stephenson, King and Murray all told me they had no regrets. King was very clear that he would never say sorry for going to South Africa. Others have apologized, in the hope the controversy would be laid to rest. It will be interesting to see the reaction to our program; whether hearing a different perspective will change perceptions of the fateful decision these players made 30 years ago. And it makes you wonder, if you were ever put in their position, what would you do?","Thirty years ago, a West Indies cricket team took part in unauthorized tours .
Sporting sanctions had been placed on apartheid-era South Africa .

ff56473d2e88a02f96c9a5c0be850e59ed71af34,"(CNN) -- Microsoft is taking its last big step before releasing what promises to be a massive overhaul of its Windows operating system -- and, by extension, how almost all devices running it work. Nearing the end of a long process of tinkering under the hood, the computing giant on Friday rolled out its final preview of Windows 8, which is expected to go on sale this fall. ""Since our first preview release last September, millions of people now use the pre-release product on a daily basis and millions more have been taking it through its paces, totaling hundreds of millions of hours of testing,"" Microsoft's Steven Sinofsky wrote Friday on the Windows 8 blog. ""We genuinely appreciate the effort that so many have put into pre-release testing, and of course, we appreciate the feedback too. Direct feedback and feedback through usage contributed to hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under-the-hood changes."" The post said Microsoft has received about 18,000 comments from 7,000 early testers of Windows 8, which have contributed to ""hundreds of visible changes in the product and tens of thousands of under-the-hood changes."" The release will mark the first major update of Microsoft's operating system since Windows 7 was released three years ago. Unlike previous releases that have, essentially, revamped (or, in at least one case, mercifully killed) existing features, Microsoft is touting Windows 8 as a radical reimagining of its core product. Perhaps its most visible difference from previous versions of Windows will be its compatibility with touchscreen technology. That, combined with the system's ability to connect devices (say, a PC, a tablet and a Xbox gaming console) is what Microsoft hopes will renew the enduring Mac vs. PC war on a new front. ""In our hands-on of Microsoft's Consumer Preview, we declared that your familiar Windows desktop is all but dead,"" Alexandra Chang wrote Friday for Wired. ""In the changes we've seen in the Release Preview, this still holds true,"" she added. ""Microsoft is focused on improving and deepening the Metro [the system's design language] experience, where the desktop is only a portion -- or even an afterthought, for some users -- of a larger, app-based system."" The company has made something of a ripple with its smartphone system, at least among critics. The recently released Nokia Lumia 900 has been heralded as the best Windows phone ever, although, as of March, only about 4% of U.S. smartphones ran the company's operating system. (For what it's worth, that's a month before the Lumia was released.) But Microsoft has barely moved the needle in the tablet space, where Apple still rules the roost, and only a simpler and less expensive device like Amazon's Kindle Fire has been able to put up much resistance. Even as the final Windows 8 trial was being announced, reports were surfacing that Asus, Toshiba and Acer all plan to unveil Windows tablets next week at the Computex trade show in Taipei. Meanwhile, many in the tech world are watching and waiting. With its prowess in the computing world, it's impossible to count Microsoft out. But with Apple and Google's Android system grabbing the attention and market share in the mobile world, Microsoft appears to have an uphill battle. ""There's a long, narrow road ahead for Windows 8,"" reviewer Seth Rosenblatt wrote for CNET. ""It could be the next big thing, but there's not much room for missteps.""","Microsoft rolls out its final preview version of Windows 8 .
The operating system is a massive overhaul of Windows .

A high-spirited young falcon, Kai is the main character in ""Zambezia,"" a new South African 3D animation film featuring an all-star voice cast, including Hollywood A-listers Samuel L. Jackson, Abigail Breslin, Jeff Goldblum, Leonard Nimoy and Jeremy Suarez. Set in the majestic Victoria Falls and inspired by southern Africa's startling artwork, ""Zambezia"" is hoping to put South African animation on the map while enthralling children around the world with its uplifting message of togetherness. The movie, produced by Cape Town-based Triggerfish Animation Studios, has been selected as the closing film of the 33rd edition of the Durban International Film Festival, which runs until July 29. ""The film is a wonderful ambassador, in a way, of South Africa and I think as it travels the world it's going to spread the word about an industry that is young and vibrant and extremely talented,"" says ""Zambezia"" director and co-writer Wayne Thornley. ""In and of itself, I think it's just an enjoyable ride for children and they're going to come away wishing they could fly."" Read more: The film school in Kenya's biggest slum . The movie, which is targeted toward children aged five to 11, tells the story of Kai, an intrepid young falcon that's brought up by his strict father in an isolated outpost. His lonely life is turned upside down when a kooky bird crashes into his world and tells him of Zambezia -- a bustling bird city where ""there's amazing food, music, sights and sounds."" A talented flier, Kai decides to leave his isolated upbringing behind him and explore life in Zambezia. He quickly realizes, however, that getting by in a city can be more difficult and demanding than living alone. Yet, after joining Zambezia's air force and defending it from a band of marauding lizards, he also discovers the true values of teamwork and community sharing. Thornley says the movie was guided by the traditional African principle of ubuntu, which he describes roughly as ""a person is a person only because of other people"" -- he says that the movie's heartwarming theme will resonate with both African and international audiences. ""Everyone can relate to that idea that it's better, it's easier to do things together, that teams are just more vibrant and get more things done,"" he says. ""They are difficult and messy and it's not always easy but it is worth it -- I think that's a universal theme and I hope that audiences around the world come away with that kind of message going: it's safer to stay alone but it's not better."" Read more: Film pioneer helps Rwanda build new identity . The concept for the movie originated about seven years ago but production took just over two years to be completed. The third computer generated 3D film to be made in South Africa, ""Zambezia"" is  ""probably the biggest budget animated film ever to come out of anywhere in Africa,"" says Thornley  -- Triggerfish was unable to disclose how much the film cost, but said its budget was under $20 million. The movie's international appeal is expected to be raised by the high-profile roster of actors lending their voices to the characters. Thornley says it all became possible after well-known U.S. producer Mace Neufeld saw the film by chance. ""He liked what he saw and he finally got involved and started opening doors for us."" Read more: 'Netflix of Africa' brings Nollywood to world . Working with top Hollywood stars such as Jackson and Goldblum was ""an honor"" and ""really fun"", says Thornley. ""It was gratifying that they treated it seriously like any project,"" he says. ""We tend to think of ourselves that we're this little studio but they were fantastic and it was really a great experience,"" he adds. ""Zambezia"" had its world premiere at France's Annecy Animation Festival last month and was released in Israel earlier in July. It will hit the big screen in Germany and Switzerland on August 30, while its South Africa release is scheduled for December 26. It has already been sold in more than 30 territories for screening in over 50 countries, including a distribution deal in English-speaking territories with Sony, according to Triggerfish Animation. Thornley says South Africa's animation industry is still young and small but it is ""definitely punching above its weight."" ""I want people to sit back and have a fantastic time with the characters and have a fantastic insight into some of the amazing African landscapes that we've put into this film,"" says Thornley.

Acknowledging the uncertainty that lies ahead, President Barack Obama said Thursday that the U.S. will cooperate with Mexico in fighting drug-trafficking and organized crime in any way Mexico's government deems appropriate. He recommitted the U.S. to fighting the demand for illegal drugs and the flow of illegal guns across the border with Mexico even as the southern neighbor rethinks how much access it gives to U.S. security agencies. 'I agreed to continue our close cooperation on security, even as the nature of that cooperation will evolve,' Obama said at a joint news conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. 'It is obviously up to the Mexican people to determine their security structures and how it engages with other nations — including the United States.'

Shaking hands: U.S. President Barack Obama (right) and his Mexican counterpart Enrique Pena Nieto shake hands as the president arrives in Mexico City . Obama's remarks come as Pina Nieto, in . a dramatic shift from his predecessor, has moved to end the widespread . access that U.S. security agencies have had in Mexico to help fight . drug-trafficking and organized crime. The White House has been cautious . in its public response to the changes, with the president and his . advisers saying they need to hear directly from the Mexican leader . before making a judgment about the new arrangement. Pina Nieto, speaking at the news . conference in Spanish, downplayed the notion that the new arrangement . would mean less close cooperation with the United States. 'There is no . clash between these two goals,' he said. He said Obama had said the U.S. will 'cooperate on the basis of mutual respect' to promote an efficient security strategy. The two leaders met Thursday at Mexico's National Palace on the first day of Obama's three-day trip to Mexico and Costa Rica. To sell his immigration overhaul back . home, Obama needs a growing economy in Mexico and a Mexican president . willing to help him secure the border. He arrived in Mexico City eager to promote Mexico's economic success and the neighboring country's . place as the second largest export market for U.S. goods and services. Mexicans will be hanging on the American president's words, but Obama also has in mind an important audience back in the United States. Though the role played by Latino voters in last year's U.S. presidential election gets much credit for the current momentum for potentially changing immigration laws and providing a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally, another reason for the change in attitudes is that stronger border protections and the recession have been disincentives to cross into the U.S. Tour: President Barack Obama (L) gets a tour of the National Palace in Mexico City from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto (right) Meeting: US President Barack Obama (L) and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto make their way to their seats for a bilateral meeting . Cruising: The presidential limousine with President Barack Obama inside drives past the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City's main plaza, the Zocalo . As a result, illegal immigration has declined. 'With Mexico, first and foremost, . they are critical to our ability to secure the border,' said Ben Rhodes, . an Obama deputy national security adviser. 'All . the immigration plans that have been contemplated put a focus on . securing the border as an essential priority and starting point for . immigration reform.' Even better than a strong border is an economy that keeps people from fleeing. 'If . the Mexican economy is growing, it forestalls the need for people to . migrate to the United States to find work,' Rhodes added. Eager to focus on the economy and immigration, the administration is downplaying Pena Nieto's recent steps to end the broad access Mexico gave U.S. security agencies to help fight drug trafficking and organized crime under his predecessor, Felipe Calderon. Still, the changes are likely to be a subject during the two leaders' private talks. Pena Nieto took office in December, and for Obama the trip is an opportunity to take his measure of the Mexican leader early in his tenure. 'It's really important to go there . while this new president is forming his own plans and judgments about . what he's going to do about the border, about where he's going to be on . immigration, about where he is on trade,' U.S. Chamber of Commerce . President/CEO Thomas Donohue said in an interview. The . chamber long has worked to improve U.S.-Mexico trade, noting that now . about 6 million U.S. jobs depend on commerce with Mexico. Drugs: A Mexican federal police officer stands next to packages, believed to be marijuana. The administration is downplaying Pena Nieto's recent steps to end the broad access Mexico gave U.S. security agencies to help fight drug trafficking . Striking the right note on border security is key, Donohue said, because it is a central to winning support in Congress for the rest of the immigration legislation. 'That's what everybody wants to hear, and we have to do that in a way that makes these guys down there feel like we're doing it in conjunction with them and for them, so we can do this thing on immigration well, so we can expand our trade, so we can deal with our political issues as they are trying to deal with theirs,' Donohue said. Still, with 33 million U.S. residents of Mexican origin, Obama's message in Mexico is also bound to resonate in the U.S., where Latinos could increase pressure on Congress to act. 'It helps keep these passions alive as far as an issue to promote for the administration,' said Carl Meacham, a former senior Latin America adviser on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But Meacham, now director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cautioned that despite some bipartisan support to create a path to citizenship in the immigration bill, there is skepticism in Latin America. 'They've been brought to the altar so many times by different American administrations that there's a little bit of a lack of trust,' he said. For Pena Nieto, Obama's visit is a chance for him to showcase his country's economic gains. After suffering along with the U.S. during the recession, its economy is now growing at a better clip than that of the U.S. Per capita income has gone from an annual $7,900 two years ago to $10,146.","Obama needs growing economy in Mexico to sell immigration overhaul .

The footage was taken in November 2012 just before Jessica Linscott and her boyfriend Roland Dow left her son at a hospital and fled to Florida. The 25-year-old, who is already in prison for child endangerment charges and witness tampering, testified against Dow who is on trial for allegedly beating and burning her son. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Jessica Linscott cried in court on Thursday as she testified that Roland Dow struck her son in the head when he had a seizure . Trial: Roland Dow, pictured in court Thursday, is accused of severely beating and burning his girlfriend's son . She told the court she witnessed Dow strike her son in the head when he had seizures, and admitted that she didn't comfort her son. Linscott claimed in court that Dow physically and mentally abused her, and treated her son 'worse than a dog you don't want'. 'I allowed . a lot of things to happen that I shouldn't have let happen. I was being . a horrific parent,' she said. 'I was neglecting my son's needs. I was . putting Roland first and letting him take control of every situation.' The mother claimed her boyfriend hated her child, and punished him at the slightest provocation. If her son soiled his clothes, Dow would make him go in the shower to rinse off, . holding him down and spraying him with water. Sometimes, the frantic . toddler fell in the tub and got hurt as he struggled, she said. 'No . matter what my son was doing, he was doing it wrong [in Dow's eyes],' she said. 'My son . couldn't color the right way, he couldn't eat the right way, he . couldn't talk the right way.' Threat: Linscott, who is serving a sentence for child endangerment, says her boyfriend had physically abused her and her child . Abuse: The three-year-old boy was treated in hospital for burns and a brain injury . On the run: Dow and Linscott were arrested at a Florida theme park two weeks after leaving Linscott's son at a hospital and fleeing . Linscott said she let Dow abuse and terrify James in part because she feared he would do something even worse if she left him. Linscott, who is serving a two and a half to seven-year prison sentence, told the court she had filmed her son so she could show doctors his behavior. She claimed she believed he was having 'autistic fits' on purpose, and worried there was something seriously wrong with him. In one video, which was filmed just a few days before her son was taken to hospital, he is seen stumbling and complaining that he had a 'tummy ache'. Later, he was seen in the video cowering in a bathtub while being yelled at to stop having seizures. In other videos, the three-year-old appeared stiff and unresponsive as he was sat on the toilet, or put in the bathtub. Coached: In one video, not pictured, the child was filmed as Dow taught him what to say to social workers . Witness: Linscott testified against her boyfriend Dow, who is facing charges of assaulting her son . Arrest: The couple were arrested and charged over the alleged abuse suffered by Linscott's young son . The jury was also shown a video of the couple preparing James for a social worker's . visit in 2012. The video, which Linscott said Dow shot from . under a couch, doesn't clearly show the couple or the boy, but their . voices could be heard. Dow . is heard asking James, 'Do you like being here?', 'Anybody ever spank . you?', and 'Ever go in the shower when you're really bad?'. The little boy can be heard answering softly, 'yeah,' 'no' and 'no.' When he was asked: 'If someone said I hit you, are they lying?' Dow answered himself with a stern 'Yes'. Dow then could be heard saying to the boy: 'Hey, give me a hug. We're best friends, right?' The . couple fled to Florida after leaving the toddler at a hospital in . November 2012. They were arrested at a theme park two weeks later. During their absence, Linscott's son had been treated for a brain injury and burns on his wrist and fingers. The boy was 'beaten to the point where . he almost lost his life,' according to Massachusetts Live, which saw a court motion filed by . Rockingham County Assistant District Attorney Patricia Conway. The . child, who is now five years old, is now being cared for by Linscott's . mother. His father had died of a drug overdose before the alleged abuse . began.

ff58785fad3e69d85c09653115766a361d44cbe2,"Editor's note: Nell Minow is editor and chairwoman of the Corporate Library, an independent research company, and was named one of the 20 most influential people in corporate governance by Directorship magazine and ""the queen of good corporate governance"" by BusinessWeek Online. She has co-written three books. Nell Minow says AIG's board must be held accountable for the $160 million in bonus payments. (CNN) -- The stories about the outrageous $160 million bonus payments at AIG have all omitted the most important names. They are the members of AIG's Board of Directors Compensation Committee. These people should have been on the hot seat before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises, alongside CEO Ed Liddy. Although there is a lot of blame to go around, ultimately the buck stops -- or, I should say, the bucks should have stopped -- with them. Why haven't we learned that it is the boards who are responsible for the massive failures of strategy and risk management at these companies? Regulators, journalists, securities analysts and investors routinely ignore the most obvious indicators of investment risk that are presented by bad boards of directors. This is particularly obvious in the case of AIG, which has been a serial offender in corporate governance, especially in executive compensation. Those of us who remember former CEO Hank Greenberg's departure from AIG in 2005, after a corporate governance meltdown that included excessive compensation, appreciate the irony of his comment to ABC News that the retention bonuses were ""mind-boggling."" Mr. Kettle, Pot is on line 1. Compensation committees are not responsible for individual pay packages below the CEO, but they are responsible for determining their overall structure -- and for making sure that the CEO's job includes effective management on compensation issues. Retention of employees may be a legitimate goal of a compensation program, but it can be accomplished in a way that is both effective and credible by being tied to performance goals and by delaying vesting until after the bailout funds are returned to taxpayers. The Corporate Library released a report in February about the boards of the bailout companies, many of which were outliers in their governance and compensation practices. Some of these were clear indicators of investment and liability risk. In several cases, we found individuals who not only sat on more than four corporate boards but also sat on more than one of these particularly troubled boards during this period. Former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, for example, served on the boards of Morgan Stanley, General Motors and Wachovia -- and at various times was also a director at Merck, VF Corp., Krispy Kreme and Cousins Properties. Several other directors from these troubled boards also sat on either five or six boards altogether. We call the phenomenon of directors who serve on four or more corporate boards ""overboarding."" Overboarding can limit the time and attention a director has for each board. It can also be an indicator of -- or a contributor to -- so many relationships and connections that it makes it more difficult to provide the respectful skepticism necessary for independent oversight. In all, 11 of the 27 companies we identified as ""troubled"" had at least one overboarded director. Six had more than one; at Merrill Lynch, there were five. By comparison, fewer than 30 percent of S&P 500 companies have even a single overboarded director, and fewer than 5 percent have more than one. Another key finding from our analysis: Shareholders at these companies were well aware of the relative weakness of these boards and had expressed their dissatisfaction by withholding votes from many of these individuals the year before these companies collapsed. At least 13 individual directors, all of whom sat on at least three corporate boards during this period, had received a 13 percent or higher negative vote. The highest of these was a 38.58 percent negative vote received by Sir Winfried F.W. Bischoff at McGraw-Hill, where he sat on the compensation committee. Bischoff also served on the boards at Citigroup (as chairman and interim CEO), Eli Lilly and Prudential. Although the businesses of these companies do not overlap enough to impair Bischoff's designation as an ""independent"" director or to create legal conflict of interest concerns, it is relevant that McGraw-Hill owns ratings agency Standard & Poor's, which not only rates the other companies for which he was a director but also issues ratings on which the other companies rely in their assessment of risk. Because of the extensive involvement that financial services companies have in many different aspects of the business of large public corporations, directors of those companies in particular should be especially cautious about overlaps and conflicts. Badly designed compensation is an indicator of poor corporate governance, and poor corporate governance is an indicator of investment risk. Instead of trying to tax the bonuses at AIG, the government and the shareholders should insist on new directors. The company's Web site says the compensation committee has five members. The two longest serving ones are James F. Orr III, who joined the committee on May 17, 2006 and Virginia M. Rometty, who joined it on January 17, 2007, according to the company's 2007 proxy statement. The committee's charter says its responsibility include making recommendations to the full board regarding AIG's compensation programs and reviewing and approving any hiring, severance or termination payments. People say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting a different result. In this case, insanity is allowing the same people to continue to serve on the board after massive failure and expecting them to produce a different result. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nell Minow.","Nell Minow: People often overlook crucial role of company board of directors .

In a landmark ruling, the Roman Catholic Church faces having to pay millions to sex abuse victims after the court ruled it could be liable for priests' crimes. The woman claims she was assaulted by Father Wilfred Baldwin during two years at The Firs, in . Waterlooville, Hampshire, which has now closed, after being sent there . with her three siblings. She . said the priest would sexually assault her as ‘punishment’ for misbehaviour, . adding: ‘The nuns knew. He was allowed to take any child and rape them. It was always my fault. He would even make me give money afterwards, . tuppence in the poor box. He said God had told him to do it.’ Ruling: The decision by the High Court could have far-reaching implications for the church. It is subject to appeal . The woman known as JGE  was at the Firs children's home for two years from age six to eight between May 1970 and May 1972. The following are among the claims she has made: . JGE, . as she was referred to in court, never spoke of what happened until she . was contacted by police investigating abuse allegations at the home. ‘I didn’t tell anyone,’ she said, ‘even one of my siblings who I found out later had also been sexually assaulted.’ In . the landmark ruling, Mr Justice MacDuff said the Church can be held . responsible for the sins of its clergy because of the ‘immense power’ it . gave them. His judgment could lead to thousands of claims by people in England and Wales who say they were sexually abused by priests, perhaps decades earlier. It also means the Church may be held to account for other criminal acts by priests. In the test case yesterday, Mr Justice MacDuff found that the behaviour of Father Baldwin, who died in 2006. was the Church’s responsibility. The decision means the victim can sue the Bishop of Portsmouth, Crispian Hollis. The Church told the court it should not be answerable for wrongdoing by Father Baldwin because it did not employ him. Lawyers for the Portsmouth Roman Catholic Diocesan Trust, led by Lord Faulks QC, said priests were not paid by the diocese, nor could they be disciplined or sacked by the bishop. They lived on money from the collection plate and a priest could not even be made to change his job without  agreeing. But Mr Justice MacDuff said: ‘Father Baldwin was appointed by and on behalf of the defendants. ‘He was provided with the premises, the pulpit and the clerical robes. 'He was directed into the community with that full authority and was given free rein to act as a representative of the Church. 'He had been trained and ordained for that purpose. He had immense power handed to him by the defendants. 'It was their empowerment of the priest which materially increased the risk of sexual assault, the granting of the power to exploit and misuse the trust which the defendants had granted to him.’ The diocese refused to comment but is expected to appeal. Anne Lawrence, of the victim support group Minister and Clergy Sexual Abuse Survivors, said she was relieved by the ruling, adding: ‘We hope it opens the way for the settlement of many hundreds of cases pending in courts.’ The Church has been trying for a decade to end scandals over sexual abuse by priests, and is set to publish a report today on abuse at a school in Ealing, West London.","Case could have wide-reaching implications for alleged church child abuse victims .

Luis Plascencia, 47, sent the barrage of hate-filled messages through Facebook and e-mail to Kourtney Reppert, it is alleged. The 26-year-old Playboy hostess was so terrified she hired security guards for her birthday party at a nightclub in April. Plascencia was arrested at his home in Chicago and held without a bond. He will appear in court today to face the charges which carry a maximum of five years in prison. Threats: Lingerie model Kourtney Reppert, 26, allegedly received a barrage of disturbing emails and Facebook messages from Luis Plascencia . One message is claimed ho have said: 'I hope you die in an automobile accident and [it] crushes your ugly face through the windshield and a large piece of glass cuts your throat.' Plascencia is alleged to have later used a computer at the Chicago Public Library to send  emails threatening to cut Reppert's head off and chop her parents 'to pieces with a hand saw'  unless she stopped modelling. The FBI affidavit states that Plascencia lived with his mother and sent messages using a number of different email addresses, according to LA Weekly. He was apparently angry that the model was posing semi-nude, in lingerie and bikinis. But in one instance Plascencia is alleged to have impersonated a photographer in an attempt to get Miss Reppert to pose nude for him. Another alleged message added: 'I'm going to stab you in the f*****g heart and cut your head off'. He is also said to have branded her a 'slut', a 'whore', a 'gutless b***h' and a 'fat ass'. The charges claim that Plascencia also sent Miss Reppert a CD containing 234 photographs of her that he had collected. Fearful: The model was so terrified by the emails that she had to hire bodyguards and even security for her birthday party, police files claim . The suspected stalker is said to have threatened to cut off the head of the Playboy hostess, pictured here in a blue bikini . According to detectives, Plascencia posted letters to Reppert's former address, and those of her father and stepmother. Another email excerpted in the criminal complaint stated: 'I warned you before about doing this and will continue my wrath until you step down as a model go back to college and move back near your family in Philly. I know where you are most of the time.' Reppert told authorities she was so disturbed by the messages that she hired bodyguards to go out with her in public. Security guards were also used to protect her birthday party in April at a nightclub. The model claimed that a private detective she employed confronted Plascencia about the suspected stalking. He is said to have apologised before deleting files on his computer. But when police raided his apartment they are said to have found CDs containing images of the Miss Reppert set to music. Alias: Plascencia is alleged to have sent some of the messages from Chicago Public Library, pictured, using different email addresses . Reppert tweeted that she initially declined to speak publicly about the allegations and was 'disappointed' her identity had been revealed through the FBI files. 'This has been a very stressful time for me and my family,' Reppert wrote on Facebook yesterday. 'I will remain positive.' The glamour model moved from Philadelphia to LA last year and has since worked as a hostess at the Playboy mansion. Philladelphia radio hosts Steve Morrison and Preston Elliot also rated her the state's 'hottest blonde' on their 'Preston and Steve' show  on 93.3 WMMR.

The crane operator accused of being high on marijuana when a Philadelphia building collapsed on to a thrift store, killing six people, has turned himself into police. Sean Benschop was wanted on six counts of involuntary manslaughter, 13 counts of recklessly endangering another person and one count of risking a catastrophe. Authorities believe the 42-year-old had been using an excavator on Wednesday when the remains of the four-storey building gave way, killing two employees and four customers, and injuring 13 others. Wanted: Sean Benschop covers his face with a red jacket as he turns himself in to Philadelphia police . Deputy Mayor Everett Gillison told The Associated Press a toxicology report showed evidence that Mr Benschop was high on marijuana. That finding, combined with witness statements and evidence led to the decision on Friday to raid his north Philadelphia home, he said. Mr Benschop had samples of his . blood and urine tested at a hospital about two hours after part of the . building on Market Street crumbled on to the Salvation Army thrift store . below on Wednesday morning. Sources also told CBS Philadelphia that police officers noticed Mr Benschop was speaking in an unusually slow and quiet manner, as if he were whispering. The . 42-year-old crane operator allegedly told investigators that he has . been taking prescription pain medications after suffering a cut to his . finger recently. Mr Benschop, who also goes by the name Kary Roberts, has been arrested at least 11 times since 1994 on charges ranging from drugs to theft to weapons possession, according to court records. He was twice sentenced to prison in the 1990s after being convicted on drug trafficking charges. At least two survivors have sued the demolition contractor and building owner, alleging gross recklessness at the job site. The city has since promised to improve the demolition industry. Under the influence: Sean Benschop, 42, allegedly tested positive for illegal drugs and prescription narcotics two hours after the building collapse . Boss sued: Demolition contractor Griffin Campbell is facing a lawsuit in connection to the collapse of the Philadelphia building . 'We can do much better,' Mayor Michael Nutter said. 'We will not accept the status quo in the face of this tragedy.' Mr Nutter's reform for construction sites includes random drug testing on heavy equipment operators. The . mayor also pledged to adopt tougher background requirements for . demolition contractors, including information about each worker's . experience, and frequent site inspections. His plan could run into resistance from builders who say they are already highly regulated. 'I . think that before we do anything, before we rush to any judgment about . how to fix what happened, we have to have all the facts,"" Steven Lakin, . of the General Building Contractors Association, which represents . Philadelphia contractors, said. 'Everybody wants to regulate demolition contractors, but I'm not so sure that's the answer.'

Bell, a 50-year-old mother of three, was shopping at the thrift store . when the building came down . She fell into the basement and was covered . by rubble for more than an hour. 'She's still shook up real bad, sore, swollen up,' Ms Bell's brother, Keith, said. He added that his sister was suffering after 'seeing other people getting killed'. Construction engineers said the thrift store should have been evacuated during the demolition project taking place next to it.

In an interview about the case with 48 Hours, jury consultant Lee Meihls revealed the specific personality types she looked for, and how their pop culture tastes were an important part of evaluating their personalities. Meihls said it was important for the defense to find someone who 'it doesn't matter what you say, they're going to start challenging you.' Jury expert Lee Meihls said a person's viewing habits reflected on the kind of juror they'd be . Jurors believed Kelly Soo Park's DNA may have found it's way to the crime scene without her being there . In the case of Kelly Soo Park, they needed quite a few skeptics. Beauty: Juliana Redding was murdered in her Santa Monica apartment in 2008 and DNA from a woman who prosecutors then alleged worked for her ex-boyfriend Dr. Uwaydah was found all over her home and on her neck . Police had discovered her DNA all over the house one-time Maxim model and actress Juliana Redding was killed in, with traces even visible on her throat. Redding was found strangled to death . in her apartment in March 2008, the investigation eventually turned into . a cold case. Park was accused of working as an . enforcer for a Dr Munir Uwaydah, a physician who once dated Miss . Redding. Uwaydah had lavished expensive gifts and trips on Redding and invited her to live in his mansion before she discovered he had a wife and child. She broke off contact, but Uwaydah continued to try and woo her and attempted to establish business deals with her father to keep in contact. 'For most . people, DNA is DNA, and it tells the truth,' Meihls said. 'So we had to . have another story about the DNA. I felt our side of the story made . more sense.'

ff5acee75e68e77b9ad9e66e3d0807ccf918259f,"(CNN) -- It seems North Korea's new leader Kim Jong Un is carrying on his father's strange tradition: mixing a fascination with American culture with a hatred of the United States. Kim has made it quite clear that his country's February nuclear test marks a new phase of confrontation with the United States, which Pyongyang has described as ""the sworn enemy of the Korean people."" Opinion: How to deal with North Korea . Yet that hasn't stopped Pyongyang from welcoming a few dignitaries from this ""sworn enemy"" nation, including a top Google executive and a few basketball stars. No one knows if it's all part of an organized effort to woo North Korea into diplomacy by appealing to its leader's interest in American culture. Yet one thing is for sure: This love-hate relationship has sparked some odd stories out of the Hermit Kingdom. Here's a look at some of the most recent ones we've come across: . 1. Kim Jong Un: Dennis Rodman's new BFF . If you read the reports about former NBA star Dennis Rodman's visit to Pyongyang, you might have double-checked whether the story was just another Onion parody. Not only did the American basketball star -- known for his over-the-top publicity stunts -- visit North Korea, but he also was joined by three members of the famed Harlem Globetrotters, who played against North Korea's ""Dream Team"" (no surprise, the game ended in a tie). Rodman proclaimed Kim ""a friend for life,"" and appeared courtside with the North Korean leader. Not everyone was cheering this so-called ""basketball diplomacy."" A commentary in Canada's National Post outlined North Korea's ""monstrous gulag system that Dennis Rodman will never see."" And CNN contributor John Avlon wrote that Rodman isn't the only ""celebrity to be used for publicity purposes to prop up a dictator."" North Korea issues threat to U.S. military . 2. Google executive urges country with barely any electricity to embrace the Internet . You've probably seen that NASA satellite photo of the Korean peninsula at night, the one that shows the northern half completely dark while the southern half and the Chinese coast are fully alight. Electricity is still a luxury in North Korea, where cold winds from nearby Siberia can plunge temperatures below freezing. But that didn't stop Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt from visiting North Korea in January as part of a delegation urging North Korea to ""make it possible for people to use the Internet."" While many North Koreans might be more interested in having a heated home, Schmidt and his Google colleague Jared Cohen have advocated about the Internet's ability to empower citizens living under oppressive regimes. 3. Famous Americans apparently aren't the only ones heading to Pyongyang . In the wake of the Schmidt and Rodman visits, Bloomberg Businessweek looked at just how many Westerners are heading to North Korea for its closely monitored, government-run tours. Surprisingly, it found a nearly 20% increase in visits since 2011. 4. Get your North Korean education ... in Tokyo . The United States isn't the only outside country that has a love-hate relationship with North Korea. Until the end of World War II, Korea was a Japanese colony, and many Koreans were brought to Japan -- many against their will -- before Korea was divided between north and south. More recently, North Korea admitted to kidnapping Japanese citizens from Japanese soil in the 1970s and 1980s, something Tokyo has demanded more answers about. Despite this tense history, Japan hosts a number of North Korean-funded schools -- complete with portraits of North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung and previous leader Kim Jong Il on its walls. Students, who are mostly Japanese, say they are learning Korean culture and language, and laugh off suggestions that they're training to be spies. 5. Dreaming of annihilating the United States, to the tune of 'We Are The World' It's no secret that North Korea's propaganda images are bizarre, at least to the non-North Korean eye. If this doesn't make sense, just search Google Images for ""North Korea propaganda."" Yet one video released in the run-up to North Korea's nuclear test on Pyongyang's official website still managed to raise some eyebrows. The video -- set to the tune of ""We Are The World,"" the 1985 song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie heralding world peace -- shows a North Korean man dreaming about an apparent missile attack on the United States. ""Black smoke was billowing somewhere in America,"" the caption in Korean reads. Seven ways to get serious with North Korea .","North Korea has declared the United States a ""sworn enemy""
But recently, American dignitaries have been welcomed in Pyongyang .
North Korea recently carried out a nuclear test that it called a new phase of confrontation ."

But the rising senior at Philadelphia's Temple University had to travel a long and difficult road to get to where she is today. Roberts was taken away from her parents when she was 7 years old. She still remembers vividly the day that long journey began, when a woman she had never seen before and hasn't seen since came in a car to get her and her brother Shawn, who was 3 or 4 years old. ""It was pretty scary for me,"" Roberts said. ""My brother and I were in the back with a bag full of both of our belongings. My biological mother got out of the car and the lady kept driving, and she drove to someone else's house and she told us we'd be staying there, and she left. And so nobody really explained to me what foster care was, or what being taken away from your parents meant, or how long it would be for or why it happened."" Roberts spent five years in foster care in Camden, New Jersey, shuttling from one family to the next. During that time, Roberts said, she suffered sexual abuse and her brother suffered emotional abuse. ""If it wasn't me being abused then it was me seeing my brother being abused, which was more difficult for me,"" she said. ""I felt strong enough to endure the abuse as long as my brother didn't have to go through it, and so I would always try to be there, like after school. I would try to make sure I got home and was just there with my brother to make sure he was OK."" She was eventually removed from that situation and ended up with Lisa Roberts, who later adopted her, adding to a growing family of adopted children. But during the process she and her brother were separated. Marchelle hasn't seen Shawn in 12 years. CNN Heroes: Breaking down barriers so foster kids can find families . Now she is one of 15 former foster children participating in the Foster Youth Internship program run by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. The program aims to give former foster children an opportunity to help shape public policy on child welfare issues. Interns spend the summer working in the offices of members of Congress from both parties. At the end of the program, they make a presentation to the entire Congress with recommendations on how to improve the foster care system. The interns live in a college dormitory and have weekly dinners to talk about their experiences on the Hill and growing up in the system. They also get a stipend for a business wardrobe and informal career counseling from the Sara Start Fund for Foster Youth, an organization that works with CCAI to help them get a start on their professional lives. The program is competitive, about 250 young people apply each year and applicants must have completed at least one semester of college. CCAI Executive Director Kathleen Strottman said the young people who are accepted are the cream of the crop. Former interns have gone on to clerkships and to various positions in state government. Nearly half have entered careers in social service. ""We find that the youth who have survived foster care are, by their nature, more problem solvers,"" Strottman said. ""So what better people to bring to bear on a problem that really needs to be solved?"" Pushing for change . Roberts survived that system and says there's a lot she wants to see changed. She wants to create a one-stop online clearinghouse laying out the resources available to foster youth and former foster youth all across the country, and she wants states to do more to keep siblings together in foster care. ""It's not just keeping them together, but making sure that they're in stable environments,"" she said. ""In the system, youth are taken away from -- most of the times -- their biological parents because they're suffering from some kind abuse or something like that, and so I don't think that being placed into a home where you suffer the same things solves much."" She has been interning in the office of Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, who had her own encounter with an orphan at a young age and has been an advocate for foster children and orphans since she was first elected to office. ""When I was a child, a young teenager, I literally found a little 9-year-old sleeping in a park and it was just horrifying to me that a child would be alone sleeping anywhere, let alone sleeping in a park,"" Landrieu said during an interview in her Capitol Hill office. ""I brought him home and that was my beginning of understanding about a child that was homeless, living with a grandmother incapable of raising him. And then, of course, he went through the foster care system, and that's when I learned how broken it was."" Landrieu, who helped create the internship program 10 years ago, said a tax credit to help families adopt and a program that helps provide education, and training vouchers to foster youth as they transition out of the system, have helped, but more needs to be done to improve the system. ""The foster care interns that come to Washington learn a lot about the system here and how it affects their lives and the lives of children in foster care all over America, which are about 500,000,"" Landrieu said. ""But most importantly, it educates members of Congress and their staffs about what really happens in our foster care system, and we think out of this great changes for the better will occur."" Roberts is still searching for her younger brother, who she believes would be 17 or 18 years old now. ""I worry constantly,"" she said. ""I was able to be adopted and I had a lovely life and all these siblings that love me, I have a mom who loves me, you know I'm just living a great life right now. And I don't know if his situation was as blessed as mine was. ""And then there's also -- he could have been bouncing around from foster home to foster home and I wasn't. He could have been adopted and it's possible his adoptive family didn't want him to have contact with his biological family, and I think about those things all the time."" When she graduates in the winter, Roberts plans to pursue a career in broadcast journalism -- a field she loves and that she hopes might one day help Shawn find her. For now, she feels fortunate to have had what she calls a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spend a summer in the halls of Congress and to share her story. ""There are so many things I want people to know,"" she said. ""One of the main things that I want people to know is that foster youth count.""","Marchelle Roberts was taken away from her parents when she was 7 .

'I am an out, proud, and happy gay man': Ty Herndon has come out as gay in an interview with Entertainment Tonight . When asked by Nischelle Turner what the biggest lie he has told himself is, in reference to his hit song, the singer said: ‘That I couldn't be gay and be in country music. ‘I've dreamed about being in country music since I was six years old and it's my life, it’s what I do, it's who I am and I went to great lengths to cover up that fact to be a country star.

ff5d903525fdc86d40601f65594df5afadc4710d,"When it comes to finding a doctor, chances are you spend a lot more time worrying about your man, your kids, or your parents than yourself. After all, you're strong enough to soldier through the occasional cold, right? If this sounds like you, you're not alone: In a recent survey, nearly a third of Americans who don't have a primary care physician (PCP) said they didn't think they needed one. The truth is, we all do. Not only do people with a regular doc receive better overall care, but it's easier for them to get an appointment on short notice -- helpful for reassurance on day-to-day health queries, and especially crucial if you should ever find yourself in a serious health crisis. ""Finding a doctor before you get sick is especially important now that more insurance plans are requiring that PCPs serve as gatekeepers for our medical needs,"" says Trisha Torrey, author of ""You Bet Your Life: The Ten Mistakes Every Patient Makes"". Your mission: To locate an M.D. with great experience; an organized, friendly office staff; and, most of all, the ability to collaborate well with you (it is, after all, your body and health). Here's how. Health.com: Secrets women keep from their doctors . Step 1: Go to your network . Your social network, that is. Start by asking your friends and family (and any doctors you have and like) for the names of their favorite docs. This method may seem unscientific, but in one recent survey, doctors ranked getting a recommendation from family or friends as the most valuable way for you to choose a good physician. Consider also checking an online doctor-rating site, like vitals.com or zocdoc.com. Just keep in mind that opinions from others may be a good gauge of a doctor's bedside manner (which is indeed important), but not necessarily a way to measure her medical ability. ""Friends who have had only annual checkups don't have as good a sense of their doctors' medical competence, so see if you can ask someone who's had health trouble,"" Torrey says. ""If they felt well-served by the doctor, that's a better bet."" That was true for Abby Gardner, 36, a New York City website editor: ""Recently, I noticed a spot on my chest. My friend suggested I see her doctor, Dr. Henry Lee."" Lee had found a melanoma on Gardner's friend's roommate, who raved about his care and professionalism. ""He not only checked the spot, but also found a mole on my thigh that turned out to be a melanoma,"" she says. ""I was so glad to have a thorough doctor who caught it early."" If your friends don't give you any good leads, contact your nearest academic medical center (a hospital linked to a medical school, also known as a teaching hospital) and ask for a referral. ""Those centers are usually highly rated,"" says Lisa Rubenstein, M.D., director of the VA/UCLA/RAND Center for the Study of Healthcare Provider Behavior. Health.com: What to do when you disagree with your doctor . Step 2: Check out her credentials . There's no need to limit yourself to doctors who graduated from the fanciest medical school around. What matters more, says Rubenstein: ""the hospital where they did their residency, and where they practice."" Two reasons why: A residency is where physicians get their on-the-job training, and the other M.D.'s they practice with seem to affect their clinical style more than where they went to school. Look for a doctor who is board-certified and affiliated with a reputable hospital (your insurance company's website will generally list credentials and affiliations), since, if you ever wind up being hospitalized, this will likely be the place you'll go. ""Academic hospitals generally do better in terms of safety and patient outcomes than unaffiliated community hospitals,"" says Rubenstein. Hospitalcompare.hhs.gov can help you assess the quality of hospitals in your area. Health.com: Want to skip the doctor? Try this . Step 3: Vet the office . You can find out some key details about a prospective doctor just by calling her. Start with how you're greeted. If the receptionist treats you poorly, it may be a sign that the practice isn't respectful of patients in general, says Torrey. If the doctor and her staff are nice and professional, on the other hand, you will know that she runs a practice where patients are treated with respect. Health.com: How to have a great doctor-patient relationship . Step 4: Size her up in person . Once you're finally face-to-face with the M.D., do a gut check. Do you feel comfortable? Your health will benefit if you do: A recent study in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine found that patients who had empathetic, engaged physicians felt more supported and were better able to take charge of their own well-being. Last year, Brenda Avadian, of Los Angeles, went in search of a new primary care doctor because her last one was dismissive of her complaints of exhaustion. She vetted a prospective doc online, then set up an appointment. ""After an hour, I decided to switch to him,"" says Avadian, 52, who works in the caregiving industry. ""He really took time to listen to me."" Her new doctor ordered a complete blood panel, and within a couple of days, Avadian had a diagnosis: Her thyroid was sluggish. ""The problem could have gotten worse,"" she says. ""It worked out because I found a doctor who really listens."" You may not get an hour with your prospective PCP the way Avadian did, but all you need is a few minutes to tell if she's up to snuff. Rubenstein recommends that you bring three questions about your health issues, big or small, to your first appointment. As the doctor answers your queries, think to yourself: Does she explain things well? Does she consult with me and give me time to ask follow-up questions? A doctor who does these things -- and makes you feel comfortable -- just might be your perfect match.","Nearly a third of Americans who don't have a PCP said they didn't think they needed one .

But authorities believe he died of his injuries during the boat journey, said Rod Antone of the Mayor's Office of the County of Maui. The man was in his 40s, but authorities are unsure if he was a local resident or a tourist, Antone said. The identities of the man and his companion have not been disclosed.

Four people have after died eating cantaloupe melons which were carrying the deadly listeria bacteria, officials have said. More fatalities are feared after two more deaths were linked to the batch of infected fruits. So far there are confirmed deaths in Colorado, one in Oklahoma and two in New Mexico. Deadly: While millions enjoy the melons, a batch from Jensen Farms in Holly, Colorado is suspected to be infected with listeria which has killed four people . The illnesses have been traced to fruit from Jensen Farms in Holly, Colorado, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had found listeria in samples of Jensen Farms' cantaloupe taken from a Denver store. Samples taken from equipment and cantaloupe at the farm's packing facility also confirmed a match to the strain of the disease. Listeria is often found in soil, plants, and food and it is fairly rare for people to die from infections. Pasteurisation and cooking is normally enough to kill Listeria and it’s often the elderly who die because they are not strong enough to fight infection. It is also dangerous to pregnant women because it easily passes through to the foetus. Symptoms of listeria include fever and muscle aches, often with other gastrointestinal symptoms. Officials say 35 people in 10 states have been suffered in the outbreak so far in California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and West Virginia. Bacteria: Listeria can spread from soil and rivers and generally kills elderly people who don't have strong immune systems . Colorado has been the most affected with 12 cases, followed by Oklahoma with six and New Mexico with five. Anyone who has bought one of the suspected contaminated cantaloupes is being advised to throw it out immediately. About 800 cases of listeria are found in the United States each year, according to CDC, and there usually are three or four outbreaks. Most of these are traced to deli meat and soft cheeses, where listeria is most common. Produce has rarely been the culprit, but federal investigators say they have seen more produce-related listeria illnesses in the last two years. It was found in sprouts in 2009 and celery in 2010.","Infection linked to batch of fruit from farm in Holly, Colorado ."
ff5de6b52e36cb443f4ee927e6f589ec11a0e075,"Jason Britcher, 40, pictured outside of court was alleged to have attempted to rape a woman barrister at a Christmas party . A barristers' legal clerk attempted to rape a junior woman lawyer after a solicitors' Christmas party, a court heard. Married Jason Britcher, 40, crept in to the sleeping woman's hotel room after texting her at 3am to ask where she was. The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was not initially alarmed and mistook the father-of-one for her husband. As she began to wake up she discovered that it was Britcher and she was assaulted twice, Hull Crown Court heard. Britcher later claimed he had stumbled into her room through an interconnecting hotel door, as he was looking for the bathroom. He said the woman consented to what went on. A second woman has also complained that she too had been assaulted by Britcher, but  five years earlier than the attack on the barrister. Britcher, who has a teenage daughter, denied to one charge of rape, two charges of sexual assault and one charge of attempted rape, on two separate women. In the more recent incident the jury was told the pair had gone independently to the party for solicitors and barristers in the south  of the country. 'It was a typical Christmas party in which people would drink, dance and socialize,' said Mr Thackray. He explained the victim booked a room at a nearby hotel because she did not live locally. Britcher had the room next door. He sent her a text at 3.44am saying: 'Sorting a little room. Are you guys in main building, or pleb X.' She did not reply. He sent her room-mate a text offering his bed while he slept on the floor. Neither woman replied. 'You may wonder what was going through his mind at this time. Was he about to crash out and fall asleep or was he wanting some company?' said Mr Thackray. 'There was no intimacy between them whatsoever, nor had there been any intimacy between them on a prior occasion. 'He said at around 3am the woman returned to her hotel room. He said unfortunately she did not lock the door, as she had offered a spare bed to friend also at the party to avoid a lengthy journey home. 'She went to sleep still wearing her dress,' said Mr Thackray. 'She thought her friend was returning share her bed and didn't want to be naked.' 'Her next recollection was of someone being next to her, cuddling up to her. She was still half asleep and she thought it was her husband who was in bed with her. 'She wasn't immediately alarmed. She felt the person she thought was her husband touching her. 'At this point the complainant still believed that it was her husband behind her, and she reached around to assist, what she thought was her husband.' He said Britcher was attempting to rape her. 'It was at that point that alarm bells started to ring.' He said Britcher then committed a further sexual assault. Britcher is on trial at Hull Crown Court after he denied charges of rape, attempted rape and sexual assault . 'That woke her up completely and she opened her eyes. She turned her head and saw it was the defendant. She told him to f**** off. She said he looked shocked and left quickly.' Mr Thackray said after Britcher left, the woman was in a state of distress. She could not face speaking to her husband, so called her sister in tears, saying she had woken up to find a man on top of her. 'She did not immediately call the police,' said Mr Thackray. The woman then rang a member of her chambers as others were still socializing at the party. The police were then informed by a solicitor and arrived at the hotel to arrest Britcher whose fingerprints, DNA, and photograph was taken. He said cocaine was found in Britcher's body in a concentration consistent with him having taken it during the evening. The earlier victim told police Britcher indecently assaulted told her after she got into bed and went to sleep following a party. On the occasion she told him to get off her. The woman, who also cannot be named for legal reasons, said there was a second incident a year later when he raped her. In police interview, Britcher denied the first sexual assault with the first woman had taken place and said the second incident he accepted sex took place, but said it was consensual. Crown barrister John Thackray said: 'It is the prosecutions case that whilst under the influence of alcohol, and on one occasion cocaine, on three separate occasions, the defendant has committed sexual acts in the clear and obvious knowledge that both women were not consenting. 'These are two entirely unconnected complainants, who have each made remarkably similar allegations against the same man, in complete ignorance of the other's allegations.' The trial continues.

ff5df0f635fa02d54fda4bbfa2a00cc124fea1c6,"(CNN Student News) -- The foundation of a democratic republic is suffrage: the right to vote. Universal suffrage extends this civil right to all adults without distinction to race, sex, belief, intelligence or economic or social status. In the United States, almost all adult citizens over the age of 18 may vote in the presidential election. To this day, U.S. citizens who reside in Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other U.S. territories do not vote in presidential elections, but may vote in local elections. Throughout America's history, certain groups of citizens were disenfranchised. Poll taxes, literacy requirements and physical barriers effectively removed these individuals from the voting pool. Court decisions, local legislation and Constitutional amendments overturned many of these conditions for voting. Milestones in American Suffrage . 1787 - The U.S. Constitution The Constitution, as originally written, did not define a citizen. Any citizen of a state was deemed a citizen of the nation. At the time, most states only granted the right to vote to white male property owners. By 1850, most landowner requirements were eliminated. 1865 - Amendment XIII In the aftermath of the Civil War, three amendments were ratified that expressly addressed the role of blacks in America: the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The Thirteenth Amendment was the first step towards full suffrage for black adult males, as it abolished slavery in the U.S. 1868 - Amendment XIV The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution defines the U.S. citizen, and thus clarifies who may vote: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside."" Children of immigrants, even illegal immigrants, are citizens and may vote when they come of age. However, this amendment does not expressly grant suffrage to non-whites and women. It does set the legal age for voting at 21. This amendment also allows a state to remove the right to vote for ""participation in rebellion, or other crime."" As a result, most states still ban incarcerated felons from voting, and several states extend that ban to ex-felons. 1870 - Amendment XV The Fifteenth Amendment forbids the federal government and the states from using a citizen's race, color or previous status as a slave as a disqualification for voting. By this amendment, suffrage is granted for black adult males, but not females. Many in the women's suffrage movement condemned the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments as unfair to women. 1920 - Amendment XIX By the turn of the century, women were voting in many western states, but most states still banned them from the voting booth. In 1920, after several failed attempts, the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. This amendment prohibits states or the federal government from restricting suffrage based on gender. 1961 - Amendment XXIII This amendment finally granted District of Columbia voters the ability to participate in presidential elections. 1964 - Amendment XXIV In the century that followed the Civil War, racial tension persisted. Five southern states still had a poll tax, which was eliminated by this amendment. The Supreme Court declared that even a $1.50 poll tax was an unfair burden. 1965 - The Voting Rights Act After blacks were granted the right to vote in 1871, literacy requirements, physical violence, property destruction, hiding the polls and economic pressures still kept many blacks from voting, particularly in the South. In some states, a voter could vote in primary elections only if his grandfather had been able to vote in primaries; other states only allowed whites to vote in the primaries. In the largely Democratic South, these laws prevented descendants of slaves from having an effective vote. The Voting Rights Act was enacted in direct response to the Civil Rights movement. The act bans literacy tests and provides federal enforcement of voter registration and voting rights. 1971 - Amendment XXVI During the Vietnam War, many Americans felt it was unfair to send citizens to fight a war without the right to vote. This amendment sets the voting age at 18 across the nation for all elections. 1975 - Voting Rights Act Reauthorization By 1972, most adult citizens of the U.S. had the right to vote based on provisions in the Constitution. Congress amended the Voting Rights Act in 1975 to include language assistance for minority voters, who often could not vote if ballots and instructions were only available in English. 1990 - Americans with Disabilities Act The ADA addressed the need for physical access to the ballot box for all Americans.

The death of a 19-year-old from Nebraska who shot himself in the head may have been broadcast live on a video chat room, police fear. Bellevue officers want to talk to any chatroom users who witnessed the man’s death, at around 3am on Saturday morning. Police Chief John Stacey said the shooting in the Omaha suburb was reported Saturday morning by someone in Florida who heard about it online.

ff5e3dd3f12a90f7275b53fc53d5d87662e4a0a2,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee has launched a review of the Bush administration's controversial interrogation and detention program. Newly appointed CIA Director Leon Panetta says review should not target CIA interrogators. The purpose of the review is to fully understand the program and to help ""shape detention and interrogation policies in the future,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the committee, and Sen. Kit Bond, the committee's ranking Republican, said in a statement Thursday. The Senate study will run parallel to one ordered by President Obama shortly after he took office. Obama wants to know whether any of the harsh interrogation methods used against suspected terrorists held by the CIA should be retained. The so-called ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" included waterboarding, which simulates drowning and is considered torture by the new administration. Bush officials repeatedly insisted detainees were not tortured during questioning. The Senate review will look at how the CIA determined detainees knew valuable information and whether the coercive techniques used against them resulted in gaining information that stopped terrorist attacks. The study will also examine whether the agency accurately described the scope of the program to the Office of Legal Counsel and the Senate oversight committee, and if the program was in compliance with legal opinions and policy. The announcement comes the day after the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman called for the establishment of a nonpartisan ""commission of inquiry"" to investigate allegations of wrongdoing against former Bush administration officials in their prosecution of the war on terrorism. Nothing ""did more to damage America's place in the world than the revelation that our great nation stretched the law and the bounds of executive power to authorize torture and cruel treatment,"" Sen. Patrick Leahy said at the start of a committee hearing. CIA Director Leon Panetta said last week he would cooperate with any congressional reviews. ""I think that we have a responsibility to be transparent on these issues and to provide them [congressional committees] that information,"" Panetta said. But Panetta said the reviews should not target the CIA interrogators. ""I would not support, obviously, an investigation or a prosecution of those individuals"" involved in the interrogation program,"" Panetta said. ""They did their job, they did it pursuant to the guidance that was provided them, whether you agreed or disagreed with it."" In a letter to the CIA staff on Thursday, Panetta said Feinstein and Bond made it clear to him the goal of the review is not to punish anyone. ""They assure me that this review is a way for the committee to assess lessons learned from the program while our government devises a new interrogation policy,"" wrote the CIA director. The Senate review is expected to take about a year to complete. No public hearings are planned.","Review will look at how CIA concluded detainees knew valuable information .

ff5e56f3b6439a6dece8197001787a78a99e34ef,"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama announced Monday that he has signed an executive order allowing new sanctions against companies that enable Syria and Iran to use technology such as cell phone monitoring to carry out human rights abuses. The order is part of a broader strategy intended to strengthen the administration's ability to prevent atrocities, including creation of an Atrocities Prevention Board, Obama said in somber remarks at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day. ""These technologies should be in place to empower citizens, not to repress them,"" Obama said of the measure, which targets the Syrian and Iranian governments, as well as companies that provide them with high-tech equipment to use against their own people. A White House statement said the executive order signed Sunday ""authorizes sanctions and visa bans against those who commit or facilitate grave human rights abuses via information technology ... related to Syrian and Iranian regime brutality."" ""This novel sanctions tool allows us to sanction not just those oppressive governments, but the companies that enable them with technology they use for oppression and the 'digital guns for hire' who create or operate systems used to monitor, track, and target citizens for killing, torture, or other grave abuses,"" the White House statement said. Obama said the new Atrocities Prevention Board will meet for the first time on Monday at the White House. It will have members from several government departments, including State, Defense, Treasury, Justice and Homeland Security, as well as other agencies, to help the United States improve its ability to identify and respond more quickly to threats of atrocities, according to the White House statement. ""Across government, alert channels will make sure that information about unfolding crises and dissenting opinions reach decision-makers, including me,"" Obama said. Other steps include what Obama called the first-ever intelligence assessment on the risk of mass atrocities and genocide, saying the goal is to ""institutionalize the focus on this issue."" ""Our Treasury Department will work more quickly to deploy its financial tools to block the flow of money to abusive regimes,"" the president said. ""Our military will take additional steps to incorporate the prevention of atrocities into its doctrine and its planning. The State Department will surge our diplomats and experts in a crisis."" He received applause from the audience of Holocaust survivors and others when he said, in clear reference to the situation in Syria, that ""national sovereignty is never a license to slaughter your people."" Obama has come under heavy criticism on foreign policy issues recently from Republicans, including his certain opponent in the November election, Mitt Romney, and the president's comments appeared aimed at defending a range of acts by his administration that he said saved ""countless lives"" around the world. Calling the prevention of atrocities and genocide a ""core national security interest"" as well as a core American value, Obama added: ""That does not mean that we intervene militarily every time there is an atrocity committed. We cannot and should not."" Instead, he cited a growing range of tools available and referred to specific achievements such as creation of the world's newest nation of South Sudan as part of a treaty that ended decades of war, resolution of a leadership crisis in Ivory Coast and the resolution of the Libyan crisis. Obama also announced that he is extending the work of American advisers in Uganda helping pursue the Lord's Resistance Army and its leader, Joseph Kony, who are accused of widespread atrocities. ""Today I can announce that our advisers will continue their efforts to bring this madman to justice and to save lives,"" Obama said. Monday's visit to the Holocaust memorial museum was Obama's first as president. He was accompanied by Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor, who urged Obama and world leaders to prevent atrocities such as attacks on citizens occurring in Syria. In particular, Wiesel said threats by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to use nuclear weapons to destroy Israel must be confronted. ""How is it that the Holocaust number one denier -- Ahmadinejad -- is still a president,"" Wiesel said in introducing Obama. ""He who threatens to use nuclear weapons ... to destroy the Jewish state. Have we not learned? We must know that when evil has power, it is almost too late."" In his remarks, Obama repeated his administration's policy on the issue, saying: ""The United States will do everything in our power to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon."" The president has come under criticism from Republicans and some pro-Israel groups for not taking stronger steps to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. Israel has made clear it is considering a military strike on Iran's nuclear energy facilities. The Obama administration argues it has worked with international partners to strengthen sanctions against Iran, and more time is needed for those steps to weaken the Iranian economy and influence the regime's behavior. Romney, in a speech earlier this year to the pro-Israel group AIPAC, excoriated the administration's ""policy of engagement with Iran,"" but erroneously asserted the president had opposed sanctions against Iran at that point. Supporters of the administration were quick to point out that the most crippling set of sanctions against Iran since initial legislation was passed in the late 1990s occurred under Obama's watch. In his remarks Monday, Obama also announced that he will award the nation's highest civilian honor -- the Presidential Medal of Freedom -- to the late Jan Karski, a resistance figure who tried to alert the world to the Holocaust atrocities during World War II.

ff5f03b8b02271e5af6cf43130a70e5e61e3a3e5,"Vicksburg, Mississippi (CNN) -- Storms were forecast Saturday for areas already suffering from the swollen Mississippi River, as Mississippi's governor urged caution. The rain comes as the Mississippi River was cresting in Natchez, Mississippi. The water was cresting at 61.8 feet, or 13.8 feet above flood stage there, according to the National Weather Service. There were some early signs of recovery farther north in Vicksburg, where the river had already crested, though the floodwaters are expected to remain for weeks. The Yazoo backwater levee near Vicksburg had hit its peak, CNN affiliate WLBT reported. ""These levees are going to be more and more saturated every day. There will be continuing wave action up against them and so people shouldn't drop their guard,"" Gov. Haley Barbour told reporters in Yazoo City Friday. Although many displaced residents in Vicksburg are eager to return to their homes, until the water level recedes, only emergency officials will be allowed, WLBT reported. ""It is illegal to drive a boat in flooded areas and it will remain so until that executive order is lifted, which won't be soon,"" Barbour said. The governor also warned of health risks to both the emergency responders and residents. ""We've had reports of water samples where the E. coli level was 200 times normal. This stuff is nasty,"" Barbour said. The governor himself owns a lake home that has been flooded. The Mississippi River is not expected to return to its 43-foot flood stage in Vicksburg until after June 14, which is 46 days after it climbed out of its banks, said Amanda Roberts, a National Weather Service hydrologist. It crested at 57.1 feet Thursday. The river is more than a foot over the record set in the city in 1927. ""We're in need of, first off, a place to live. And then second off, pretty much everything you would need in a home,"" evacuee Pat Wilsoe told CNN affiliate WAPT. Vicksburg resident Hoover Youenger told the station his home had several feet of water in it. ""In a way, it feels like a big loss, but with Mother Nature you can't do anything about it,"" he said, WAPT reported. Severe storms are likely Saturday and Sunday in the Mississippi River, Ohio River and Tennessee River valleys. Up to 3 inches of rain per hour are possible, with heavier storms on Sunday. The rain could lead to secondary crests and higher crests along the Mississippi from Memphis, Tennessee, southward, CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said. Some greeted the cresting floodwaters -- which have damaged hundreds of homes and displaced 2,000 Vicksburg residents -- with relief. Others just went to work. Rusty Larsen, owner of Rusty's River Front Grill in Vicksburg, told CNN affiliate WJTV that his business has picked up some with the floods. ""We stay busy most days anyway, but there's been a lot of people downtown,"" he said. ""I see a lot of local people. Some of them are tourists. Everybody wants to come see the water."" Local officials caution that some area residents may have to wait to return to their homes. Flooded houses pose a variety of dangers, they said. Rising floodwaters bring debris, hazardous waste and gas leaks, and force snakes or other potentially dangerous animals from their habitats and into residential areas. ""Right now we're moving to the recovery stage,"" Vicksburg Mayor Paul Winfield told CNN. ""Our first priority, I believe, should be public safety, to continue to encourage our residents and onlookers to stay free of the water."" Law enforcement officials are patrolling evacuated areas to help ensure that abandoned homes and businesses aren't burglarized, Winfield said. And each flooded property must be assessed before an owner can return to it, he said. Warren County, which includes Vicksburg, has ""several hundred homes that have water"" and about 2,000 residents have been displaced, Sheriff Martin Pace said. County residents are accustomed to flooding and know what to do, but none have experienced it at this magnitude, according to Pace. A slide was detected on the mainline Mississippi levee at Lake Albemarle, the Corps of Engineers said Thursday. That occurs when the integrity of a levee is undermined because dirt and sand are being eroded, spokeswoman Eileen Williamson said. Crews are working around the clock to help fill the gaps. If the levee fails, thousands of homes and more than one million acres would be flooded, according to Peter Nimrod, the Mississippi Levee Board's chief engineer. ""So it's very important we hold this levee together,"" he said. Farther south, where the Mississippi River has not yet crested, residents were working to clear out their homes and find ways to get by. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has asked for federal assistance in grappling with flooding stemming from the Morganza Spillway, where 17 bays have been opened in hopes of sparing New Orleans farther downstream. So far, the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has delivered nearly 150,000 sandbags, 30,000 cubic yards of sand and 33,000 linear feet of fabric-lined baskets, the governor's office said. Approximately 1,150 Louisiana National Guard members have been mobilized. Mandatory evacuations were in effect Saturday in Happy Town and the Sherburne Wildlife Management Area, the St. Martin Parish Sheriff's Office said. Officials will decide whether evacuations are needed in Butte La Rose on Monday. Spillway gates are likely to be open for weeks, meaning it will be some time before the river falls below flood stage, allowing evacuees to return. The flood is the most significant to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937. It has affected nine states so far: Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

ff5f0ec44e42dcb211b0128760b0519aad35b288,"(CNN) -- Remember that messiness when Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien were battling it out on air? Or when Leno and David Letterman used to trade jabs during their monologues? Neither do we. These days the late-night focus is on the Jimmys: Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel. Fallon has managed to keep fans riveted with expectations over what musical guest might pop up next in a way that hasn't happened since Arsenio Hall left the air (admit it, you sang along when Mariah Carey did ""All I Want For Christmas"") and capitalized on the boyish charm that made him star of ""Weekend Update"" on ""Saturday Night Live."" Meanwhile Kimmel has been everywhere recently, from the cover of Rolling Stone to ruling the Web on Friday after his ""nemesis"" Matt Damon took over his show Thursday night in what turned out to be one seriously funny Kimmel roast. Thursday night's temporarily renamed show, ""Jimmy Kimmel Sucks,"" was the result of a long-time ""feud"" between Kimmel and the Academy Award winning Damon and helped pull in the viewers. It proved to be so successful that ABC has announced it will re-air the episode during prime time Tuesday night. According to a press release, the show resulted in Kimmel's highest ratings since his show moved to the 11:35 p.m. time slot this month. It ranked No.1 among late-night talk shows in both households and among the coveted 18-49 demographic, beating ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" by 62% and ""The Late Show with David Letterman"" by 120%. But don't expect Kimmel to rave about that fact on his official Twitter account, or anywhere else for that matter. During a recent appearance before a group of television critics, it was announced that Kimmel had beaten Letterman in the ratings. The Washington Post reported that when asked what it was like to ""kill Dave"" in the ratings, Kimmel was quick to retort ""I'm not killing Dave"" and point out that Letterman's ratings had not changed since Kimmel's show replaced ""Nightline"" in its time slot. That could be despite the fact that Letterman is his competition, Kimmel has a deep respect for the fellow funnyman. ""If I beat David Letterman in the ratings, does that mean I'm better than Letterman?"" Kimmel recently told Rolling Stone. ""No f***ing way."" The talk show host had less kind words for Leno, telling the publication, ""As a comedian, you can't not have disdain for what he's done: He totally sold out."" Ouch. So how is Kimmel ensuring that ABC's gamble to move his show from midnight to its new slot to make it more competitive will pay off? At this point, it seems just by being himself and continuing with what has led him to this point. Kimmel wasn't afraid to show his softer, fan side last Halloween when his hero Letterman appeared on his show.

ff5f390fbe9369dc2ba6f5f3b5a0abfe4229d78d,"When French actor Gerard Depardieu surprised locals by popping in for a dram at a small pub on the Isle of Skye, not everyone was toasting his health. While Depardieu was pictured enjoying the range of local whiskies and beer at the Am Oraban Bar on the Sleat peninsula, the Edinburgh International Film Festival was expecting him at a red carpet screening of his new movie hours later. However, Depardieu mysteriously failed to depart for Edinburgh and disappointed organisers were forced to announce that their star attraction had pulled out at the last moment. A votre sante: Gerard Depardieu pours himself a glass of Skye Gold beer in a Skye pub, hours before he was due to attend a red carpet film screening at the Edinburgh International Film Festival . Social media sites were immediately rife with speculation as to what may have befallen the veteran of 170 films, who at 65 still enjoys something of a reputation as a hellraiser. One tweeted: 'Gerard Depardieu was in a Skye pub last night bid didn't make it to @edfilmfest tonight. Wonder why?' The star of Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac pulled out shortly after being pictured during a visit to the Am Praban Bar at the Hotel Eilean Iarmain on Friday night. Pictures on social media show Depardieu sampling beer, whisky, haggis and bagpipes while filming a French TV series on Scottish food and drink. A posting on the Sleat, Perfectly Skye Facebook page, said Depardieu 'clearly enjoyed tasting the range of Gaelic whiskies' and tried 'haggis, washed down with a dram and a pint of Skye Gold from the Isle of Skye Brewery.' The posting added: 'The arrival of a ten-strong photography and support team was a surprise to visitors and locals enjoying an early evening drink and many of those had their photographs taken with the iconic actor. Bon appetit: The French actor can't resist sampling some haggis at the Am Praban Bar at the Hotel Eilean Iarmain on Friday night . 'Great news for Sleat, with the film crew choosing to enjoy our fabulous hotels, food and drink.' The following night, Depardieu was due to appear as a guest of honour at the UK premiere of his film Welcome To New York. The raunchy drama about an international financier with 'monstrous sexual appetites' has been enthusiastically trailed by the film festival on its website. But at 1.30pm on Sunday, the festival posted a notice stating: 'It is with regret that we have to announce that Gerard Depardieu has cancelled his appearance this evening.' A spokesman said organisers had been given no further details as to why the actor had pulled out, but added: 'He has let the festival down very badly.' The spokesman added that the festival was aware of photos posted on Facebook of their star attraction pouring himself a pint, but added: 'We won't be pursuing this any further because the screening has already taken place - but there is some annoyance here over his failure to attend.' Bonjour, mon ami: Depardieu meets locals as he films a French TV cooking programme on the Isle of Skye . Depardieu, who has described himself as 'someone who is a bit of a rebel, who shakes things up and who is sometimes drunk', was not available for comment. The veteran actor, who also runs a successful parallel career as a wine-grower, has long been known for his drink-fuelled excesses and unpredictable behaviour. In 2011, he was thrown off a plane from Paris to Dublin after relieving himself in the aisle in full view of other passengers. In an interview on US television he later protested: 'I'm not a monster. I'm just a man who wants to pee.' Asked if he was drunk at the time, and if there was 'any wine involved,' the actor replied: 'No'. Last year he was banned from driving for six months and fined 4,000 euros (£3,204) after he fell off his scooter in Paris and was arrested for driving while intoxicated. In January, the actor was reported to police for allegedly hurling buckets of water on customers in a bar beneath his holiday home in the southern Italian city of Lecce. He is said to have lost his temper in a row over noise. The following night, Depardieu, who took Russian citizenship in protest at proposed French tax rates of 75 per cent, poured water over drinkers, the Quotidiano Puglia newspaper reported.","Gerard Depardieu suprised locals by popping in for a dram at a pub on Skye .

ff5f3981e2e60ae17e42bb4cccfb6a26597cc1c1,"(CNN) -- Many of the Oklahoma families whose lives were devastated by the tornado will recover over time, especially with the help and support of family and community. But children need special attention as they struggle with what happened on Monday and upheavals in their family and school routines. Children's reactions will vary depending on their age and their experience with the tornado. They may get upset during a storm because they fear another tornado or worry when their parents leave their side. They might display changes in their behavior, such as irritability and anger or decreased concentration. They may withdraw or have physical complaints, and sleep or appetite troubles. It's reassuring to know these reactions are common and generally diminish over time. Their reactions are strongly influenced by how their parents, teachers and other caregivers are coping. Those teachers who took care of their students during the storm will need to seek their own supports and take care of themselves while showing kids how to cope in a positive way. Parents can help children recover by calmly talking with them about any concerns. This will be important over the weeks and months to come. Mother's instinct saves lives of 3 sons . Parents must assure children that they are safe and help them cope with distress associated with reminders of the tornado -- like sirens or the destruction they see. They should stick to normal mealtime and bedtime routines as much as possible. Adults should also be careful what they and others say in front of the kids and be especially patient with changes in children's behavior. Rest, exercise and a balanced diet are important. It helps to limit media reports and social media about the tornado. People should stay connected to friends and family and find time for activities that give them a break from additional stress. If the children have lost a loved one, it's important to talk about it. Parents can reminisce about that person with their kids and conduct a memorial activity that children can join in. Grieving is even more difficult when a loved one dies suddenly in traumatic circumstances. Families need their own traditions and rituals when someone dies so they can support one another and manage a wide range of emotional responses. Answering questions about death for children can be challenging -- it's important to be truthful, give answers that are appropriate for their ages and listen carefully to their feelings. Families remember tornado victims . The tornado hit during the day when children and parents were separated. Because of that, young children may become especially clingy and worry when they are away from their parents. In the next weeks, parents should stay with their children as much as possible. If they need to leave, they should make sure a familiar adult is with the children and that they know when their parents will return. If any of these reactions continue over a month or worsen over time, parents should consider a mental health consultation.As the community begins to recover, be sure to acknowledge the high school seniors who are graduating in the next week, as this is an important milestone to be commemorated. With the ending of school, some teenagers may have lost their summer jobs and it will be important to help them find alternatives like assisting recovery efforts, cleaning debris, babysitting, or organizing collection drives. Doctor's quick thinking saves patients . It's two years this week that tornadoes hit Joplin, Missouri, which is still recovering. With other recent disasters like Sandy Hook, parents are increasingly worried about their children's safety. Families should take this opportunity to make sure that school and family emergency plans are in place. That, and open communication will go a long way toward supporting children with their responses to this devastating tornado. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Melissa Brymer.","Melissa Brymer: Children need special attention to cope with trauma and upheaval .

Lowry painting but they are in fact a group of tourists admiring the vast expanse of Death Valley. Photographer David Hellard, 46, took the shots as the sun rose over vast, colourful cliffs during a two day expedition in the notorious Californian desert. The tiny figures give a sense of the scale of the sprawling landscape, which is the lowest and driest area in North America, and the current holder of the world's highest recorded air temperature - 56.7C in July 1913. Stunning: The tiny matchstick figures in these photographs are in fact a group of tourists admiring the vast expanse of Death Valley. They give a sense of the scale of the sprawling landscape, which is the lowest and driest area in North America and one of the hottest places anywhere on earth . Colours: David Hellard, who doesn't like heights, climbed 650 feet up a steep mountain trail in the Amargosa Range to take his photographs . Light: David Hellard said being scared of heights was actually a benefit to his photographs. 'I really studied the scene. There were a tremendous amount of things to look at, and other people tried moving around to get different views of the same things... I really tried to see what was there,' he said . Mr Hellard, who doesn't like heights, braved a steep climb up a trail to the point from which he took his stunning photographs - 650 feet up a mountain in the Amargosa Range. He was the only one in his group of five friends to spot a group of Germans touring on Harley Davidson motorbikes below. 'I don't think the people were there when I first started shooting, but I'm not sure... I am not a big fan of heights and was so nervous. The trail we climbed up was steep, narrow, and fell off sharply,' he said. 'While other people felt comfortable moving around and changing position, once I got set up I didnt feel like doing a lot of shuffling... With the winds gusting against my back, I could easily imagine my camera and tripod, my camera bag, or even me tumbling over the edge and straight down,' he added. 'The benefit to this was that I really studied the scene. There were a tremendous amount of things to look at, and other people tried moving around to get different views of the same things... I really tried to see what was there and eventually noticed the tiny figures off to my left and down,' Mr Hellard said. Observant: The photographer said the rest of his group were too busy focusing on the rolling hills off to the right of the scene to notice the group of tourists gathered below. He, on the other hand, used the sense of calm he'd had to instill in himself just to climb the mountain to maintain focus while taking the photos .

'I took a number of photos of the area while the sun came up. The colours during that time kept shifting and changing, so I was constantly returning to different 'scenes' laid out before me as they varied,' Mr Hellard said. 'The bright and brilliant reds and magentas you see are a result of the morning light. The cliffs are naturally a sort of yellow, lemon colour mixed with browns or darker reds. The variation in the tones is due to the different strata and sediments of the rock itself,' he added. 'Primarily it's really all about the soft morning light and shooting in the 'golden hours'. There was only a short window in which these photos were possible. After the sun rose, the gentle colours were washed away.

Webster made a fantastic start to the match and did not drop a leg on his way to winning the first set as an out-of-sorts Whitlock struggled to get a foothold in the game. Whitlock cut a relieved figure when he squared the match at 1-1 but that was as good as it got for the 2010 finalist. Danny Webster gestures to the crowd in delight during his match against Simon Whitlock . Whitlock congratulates Webster after a shock defeat in the first round of the PDC World Championship . Webster upped his game to take the third and fourth sets and averaged more than 94 points to his Australian opponent's 87 for the match. 'Simon wasn't at his best but I just tried to keep concentration today,' a delighted Webster told Sky Sports after securing his place in the next round. 'I was determined to try to win one for a change. I am so happy. Unbelievable.' Gary Anderson avoided Whitlock's fate by sealing a 3-1 triumph against Scott Kirchner. American Kirchner had earlier overcome New Zealander Mark McGrath to earn his first-round encounter against number four seed and 2011 finalist Anderson. Gary Anderson avoided Scott Kirchner's fate by beating Scott Kirchner on Saturday . The Flying Scotsman, who beat Adrian Lewis to win the Players Championship last month, did not look like his usual relaxed self early on but nevertheless took the first set. Kirchner responded superbly by winning three unanswered legs to draw level at 1-1 before Anderson's third-set win set him up and the 43-year-old sealed the victory after racing into the lead - after losing the first leg to his opponent - in the fourth to progress. Robert Thornton was in impressive form as he booked his place in the next round with a 3-0 victory over Andrew Gilding. The 47-year-old Scot lost just two legs in the comprehensive victory to set up a second-round showdown against Ronnie Baxter. Thornton hit two 180s in the first set and used his last dart on all three finishes to take the lead, with Gilding pinching just the one leg in reply. Thornton grabbed another pair of maximums on his way to second-set victory, before upping his game to clinch the third set and the match by hitting tops in the first, then pulling out a superb 144 outshot and wrapping it up in the next to seal a 97.6 average. Robert Thornton punches his fists in delight during his comprehensive victory over Andrew Gilding . Another significant upset of the first round saw Lawrence Ryder edge to a 3-2 victory over Justin Pipe. Australian Ryder fought back from 2-1 down to clinch victory courtesy of a strong finish that saw him win six straight legs to stun 17th seed Pipe. Ryder will face Terry Jenkins in the second round after he was a 3-1 victor against John Weber. Jenkins, a semi-finalist in 2011, was in control from the outset with no fewer than five 180s accrued in an extremely comfortable victory against his Australian opponent. Daryl Gurney fought back from 3-0 down to claim a 4-3 preliminary-round victory against Scott Mackenzie, but he was then outclassed by Baxter who moved into the second round with a 3-1 win against the Northern Irishman. Ronnie Baxter showed his class as he saw off a valiant effort from Daryl Gurney . Gurney pushed his opponent throughout but Baxter demonstrated his class when it mattered and sealed victory with a superb 12-darter including a 180 and a 104 finish. Ronny Huybrechts won all but two legs as he swept Andy Smith aside 3-0 to seal his progression to the next round. Missed doubles cost Smith dearly, with the Englishman missing four darts at doubles in the opening set, and two more at the start of the second as Huybrechts won the first six legs to set up a comfortable victory. Kyle Anderson also won through to the next round courtesy of a 3-0 triumph against Steve Beaton - who beat him by the same scoreline in the first round of last year's tournament. Anderson managed three 180s during the match, and the 27-year-old Australian wrapped up victory with a double five to set up a second-round encounter against Andy Hamilton.","The No 7 seed Simon Whitlock suffered shock defeat to Darren Webster .

ff606a03477b740ed234884d74ce270eb6068a4c,"Beijing (CNN) -- Entrepreneurs of all stripes are cashing in on the Lin-sanity phenomenon as swiftly as the NBA sensation can pull off his furious fast breaks. It has been only three weeks since Jeremy Lin, the 23-year-old American-born point guard of Taiwanese descent, came out of obscurity to lead the listless New York Knicks to a winning streak. But while their winning run has come to an end, Lin has gone on to become a media and marketing darling. Lin-related products have become hot items. In New York, merchandise retailers are doing brisk business selling Lin's No. 17 jerseys. ""He's made the Knicks relevant again,"" says Larry Dimitriou, manager of Modell's Sporting Goods store in Manhattan. Jeremy 'Lin-demand' in China . ""We constantly get Lin jerseys every day,"" he says. ""I put one in the window to show people we have them. A short time later, they're gone."" Just as nimble and quick are the publishers of ""Linsanity: The Improbable Rise of Jeremy Lin"" by Alan Goldsher, an electronic book that was turned around in just 72 hours. Available wherever e-books are sold, Goldsher's insta-book costs just $1.99. According to Digital Book World, fast-thinking authors have already churned out least seven e-books, all about the humble and wholesome Harvard graduate. The other Lin-inspired titles include, ""Jeremy Lin: Advice from Sun Tzu on Basketball and the Art of War,"" and ""The Zen of Jeremy Lin."" Not to be outdone, Lin himself has filed to trademark ""Linsanity."" The application, filed through the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, would give him exclusive rights to put the signature term on more than 50 consumer products, including clothing, mugs and even action figures. Yao Ming: 'Everyone wants to be next Jeremy Lin' Lin is not the only one to file for a trademark on the term, but he stands a good chance of winning it, according to Washington-based trademark lawyer Gary Krugman. But he would stand a poor chance if he filed in China, where trademark laws tend to favor early applicants. Few can match the prescience of Wuxi Risheng, Sports Utility Co. a Chinese manufacturer of basketballs and soccer balls. Risheng, it turns out, have registered Jeremy Lin's English and Chinese names as trademarks in China and claim to have rights to the name of the NBA's latest star until 2021. Risheng's claim, widely reported in local media, could block plans by major sporting goods companies to capitalize on China's growing interest on the new NBA standout. Jeremy Lin, known in Mandarin as Lin Shuhao, was born in the U.S. to Taiwanese parents with ancestral roots in mainland China. According to government records, Risheng applied for Lin trademarks as early as 2010, the year he graduated from Harvard University and was ignored during the NBA draft pick. ""Our boss Yu Minjie watched a lot of NBA games and noticed Jeremy some time in 2010 when he was a nobody,"" one of the partners in the company told CNN. ""We did not expect Jeremy Lin would be such an instant hit. We are happy for his success and of course we feel extremely lucky."" Risheng may have hit a jackpot if Lin's marketing magic continues. ""In China, first-to-register gets the rights,"" says Horace Lam, a Beijing-based intellectual property expert at Jones Day. ""Chinese companies are aware of this system and use it to their advantage. We see this happen every day. It's a big problem for companies and people trying to protect their intellectual property in China when they are not familiar with the Chinese system."" Marketing mavens are lusting to brand Lin. ""He's the total package, a fine athlete and a wonderful story,"" enthuses Scott Kronick, president of Ogilvy PR China. ""We think he's Lin-credible."" Risheng now makes Lin basketballs but soon might start producing jerseys and sneakers. ""Maybe we'll open franchise stores in east China,"" said the Risheng partner. ""Now more and more companies are reaching out to us seeking business tie-up opportunities."" Lam says the Jeremy Lin trademark that Risheng owns applies to a grab-bag of uses and products, including basketballs, shoes, hats, toys and gym facilities. Risheng claims trademarks for other basketball stars, including Yi Jianlian, a Chinese power forward who now plays for the Dallas Mavericks. It also has a trademark on the Chinese name for ""Jordan's Kingdom,"" an apparent reference to retired superstar Michael Jordan, for use on balls. Jordan, known as ""Qiaodan"" in Mandarin, has been aggressively doing business in China. Now he is tightening his defense. This week, Jordan filed a suit in a Chinese court against Qiaodan Sports Company Limited, another Chinese sportswear and footwear manufacturer, for unauthorized use of his name. ""It is deeply disappointing to see a company build a business off my Chinese name without my permission, use the number 23 and even attempt to use the names of my children,"" the basketball legend said in a statement. ""I am taking this action to preserve ownership of my name and my brand."" Still, intellectual property experts say it will be an uphill battle for Jordan to claim trademark rights in China. ""China requires a high threshold to prove that one is famous,"" says Lam. ""Even if Michael Jordan is a big name today, he still needs to prove that he was already famous in China long before 1997, when Qiaodan Sports first registered the name."" Trademark infringements are common and persistent in China, Lam notes. Gucci, Pfizer, Exxon Mobil and Hennessey are just some of the well-known multinational companies fighting long legal battles to protect their trademark. Even Apple, the world's biggest technology company, is embroiled in a trademark lawsuit over the sale of iPads in China, with a Chinese company claiming that it owns the right to use the iPad trademark in mainland China. To be sure, Lin-inspired marketing ideas abound. Jeremy light bulbs? That's been taken.","In New York, merchandise retailers are doing brisk business selling Jeremy Lin's No. 17 jerseys .

They are found in everything from PVC flooring and shower curtains to car dashboards – and may also be in our food. Tiny particles can enter our systems either through breathing or eating. Researchers in the New York investigated four phthalates and demonstrated an association with two, known as DnBP and DiBP. Both are found in a wide range of consumer products including dryer sheets, vinyl fabrics, lipstick, hairspray, nail polish and some soaps. Children of mothers whose exposure to DnBP and DiBP was in the top 25 per cent had IQ scores 6.6 and 7.6 points lower, respectively, than those of mothers exposed to the lowest concentrations . 'The magnitude of these IQ differences is troubling,' said Professor Robin Whyatt, from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, who took part in the study. 'A six or seven-point decline in IQ may have substantial consequences for academic achievement and occupational potential.' Phthalates are man-made chemicals thought to interfere with the natural hormones that are crucial to overall health. They are found in everything from PVC flooring and shower curtains to car dashboards – and may also be in our food. Tiny particles can enter our systems either through breathing or eating. In make-up, they are used by manufacturers to help dissolve other ingredients into a consistent solution, such as making nail polish less brittle. Previous studies have linked them to diabetes and asthma. They have also been blamed for feminising the brains of baby boys and last year the World Health Organisation warned they have 'serious implications for health. The scientists assessed the pthalate exposure of 328 New York City women and their children, all of whom were from low-income communities. Break down chemicals from the compounds left after they had been processed in the body were measured in urine samples during the last three months of pregnancy. Children of mothers whose exposure to DnBP and DiBP was in the top 25 per cent had IQ scores 6.6 and 7.6 points lower, respectively, than those of mothers exposed to the lowest concentrations. Associations were also seen for specific aspects of IQ, such as perceptual reasoning, working memory and processing speed. None of the women had been exposed to unusual levels of the chemicals, the researchers said, whose findings were reported in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE. Lead author Dr Pam Factor-Litvak, also from Columbia University, said: 'Pregnant women across the United States are exposed to phthalates almost daily, many at levels similar to those that we found were associated with substantial reductions in the IQ of children. 'While there has been some regulation to ban phthalates from toys of young children, there is no legislation governing exposure during pregnancy, which is likely the most sensitive period for brain development. 'Indeed, phthalates are not required to be on product labelling.' The scientists urged pregnant women not to microwave food in plastic containers, to avoid scented products as much as possible, and not to use certain recyclable plastics. In an earlier study, the same researchers found negative associations between exposure to DnBP and DiBP in the womb and children's mental and motor development and behaviour at age three. Earlier this year, the same group found that babies exposed to high levels of phthalates while in the womb are up to 78 per cent more at risk of getting asthma. Dr Whyatt, said: 'These chemicals are very widely used in very high volume and they are not generally listed on labels. 'There are some simple steps families can take. Avoid using plastic containers and as much as you can store your food in glass jars in the fridge.' She also suggested women check their make-up on the internet for phthalates. Phthalates are thought to be ‘endocrine-disrupting chemicals’, or EDCs, capable of interfering with the way our glands produce hormones. The cosmetics industry is particularly sensitive to suggestions that some ingredients might be EDCs. In 2012, the Danish Consumer Council asked manufacturers to stop using 17 EDCs. The makers of 58 brands agreed, but companies behind some of the world’s biggest brands did not, and found their products named and shamed by the council. Last year a World Health Organisation study concluded, to do nothing now was to ignore a vital lesson from the past. We should ‘ban chemicals in order to reduce exposure early, even when there are significant but incomplete data but before there is significant and long-lasting harm’. Not all experts agree — in September, 18 editors of pharmacology and toxicology journals signed a letter saying the EU’s proposals were driven by ‘scientifically unfounded precaution’, defying ‘common sense, well-established science and risk assessment principles’. It has since been revealed that 17 of the 18 editors had worked with the chemical, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, tobacco, pesticide or biotechnology industries. A recent study linked low libido with the additives used to soften plastics which are found in every home . Chemicals found in PVC flooring, plastic shower curtains, processed food and other trappings of modern life may be sapping women's interest in sex. A study in Otober linked low libido with the additives used to soften plastics which are found in every home. Women with the highest levels of phthalates in their bodies were more than twice as likely to say 'not tonight dear' as those with the lowest amounts. The research, presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's annual conference in Honolulu, suggests phthalates are doing psychological, as well as physical, damage. In the first study of its kind, Dr Emily Barrett, of the University of Rochester School of Medicine in the US, measured levels of phthalates in the urine of 360 pregnant women in their 20s and 30s. She also asked them how often they lost interest in sex in the months leading up to their pregnancy. Those with the most phthalates in their bodies were two and a half times as likely to say they had frequently lacked interest in sex as those with the least. She said: 'It is interesting because these are chemicals that we are all exposed to every day. They are throughout our environment and every person studied showed measurable levels.' However relationship expert Dr Pam Spurr said many factors can influence a woman's libido, including smoking, medication, having a baby or changing jobs. A spokesman for the Chemical Industries Association, which represents manufacturers, said: 'We are not aware of any globally accepted tests which can yet measure the effect chemical exposure may have on libido.'","Controversial study focuses on phthalate chemicals found in make-up .

A Bangladeshi man has claimed he was beaten at a New York City Applebee's in retaliation for the Boston Marathon bombings - because of the color of his skin. Abdullah Faruque, 30, says that he was heading out of the restaurant to smoke a cigarette when he noticed a group of Hispanic men who had been at the bar followed him out. They then confronted him. Attack: Abdullah Faruque claims he was beaten outside this Applebee's location in the Bronx after a group of customers asked him if her was 'Arab' He told the New York Post: 'One of the guys asked if I was Arab. I just shook my head, said like, ""Yeah, whatever.""' Mr Faruque said that when he tried to go back inside Applebee's, one of the men said, 'Yeah, he's a f***ing Arab,' and they attacked, beating him about the head and body. He told the paper that he did not know about the Boston bombings, because he had 'a busy day.' He said he was only beaten for a little over a minute, but he suffered a dislocated shoulder and was nearly knocked unconscious in the attack. He told the Post that he knew he was outnumbered, and just did his best to protect himself. He said it wasn't until he got home when he turned on the TV and learned of the bloodbath in Boston. Bombs: Mr Faruque said he did not know about the Boston bombings that occurred earlier in the day because he had 'a busy day' He told the paper: 'I saw the news, and then it hits me: That's why I got jumped.' The NYPD Hate Crimes unit is reportedly investigating the attack. In Boston, authorities have scoured through video footage and photos of the area near the finish line to establish suspects. Investigators are now seeking at least two men pictured in images taken before two bombs exploded near the finish line of the marathon, law enforcement and national security officials said today. Authorities are examining thousands of pictures taken by surveillance cameras, the media and ordinary citizens around the time the bomb blasts went off and are likely to try to talk to additional people, the officials said.

ff6119a7e3572fdf85aaa8af96d02d5a9bdab21e,"Urbanised areas are more likely to be hit by frequent thunderstorms than rural areas of the same size, according to a new study. Researchers studied the 'births' of thunderstorms - known as storm initiations - between 1997 and 2013 and found a significant increase in densely populated areas such as Atlanta. And this has been tied to the increased pollution levels and rising temperature in these regions compared to rural areas in the same geographical location. By studying the 'births' of thunderstorms (stock image) - officially known as storm initiations - experts have found they occur more frequently in urbanised areas. This is tied to  increased pollution levels and rising temperature in these regions compared to rural areas of the same size in the same goegraphical location . Researchers from Northern Illinois University studied radar data to pinpoint where thunderstorm initiations occurred across the southeast US between 1997 and 2013. They found that urbanised areas such as Atlanta are 5 per cent more likely to be hit by thunderstorms, on a given day, than rural areas of the same size. 'Per year, that amounts to two or three more thunderstorms of the pop-up variety,' explained lead researcher Alex Haberlie. 'These originate over the city or downwind and are separate from large and more easily predicted weather events.' Storms were more likely to hit these urbanised areas during warmer months, in July and August, in the late afternoon and early evening. And the study found more 'births' occurred during the week than at weekends. These findings add further weight to the fact rising temperatures increase the frequency of storms, but also that increased pollution levels in urban areas play a major role.

These findings add further weight to the fact rising temperatures increase the frequency of storms, but also that increased pollution levels in urban areas  play a major role. In addition to pollution, the study said urbanised areas cause more storms because they create 'urban heat-islands'. Concentrations of buildings can increase temperatures causing low pressures to form above cities, compared to high pressures in rural areas. This causes a so-called 'low-level atmospheric convergence', which forces air up into thunderstorms. Buildings may also change the flow and direction of winds, which in turn changes pressure levels and affects the upward movement of air.

This causes a so-called 'low-level atmospheric convergence', which forces air up into thunderstorms. Buildings may also change the flow and direction of winds, which in turn changes pressure levels and affects the upward movement of air. 'City planners, meteorologists and citizens who live in or near large urban areas should be aware of the increased risk,' Mr Haberlie continued. 'These storms can produce dangerous weather hazards, including lightning, hail, strong winds and flash floods, often with little or no warning.' As air is warmed by the sun and moves closer to the Equator, the air mass near the surface 'absorbs' water through evaporation. The warmer the air mass, the more water it takes up, and as it reaches the Equator, it begins to rise through the atmosphere, eventually cooling as it radiates heat out into space. Cool air typically holds less moisture than warm air, so as the air cools, condensation occurs, and heat is released. When enough heat is released, air begins to rise even further, pulling more air behind it, which ultimately causes a thunderstorm. As a result, many experts predict that global warming will cause the number of thunderstorms to increase and they are often used as indicators of rising temperatures and climate change. Thunderstorms get  energy from the heat released by the condensation of water vapour (illustrated). Using climate records, and simulations up to 2098, experts recently said warming will create more precipitation and less circulation. The number of storms will stay the same, but they will become more intense . However, earlier this month a separate study found that instead of increasing in number, storms will increase in intensity as the globe gets warmer - meaning the same number of storms will occur, but they'll be stronger. Researchers from the University of Toronto explained that the Earth's atmosphere needs fuel to work, which in this instance is energy from the sun. As air is warmed by the sun and moves closer to the Equator, the air mass near the surface 'absorbs' water through evaporation. The warmer the air mass, the more water it takes up, and as it reaches the Equator, it begins to rise through the atmosphere, eventually cooling as it radiates heat out into space. Cool air typically holds less moisture than warm air, so as the air cools, condensation occurs, and heat is released. When enough heat is released, air begins to rise even further, pulling more air behind it, which ultimately causes a thunderstorm. The 'output' of this atmospheric engine, and storms, is the amount of heat and moisture that is redistributed between the Equator and the North and South Poles. The  physicists said that this is because global warming will directly affect how the atmosphere circulates air mass, heat and water using what's been dubbed 'Earth's heat engine.' Frederic Laliberté and his colleagues from the University of Toronto compared climate records from 1981 to 2012 with climate simulations. This comparison revealed that a third of the atmospheric energy is typically involved with the movement of water through the cycle. But, as a result of climate change, the atmosphere is expected to use more energy during this part of the cycle. This is because the air will be warmer, so will take up more water, which will create more evaporation and precipitation. By using more energy to move the water, less energy is used to circulate the air mass, and an increase in water vapour, put simply, will make the process less efficient. The atmosphere still needs to get rid of the precipitation it collects, but because circulation is affected, it has to do this in fewer, more intense storms. Air masses that are able to reach the top of the atmosphere are strengthened, while those that can't, are weakened.","Researchers studied radar data in the southeast US from 1997 to 2013 .

Warning: Michael Gove has been warned that 'dumbed-down' exams featuring celebrities could fatally undermine his attempt to drive up standards . Education Secretary Michael Gove has been warned that ‘dumbed-down’ exams featuring pop stars and comedians could fatally undermine his attempt to drive up standards. Experts said there has been a growing trend to introduce popular culture into exams for 30 years, and last week’s disclosure that one of the country’s biggest exam boards is introducing questions on Russell Brand and Dizzee Rascal in its new English A-level was another example. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said that exam chiefs had been competing to make themselves popular with students since the mid-1980s. But they are ‘short-changing’ pupils because popular culture was ‘shallow and transitory’. A Mail on Sunday survey shows that questions based on popular culture have appeared in exam papers for a number of years, and experts have criticised the Government for failing to take action. Government adviser Chris McGovern said Mr Gove promised to introduce A-levels with more rigour and depth, but ‘a clear direction of travel’ had been revealed in the new English A-level syllabus by the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA (OCR) board. He said: ‘Everything that this Government has fought for in terms of raising educational standards will stand or fall  on the quality of public examinations. ‘The new syllabus for A-level English is one small indicator that, for all the talk  of reform in education, not a great deal is likely to change in the classroom.’ Sheila Lawlor, director of think tank . Politeia, said using ‘celebrity speak’ because boards felt it encouraged . children to engage was a ‘regrettable trend’. Exams: Experts said there has been a growing trend to introduce popular culture into exams for 30 years . Under the . OCR proposals, teenagers will study the delivery style, purpose and . features of ‘celebrity language’ alongside Shakespeare and William . Blake. The . English exam, to be introduced next year, will feature extracts from . Brand’s appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee when he gave . evidence on drug addiction.

'But you can get ketchup here, Nutella and cornflakes.' Scroll down for video . A picture believed to show Sabina Selimovic, 15, with jihadi fighters in Syria: An interview given by the Austrian teenager saying how she feels 'she can really be free' among the extremists may have been given at gunpoint . Don't look for us. We will serve Allah – and we will die for him': Samra Kesinovic, 17, left, and Sabina, right, left the Austrian capital in April leaving a note for their parents explaining they had gone to join the jihad in Syria . Austrian anti-terror agents believe the interview given by Sabina, who is now married to a jihadi fighter, was probably carried out at gunpoint. Weeks earlier friends and family of Sabina said she had told them in online conversations she regretted leaving Vienna for Syria and wanted to come home. Sabina and her friend Samra Kesinovic, 17, left the Austrian capital in April, leaving a note telling their parents they had gone to fight in Syria. They come from Bosnian refugee families who settled in Austria after the former Yugoslavia collapsed into ethnic warfare in the 1990. Born in Austria, it is believed they radicalised through a local mosque. But the later claim Sabina wanted to leave and come back to Austria had reportedly infuriated ISIS leaders, who are waging a constant propaganda war to attract new recruits. Anti-terrorism police in the girls' homeland said it is almost certain she would have been ordered to publicly disavow what she had said. It is believed both Samra and Sabina married IS fighters soon after arriving in Syria. The two couples initially lived in the same room but the 15-year-old has reportedly now moved out to a different flat. Speaking by SMS messages to French weekly Paris Match, Sabina denied claims she was pregnant and insisted she was enjoying life in Syria, where she felt free to practise her religion in a way that she did not in Austria. The magazine did manage to confirm the teenager had only been allowed to speak to them with the permission of her husband, who was in the room as she wrote her answers. She said after arriving to Turkey from Austria they crossed over the border into Syria on foot. They ended up in the city of Raqqa, she said, after arriving in the country with nothing other than the clothes they were wearing. Sabina said her husband was a soldier and added: 'Here I can really be free. I can practice my religion. I couldn't do that in Vienna.' Jihadi brides: The two girls in their new life in a pic they posted online . Looking over the Euphrates: Sabina said she and Samra had ended up in the Islamic State stronghold Raqqa . Radical chic: Sabina and Samra could be prosecuted if they do ever manage to return to Austria . In Vienna, experts who studied the transcript of Sabina's interview said it was almost certain she had been forced to speak to the magazine by her husband, who was a fighter in the ISIS-terrorist militia. The experts, who preferred to remain anonymous, said the story which went all round the world about the pair wanting to leave had done a lot of damage to the ISIS campaign. It was clear they were trying to put that right, the experts said. Sabina and Samra could be prosecuted if they do ever manage to return to Austria. Austrian police who are looking into the circumstances of the girl's disappearance have also compiled a dossier about the girls' links with terrorist groups. Before leaving the country Sabina and Samra had started lecturing schoolmates in Vienna about their lifestyle and were suspected behind a vandalism attack on their school calling for jihad. When they disappeared, their parents found notes in their bedrooms saying 'Don't look for us.

The scarf is backed by mainstream Muslim groups including the Islamic Society of Britain and profits from its sale will be donated to the Poppy Appeal. The scarf, which costs £22, will be launched tomorrow to mark 100 years since the first Muslim soldier was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the WW1.

Khudadad Khan, a machine gunner in an Indian colonial regiment, fought on the Western front during WW1 in support of the British Expeditionary Force. Sughra Ahmed, President of the Islamic Society of Great Britain, said she wanted to take attention away from the ‘angry minority’ of extremists who spout hatred. Three years ago, a group calling itself ‘Muslims Against Crusades’ sparked outrage when it burned a poppy on Remembrance Sunday . Ms Ahmed said: ‘Thousands of British Muslims already wear a poppy in November. This is just another way for them to show they remember those who gave their lives for their country. ‘It’s also a way for ordinary Muslim citizens to take some attention away from extremists who seem to grab the headlines. ‘This symbol of quiet remembrance is the face of everyday British Islam – not the angry minority who spout hatred and offend everyone. ‘We’re launching this today as it’s exactly 100 years since the first Muslim soldier was awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery – Khudadad Khan from Pakistan, who was fighting for Britain on the Western Front in the First World War.’ Sughra Ahmed, President of the Islamic Society of Great Britain, said he wanted to divert attention from an 'angry minority' of extremists who in the past have burned poppies on Remembrance Sunday (pictured) Khan was a member of the 129th Baluchis regiment fighting near in Belgium. On 31st October, 1914, at Hollebeke, Sepoy Khudadad carried on firing the gun on his own, after the five other men of his gun detachment were killed. Despite having been wounded, he fought on long enough to hold off an enemy advance until Indian and British reinforcements arrived. He was awarded the highest military award for gallantry by King George V in December that year. More than 400,000 Muslim soldiers fought for Britain in World War 1. Think tank British Future is promoting the scarf as part of efforts to remind the public about the role of Commonwealth soldiers in British military history. Sunder Katwala, the British Future’s Director of Integration said: ‘Remembrance brings Britain together each November - and has a special resonance as we all mark the centenary of the First World War. ‘The armies that fought a century ago look more like the Britain of 2014 than that of 1914. Yet few people realise that 400,000 Muslims fought for Britain in the First World War. ‘Many British Muslims won’t know this, while most Britons are surprised at the scale of the Muslim contribution to the Commonwealth effort.’ The scarf was designed by a Muslim fashion designer, Tabinda-Kauser Ishaq, a 24-year-old student at the University of the Arts in London. She said: ‘I hope the poppy headscarf gives Muslim women a new way to mark Remembrance Day and to help raise money for the Poppy Appeal.

Officials say the search for a prominent outdoors writer on Mount Rainier was suspended after a woman's body was found, but the remains weren't immediately identified, officials said. Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Patti Wold said that the body was recovered about 3 p.m. PDT in the general area where teams had been searching for 70-year-old Karen Sykes. She said that the woman's body was found off the trail near Boundary Creek in rough, steep terrain - an area difficult to access and not commonly traveled. There was no immediate word on the cause of death, and Wold said the medical examiner would determine the woman's identity. Park officials had announced earlier in the day that the search had been suspended but did not elaborate. Missing: Crews continue to search Mount Rainier National Park for Seattle hiker Karen Sykes, who was reported missing late Wednesday . Sykes hasn't been seen since she separated from her hiking partner on Wednesday. She was reportedly working on a story when she and her partner encountered snow about 5,000 feet. Her partner stayed as she went on, with the idea that they'd reconvene, but she never turned up. The partner, who made it safely back to the trailhead, reported her missing at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday. Six ground crews, including two dog teams, combed an expanded search area near the Owyhigh Lakes Trail on Rainier's east side Saturday. Rescuers also searched by air. Sykes, had adequate survival gear to camp overnight in an emergency, Wold said. Her friends had hoped that searchers would find her safely sheltered. Safety concerns for Sykes and search crews included snow bridges, tree wells and steep, wet, slippery terrain, Wold said. A searcher was hurt Thursday when he punched through a snow bridge and was airlifted out of the search area. Sykes is well-known in the Northwest hiking community and has written numerous hiking stories for online publications and newspapers. She is also a photographer and has authored a book about hikes in western Washington. Her disappearance comes weeks after six climbers are believed to have fallen to their deaths while attempting to climb a challenging route to the summit of the 14,410-foot peak southeast of Seattle. Karen Sykes (left), an experienced hiker and writer, had adequate survival gear to camp overnight in the event of an emergency, officials said. She was working on a story when she went missing . Crews scoured the Owyhigh Lakes area of Mount Rainer hoping to find Sykes. They focused on the length of the eight-mile trail on Thursday. Six ground crews combed an expanded search area near the Owyhigh Lakes Trail on Saturday. Rescuers also searched by air . Lola Kemp, a close friend who planned to hike with Sykes this weekend, said in an email Friday that she was anxious but still hopeful that searchers will find Sykes, safely sheltered somewhere. 'She is the guru of trails,' said Kemp, adding that Sykes hikes at least twice a week and has a background in climbing and scrambling. 'I find it difficult to imagine that she would get lost. I think it's more likely she's injured and waiting, perhaps impatiently, to be rescued.' Greg Johnston, a former outdoors writer for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, said Sykes was an avid, strong hiker who knew the mountain extremely well. 'She's the last person anyone would expect to get lost, particularly on Mount Rainier,' said Johnston, who recruited Sykes to write a weekly hiking feature for that newspaper, which ran for more than a decade. 'If anybody can survive it, it's her. She's really tough and really savvy.' Mount Rainier, a dormant volcano located near Seattle, spawns six major rivers and is a well-known hiking destination . Search teams were scouring steep, rugged terrain in the Owyhigh Lakes area for a second day Friday. They were focused along the length of the 8-mile Owyhigh Lakes Trail. In a separate search, an injured climber was airlifted Thursday off Double Peak after crews responded to a spot-locator beacon.","A woman's body was found on Mount Rainer Sunday in the general area where teams had been searching for 70-year-old Karen Sykes .

ff62294d3016f6796d0ed12cfe56b8bc69681679,"More issues in Ferguson: Former Ferguson, Missouri correctional officer Jaris Hayden is accused in a criminal suit of having sex with a pregnant inmate and then setting her free. In a separate civil suit, the inmate says she was raped by Hayden . A former Ferguson corrections officer faces felony charges and a lawsuit for allegedly having sex with a pregnant inmate and allowing her to escape, a case that comes as the St. Louis suburb's police force is already under scrutiny following the shooting death of Michael Brown. Jaris Hayden, 29, will be arraigned December 3 on charges of acceding to corruption by a public servant, permitting escape and two counts of sexual contact with a prisoner. His attorney, Scott Rosenblum, said Hayden posted $10,000 bond and intends to plead not guilty. The incident allegedly happened October 9, 2013. Hayden was indicted by a grand jury earlier this month, and the woman filed her lawsuit against Hayden on Friday in federal court. In her suit, the woman identified as J.W. alleges the misconduct began as soon as she got to the jail, when she was booked by Hayden and he told her 'You smell good' and said 'this will teach you a lesson.' According to the woman's lawsuit, she was taken to jail for driving with expired license plates and giving the officer a false name. The suit said her boyfriend had already posted $200 bond when Hayden took her to a boiler room at the jail and forced her to have sex. But while still in the cell, J.W. says she told Hayden she'd 'do anything to go home,' but that she did not mean sex notes Buzzfeed. Nonetheless, J.W. says Hayden took her downstairs and told her to perform oral sex on him, which she did. The suit says they then had vaginal intercourse. Afterwards, Hayden allegedly set her free out a side door. A pubic hair J.W. says she took from the scene has since tested positive as Hayden's. Ferguson City Attorney Stephanie Karr said in a statement that after the city learned of the complaint against Hayden, it began its own investigation that led to his firing on Nov. 19, 2013. He had worked for the city for 18 months. Karr said city officials and employees cooperated with federal authorities in the investigation. Shocking: The alleged incident occurred at the Ferguson City Jail, where a plaintiff named only as J.W. says she was raped in the boiler room before being let out a side door . The Associated Press generally does not identify alleged victims of sexual assault. The woman was only identified by her initials in the lawsuit. Bevis Schock, the woman's attorney, said the case raises renewed concerns in Ferguson. 'The numerous acts of violence against the citizenry by law enforcement of the City of Ferguson constitute a pattern,' Schock said in the lawsuit. The criminal case is different than the lawsuit in that it alleges that Hayden accepted the woman's offer to perform sex acts in exchange for allowing her to escape. Schock said the woman was raped and there was no such agreement. The suit said the woman was several months pregnant. Ferguson has been the site of protests since the 18-year-old Brown, who was unarmed, was fatally shot by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. A grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge Wilson. Ed Magee, spokesman for St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch, said the Wilson grand jury is not the same one that indicted Hayden. Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard in advance the grand jury decision about whether Darren Wilson (left) will be charged in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown (right) A St. Louis County town that neighbors Ferguson, Missouri, is warning residents to prepare for potential unrest that may follow the grand jury announcement in the Michael Brown case. Berkeley officials passed out flyers this week urging its 9,000 residents to be prepared just as they would in the event of a major storm, with plenty of food, water and medicine on hand in case they're unable to leave home for several days. The flyer says Lambert Airport will be protected by the National Guard, but airport spokesman Jeff Lea says that's wrong. Lea says the airport will continue to be protected by its own security force. Brown was killed Aug. 9 by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury is expected to decide this month whether to charge Wilson. A suburban St. Louis school district says schools will get early notice once the Ferguson grand jury reaches a decision. A letter on the Hazelwood School District's site from Superintendent Grayling Tobias says the St. Louis County prosecutor's office will alert districts 24 hours before the media if the decision is on a weekend. If it's a weekday, Tobias says districts will learn three hours before media, so students can be sent home before potential protests. District spokesman Jack Wang says districts won't be told what the decision is.","Jaris Hayden, 29, will be arraigned December 3 on criminal charges he had sex with an inmate then let her go .

Ciaran Smyth from yourtutor.com.au told Daily Mail Australia that a routine, an appropriate place to study and the occasional surprise note in a lunch box, can make all the difference to a new start. 'Talk to your child about routines and then get them into one as soon as possible. The best way for a student to adapt is to have a routine,' Mr Smyth said. Scroll down for video . Teacher and education expert Ciaran Smyth, has revealed his top tips for making the transition from holidays to day one of school more bearable . For high school students, he recommends creating a routine, picking a perfect study space and the occasional positive note in the lunch-box . 'I recommend encouraging your teen to spend the first 30 minutes to an hour after they arrive home from school doing something they enjoy – be it sport, video games, the gym or TV. This allows them to relax and disconnect from school. Then, spend a solid hour or two on homework or study before dinner.' High School . Kindergarten . Mr Smyth also suggested that parents buy the tools their children would need for school as early as possible to encourage organisation, but also allow them to pick certain details where possible to make them feel like they have a choice in their experience. 'Prepare resources in advance and contact the school to find out what you need,' he said. 'You can make the return exciting by letting them pick their own things like contact for their books or certain pens and pencils. 'If they've got a backpack and they want to decorate it- I remember I used to get a felt-tip pen and draw all over my bag - if that's what they need to do to personalise their stuff, let them do that to personalise their experience.' Finding the perfect study space that has plenty of natural light and isn't isolated from the rest of the house can ensure that study time is not torture for teens. A room with easy access to snacks and water, but free of television and computer screens is perfect according to Mr Smyth, who recommends mixing things up by using the kitchen bench (where parents are usually available to answer any questions) or even the balcony or backyard during good weather. 'Despite what most people believe, your home's traditional study room is not the best space for your child to complete their school work,' Mr Smyth said. He also recommends taking advantage of extra learning resources like local libraries and school tutoring groups as well as encouraging children to join social clubs or sports groups to make friends that can be a great source of support during stressful academic periods. He warned parents of new kindergarten pupils to make their goodbyes quick and unemotional and label everything . Pictured here with his own son Matthew, who starts school next year, Mr Smyth said: 'The number of parents who drop of their kids and go to the car for a quick cry is immense, but try not to cry at the gate because your kids will get upset as well' If it's their first day at a new school or even just the beginning of high school, Mr Smyth said that parents should never underestimate the old fashioned note in a lunch-box. 'You'll perk up their day and if they need it, it's there for them,' he said. Parents of new students avoid taking their 'first day' photos at the school to avoid nervousness . For parents who will see their toddlers take on their first ever day at school, Mr Smyth suggested that rather than clinging to their child and saying goodbye in four different ways, parents should opt for a quick and unemotional farewell. 'The best way is to make a fuss free exit, simply drop your child off, say a quick hello to the teacher and some of the students and make your getaway,' he said. 'Bring a bag of tissues, but not for the student. The amount of parents who drop of their kids and go to the car for a quick cry is immense, but try not to cry at the gate because your kids will get upset as well. 'I also recommend not sitting outside the school afterwards for 'just in case' reasons; if you're needed, the teachers will call'. First-day photographs should be taken at home according to Mr Smyth who says that: 'although it can be super cute to get photos of your child in their classroom (and on the school oval, in front of the school sign and with the teacher, head teacher and principal), it can often distract other children, draw unwanted attention to your own child and make them even more nervous about their big first day.' His final piece of advice for parents of new students is to label everything, from lunch-boxes to underpants and even show and tell items. 'Unless you're happy to fork out for a new school wardrobe every week, you should write your child's name of every item they take with them,' Mr Smyth said.","Teacher and education expert Ciaran Smyth, has revealed his top tips for making the transition from holidays to education more bearable .

Firefighters have not yet found what caused the tragic house fire in Orrick, Missouri that killed two small boys after their mother left them alone in the house while their father was sleeping. Roger Garrison, 3, and his brother Ashton Garrison, only 21-months, were trapped inside of their burning home just 35 miles Northeast of Kansas City. Randy Garrison awoke to hear his sons screaming at 11:30 am and the boys mother, Tammy Willis, was not home, he told Fox 4. A house in Orrick, Missouri burned to the ground on Tuesday killing two young children and injuring their father . Ashton Garrison was only 21-months when he died on Tuesday in a tragic fire of which the cause is still unknown . Roger Garrison,3, also died in the fire and was coincidentally named after his father's brother who died in a fire years ago . Garrison arrived home from work on Tuesday at 6 a.m. after working a 24-hour shift and went directly to bed. He saw the boys mother asleep with them on the couch. 'I Woke up hearing them screaming at the top of their lungs,' he said. 'Flames in my bedroom and flames in the hallway, flames through the whole house.' When Garrison smelled smoke he tried to burst through his bedroom hall and when he couldn't he ran into the hallway and tripped. Something may have been holding the door to his children's bedroom shut. 'I fell over a bungee cord or something that was holding their bedroom door shut,' he said. 'I ran out the back door around to the front, started ripping the sheeting off the house and trying to punch through that way and I couldn’t.' The Ray County Sheriffs Office asked for help from the patrol's drug and crime unit to investigate the case. They could not say whether or not something had been holding the door shut. Tammy Willis (left) and Randy Garrison(right) were not married but had two children together and lived together for the sake of their children . The home that burned down on Tuesday is entirely decimated and the cause of the fire in still unknown . Tammy's mother Marjorie Long claims that her daughter (right) pictured with her son Ashton, loved her children and would 'starve for them' Garrison was hospitalized for burns and blisters and was never able to make it through the fire to save his boys. Garrison claims he didn't know that the boy's mother was leaving. The couple were not married but lived together for the sake of the children. 'The mother was in the house whenever I went to sleep this morning,' he said. 'And I woke up to her not being here, but my kids were here. You’d think a parent would either wake up another adult in the house or take the kids with her.' Willis' mother Marjorie Long claims that the daughter woke Garrison. Long told Fox 4 that her daughter is in the hospital on heavy medication and deeply mourns the loss of her children. 'She was quite clearly upset,'  Long said to KCTV. 'Several of the . firemen, police were holding her back because she was wanting to run . into the still burning remains of the house to get them,' she continued.

Even though Ashton's (pictured) and Roger's parents have identified their bodies, police are still running DNA to confirm the children's identities . The cause of death remains a mystery and so does the cause of the fire but Garrison thinks arson may have been involved in the death of his two sons . 'She is very loving, very caring. She puts her kids before anything else,' Long said. 'She would starve herself to make sure that the kids had food, to go without things she needed to make sure that they got what they needed,' Long continued. Long told reporters that their daughter is bi-polar. Garrison told reporters that his children were very important to him. 'They were my rock, everything I had in life,' Garrison said. 'The only reason I woke up everyday was for my boys.' 'What would go through your mind after hearing your kids scream bloody murder and basically watching them die in front of you?' he asked KCTV5. Investigators don't know what started the fire but Garrison told reporters, 'I'm still wondering if it's not arson.' Coincidentally, Garrison named one of . his sons Roger after his brother who died in a fire a few years ago. Mail Online spoke with Sgt. Collin Stosberg, a spokesperson for the Highway Patrol, who said that the case is still under investigation.

And a playful appearance on The Colbert Report brought no light relief for President Obama. Amid jokes about his approval ratings and big ears, he could not escape a grilling about his move to protect five million immigrants from deportation without Congress approval. Host Stephen Colbert, who is known for scolding his interviewees, accused Obama of exceeding his authority with his executive order. 'When did you decide to burn the Constitution and become emperor?' he asked. Scroll down for video . Playful appearance: President Obama told Stephen Colbert his family tease him about his big ears and suits . The question was heard as a joke by many in the audience at George Washington University. But to Obama's critics, the question had a ring of truth. Obama dropped the comedy and replied: 'Actually, Steve, everything that we have done is scrupulously within the law and has been done by previous Democratic and Republican presidents.' The tongue-in-cheek question came at the close of a playful interview, in which the President revealed his family make sure power doesn't go to his head. His daughters mock his big ears and his stuffy suits, and he leaves his socks on the floor, he told Colbert. In fact, he said, he feels much more important sitting behind the revered chat show host's desk. 'When I go home, Michelle, Malia and Sasha give me a hard time. There are no trumpets, and they tease me mercilessly.' His comments came on the special DC edition of the show. Colbert also addressed his delayed decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline, chiding that it should run into Mexico and around the world. Skit: Posing as Colbert, the President joked about his poor approval ratings and lack of support for Obamacare . Regular: It is Obama's third appearance on the show - his second since taking office in 2009 . Moving on: The show, filmed in Washington, DC, was one of Colbert's last as he prepares to move to CBS . It was Obama's third appearance on the show, his second as president, and marked the beginning of the final two weeks for the Comedy Central show. Colbert will take over for David Letterman on CBS' 'Late Show' next year. Obama kicked off the show sitting in for Colbert to perform a regular feature of the program called 'the Word' wherein Colbert's rants are accompanied by snarky messages to the audience.

Later, Colbert observed that the economy had been creating more jobs of late. 'Emperor': The pair laughed about Obama's used of an executive order to protect immigrants from deportation . Debate: Colbert, who is known for scolding his interviewees, gave his views on the Keystone pipeline . 'You have employed a lot of people - mostly as secretary of defense,' Colbert cracked in a reference to Obama recently nominating his fourth top civilian at the Pentagon. 'That's boosted our numbers a little bit,' Obama replied. As he wrapped up, Colbert had one last question: 'Barack Obama - great president or the greatest president?' 'I'm going to let someone else decide - not you, but someone who knows what they're talking about,' the president replied. Colbert countered: 'Stephen Colbert - great pundit or the greatest pundit?'

ff6555ef0fed5448fbfd25448c470225d49245b8,"As the popular ITV drama Downton Abbey is set in an era before make-up was commonplace, the ladies of the manor have to showcase a natural look. But with the glare of the on-set lights and the need to look fresh and glamorous at all times, the stars of course wear cosmetics. Now Laura Carmichael, 28, who plays Lady Edith, has revealed the tricks of the trade that are used by the show's make-up artist Magi Vaughan. Scroll down for video . Twenties-inspired: Lisa Eldridge gives actress Laura Carmichael a natural make-over, left, recreating her style from Downton Abbey series three, right . Laura shares the secrets with make-up artist Lisa Eldridge as she recreates her natural look from series three. In a video tutorial using Laura as her model, Lisa uses products widely available to buy so people without their own professorial make-up artist can get the look at home. Lisa said she wanted to recreate Lady Edith's natural style because she's 'a big fan of the show and I have made up lots of the female cast for cover shoots and red carpet events'. Downtown Abbey series three was set in 1920-21, an era when most women didn't wear make-up. Laura said: 'We were always asking for a bit more lip or blush in the make-up chair but we're not allowed. It would just look wrong.' Lisa explains: 'Women in the early 20s didn't wear make-up and it was associated with actresses and women of ill-repute.' Get the look: On the set of Downton, an air brush is used but Lisa uses make-up brushes . As a result, the Downton Abbey actresses needed to have a realistic, natural look (although in the current series set later in the twenties they can wear more make-up as it was beginning to catch on). To achieve natural look, Magi used an air brush - where make-up is sprayed on instead of applied using brushes and sponges. Laura said of getting air brushed in the make-up chair every day: 'You do get used to it but it's weird to begin with and the guys find it hilarious. But you can do a lot with it in terms of shading.' Lisa chose not to use an air brush, opting instead to use L'Oreal Infallible Foundation, applied with a make-up brush so people can more easily copy her. She also uses Laura Mercier SC1 Secret Camouflage concealer and Chanel loose powder. Lisa then applies Daniel Sandler's Water Colour Blush Cherub to Laura's cheeks. Subtle effect: Lipstick Queen Medieval is used to stain the lips . She explains: 'It's important for this look to be rosy, pretty but natural and healthy looking. Women at the time would have pinched their cheeks to create that rosy glow without make up.' For the eyes, Lisa then uses Stila In The Know Eyeshadow Palette 'rain' shade, using a brush to avoid lines, then adds the darker 'driftwood' shade along the lower and upper lash line. She defines Laura's eyebrows with Rimmel Brow This Way powder then curls her eye lashes. Laura reveals that on the show, they are often not allowed to wear mascara so instead they tint their eyelashes. When they do wear mascara for a special occasion, it's brown or clear. The true natural look: Lisa before the make-over . Voila! The actress was happy with the result . Lisa replicates this by using Chanel brown mascara then little bit of clear mascara. Finally to finish the look, Lisa adds Lipstick Queen Medieval. She explains how this gives a 'subtle berry effect like you've just eaten, so it's a natural stain.' She then uses a No7 nude lip pencil to add definition to the lip line - another trick used on the Downton set. Unveiling Laura's make-over, the actress says she's pleased with the result. 'It's perfect, natural but pretty. I love the lip colour,' she said.","Make-up wasn't worn excessively in the Twenties .

'We need to abolish the IRS,' he said, calling instead for a flat income tax rate and a user-friendly tax return that can be filed on a postcard. That verbal gauntlet, thrown as much at a near-century of tax collection as at the Obama administration, was Cruz's biggest applause line. 'By virtue of your being here today,' he jokingly cautioned the nation's largest annual gathering of politically conservative activists, 'tomorrow each and every one of you is going to be audited by the IRS.' On Wednesday the former IRS official in charge of vetting nonprofit groups that seek tax-exempt charitable status refused, for the second time, to tell a congressional committee what she knew about the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sen. Ted Cruz, the conservative pit bull who will likely run for president in 2016, demanded the abolition of the Internal Revenue Service on Thursday . Fear of government is a unifying concept at CPAC, wth Ted Cruz leading the charge to de-fang Washington's ability to use the tax code as a weapon . Lois Lerner claimed the Constitution's Fifth Amendment afforded the right to remain silent, despite a party-line ruling from the House Oversight Committee that she waived that privilege by offering a lengthy opening statement in a May 2013 hearing. More than 200 right-wing organizations, mostly those linked to the tea party movement, sat in limbo for as many as three years while the IRS dithered and held them up during two election cycles. The agency is now moving toward new regulations that would allow it to codify the secret rules it used to screen out conservative organizations while quickly green-lighting liberals. During a Super Bowl Sunday interview with Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly, President Barack Obama insisted that there was 'not even a smidgen of corruption' in his administration related to the controversy. Channeling a character in the 1987 cult classic movie The Princess Bride, Cruz mocked the president for his choice of words. 'You keep on using this word,' he said, referring to 'smidgen.' 'I do not think it means what you think it means.'

Cruz seemed to be tightening and road-testing a stump speech himself, advocating for the repeal of the Dodd-Frank banking law, safeguards to buttress the Second Amendment's gun rights, expanding school choice, permanently banning former members of Congress from lobbying their old colleagues, instituting term limits for federal legislators, and auditing the Federal Reserve. That line drew a rousing shout from acolytes of former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a one-time perennial presidential candidate whose libertarian following has picked up with Paul's son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, right where it left off. Cruz knows that he must appeal to that subset of the Republican Party, which opposes government surveillance programs as well as centralized control of the U.S. money supply. He asked everyone in the audience with a cell phone to 'please leave them on. I want to make sure President Obama hears everything I have to say.' But the Republican party's more traditional conservatives are his meat and potatoes crowd. Leading off the first day of the CPAC convention, he nearly brought a giant ballroom to its feet with a demand that Congress must 'repeal every single word of Obamacare.' Former IRS official Lois Lerner (L) refused Wednesday to answer questions from Congress about the tea party targeting scandal; Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick Toomey (R) said Thursday that Americans 'need to stand up to a president who don't think the laws of America apply to him' Piggybacking on conservative disgust with the Obama administration's steady stream of alterations to the Affordable Care Act's legislated series of deadlines, Cruz took a direct pot-shot at the occupant of the Oval Office. 'If you have a president who is picking and choosing which laws to follow and which laws to ignore, you no longer have a president,' said Cruz. Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick Toomey followed him at the podium with a similar slam. 'We need to stand up to a president who don't think the laws of America apply to him,' Toomey told the crowd. CPAC's attendees are disproportionately young, with College Republicans chapters and church youth groups appearing Thursday morning by the hundreds. 'Millions have lost hope,' Cruz told them, 'because under president Obama, the American dream is harder and harder to achieve. ... If you were to sit down and design a plan to hammer the living daylights out of young people, you couldn't do better than the Obama economic plan.'","Cruz is a Texas senator and likely presidential candidate .

An Asperger's syndrome sufferer who smothered his 91-year-old father to death before calmly feeding his cat then taking a shower has been jailed for life. Robert Cordingley, 57, from Bradford, admitted to murdering his father, George, in January by covering his face with a pillow wrapped in a bin liner. He then wandered to a police station to confess his crime but found it closed and went to a supermarket car park to find a uniformed officer. Cordingly's father, a widower who had been a well-known motorbike competitor, was found dead in a bedroom of the house he had shared with his son for 57 years. Cordingley, who was his father’s sole carer, had previously been diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, a form of autism. Newcastle Crown Court heard that after killing his father he fed his cat and had a shower. The court also heard that there was evidence that suggested his father had begun to suffer from dementia. Mr Justice McCombe said: 'This is a very tragic and unusual case. 'The deceased was 91-years-old when he died and he had lived with the defendant for his whole life. 'There is evidence that he began to suffer from dementia but no help was sought. 'The defendant cared for his father by writing him notes to tell him where his food was and helped him prepare for the day. 'But a growing frustration was present with the defendant which led him to taking the decision to end his father’s life.' Carpark confession: Newcastle Crown Court heard that Cordingley then went to a police station to confess, but it was closed, so he approached police officers in a supermarket car park and told them he had murdered his father . The court heard that Cordingley’s condition led to poor judgment in finding a solution to his situation. Detective Inspector Steve Snow, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'It is hard to imagine what must have been going through Robert Cordingley’s mind when he ultimately decided to end his own father’s life. 'The evidence suggested that this was not a sophisticated plan, but one seemingly prompted out of desperation. 'A thorough and professional investigation was undertaken which clearly presented the facts and culminated in a guilty plea. 'Cordingley will now have to reflect on his decision, not only to take another life, but to subsequently ruin his own.'","Robert Cordingley, from Bradford, admitted murdering his father, George, in January by covering his face with a pillow wrapped in a bin liner .

ff66b69e73de7ff8c9f2a1fb5bc4ad3d09dbc7fe,"New York (CNN) -- Several unions endorsed the two-week-old Occupy Wall Street movement and plan to join the protesters' street theater in New York on Wednesday, labor leaders said. ""It's really simple. These young people on Wall Street are giving voice to many of the problems that working people in America have been confronting over the last several years,"" Larry Hanley, international president of the Amalgamated Transit Union, which has 20,000 member in the New York area, told CNN. ""These young people are speaking for the vast majority of Americans who are frustrated by the bankers and brokers who have profited on the backs of hard-working people,"" Hanley added in a statement. ""While we battle it out day after day, month after month, the millionaires and billionaires on Wall Street sit by -- untouched -- and lecture us on the level of our sacrifice."" Contribute your images, video and words to CNN's coverage . Transport Workers Union Local 100 spokesman Jim Gannon said the Occupy Wall Street movement, which denounces social inequities in the financial system and draws inspiration from the Arab Spring revolutions in Africa and the Middle East, has advanced issues that unions typically support. ""Their goals are our goals,"" Gannon said. ""They brought a spotlight on issues that we've believed in for quite some time now.... Wall Street caused the implosion in the first place and is getting away Scot-free while workers, transit workers, everybody, is forced to pay for their excesses. ""These young folks have brought a pretty bright spotlight,"" Gannon added. ""It's kind of a natural alliance."" Just who are these people? President Michael Mulgrew of the United Federation of Teachers, the sole bargaining agent for most non-supervisory New York City public teachers with 200,000 members, said he was ""proud"" to support the Occupy demonstrators, who have been camping out in New York and elsewhere across the nation. ""The way our society is now headed it does not work for 99% of people, so when Occupy Wall Street started ... they kept to it and they've been able to create a national conversation that we think should have been going on for years,"" Mulgrew said. The labor officials couldn't provide a projection on how many of their members will take the day off from work Wednesday and join the protests. The demonstrators have bivouacked in the park in New York's Financial District, calling for 20,000 people to flood the area for a ""few months."" The protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag #occupywallstreet on the microblogging site Twitter -- began in July with the launch of a simple campaign website calling for a march and a sit-in at the New York Stock Exchange. Over the past two weeks, demonstrations have addressed various issues, including police brutality, union busting and the economy, the group said. Occupy Wall Street is a leaderless movement made largely of twentysomethings upset with the state of the economy, the state of the war in Afghanistan, the state of the environment, and the state of America and the world in general. View a gallery of high-resolution photos from the protests . In less than three weeks, the movement has become a magnet for countless disaffected Americans at a time when an overwhelming majority of U.S. adults say the country's on the wrong track. Occupy protests have been held in Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle and Boston. Occupy Wall Street and its offshoots have clear strains of liberal economic populism -- a powerful force in U.S. history during various times characterized by growing economic stress. That said, it could be a mistake to label or tie the movement to a specific agenda, said Susan Olzak, a Stanford University sociology professor. ""It's difficult to classify a social protest movement early on in its history,"" Olzak told CNN. ""Clearer goals could eventually emerge, but there's no guarantee."" ""Many movements fizzle out. Others become more organized,"" she said. But ""I think we run a risk (by) taking a snapshot at any one point in time, and trying to categorize the movement in any one way based on that snapshot. The only way to study these protest movements is to follow them over time.""

ff66cfc36f2093af2bf2c3614be8c80f642cc274,"(CNN) -- Three-time champions Germany finished third for the second successive World Cup after coming from behind to defeat Uruguay 3-2 in Port Elizabeth on Saturday night. Sami Khedira headed the winning goal with eight minutes to play as Joachim Low's much-changed team won the bronze-medal match in South Africa. ""Of course we had all hoped for something better, but this match for third place was also a final that we absolutely wanted to win,"" Khedira said, AFP reported. ""At this World Cup we were a very young team and we've put down a marker. But we obviously want to win more in the future."" Thomas Muller put Germany ahead in the 19th minute on his return from suspension after missing the semifinal defeat by Spain, joining the tournament's top scorers with his fifth goal of the competition. Edinson Cavani leveled nine minutes later after Germany's stand-in captain Bastian Schweinsteiger was dispossessed, and two-time champions Uruguay took the lead six minutes after the halftime interval as Diego Forlan also netted his fifth goal with a superb volley. Germany equalized five minutes later when Marcell Jansen headed home after Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera failed to cut out Jerome Boateng's deep cross. Forlan hit the German crossbar with the final play of the match from a stunning free-kick as the South Americans finished the tournament on a losing note. ""Finishing among the top four teams is spectacular,"" he said. ""At the beginning we never thought we'd taste a moment like this. We wanted to finish third, but we'll remember the positives."" Low left captain Philipp Lahm and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer on the substitutes' bench along with four-goal striker Miroslav Klose, who had been struggling with a back injury and missed out on the chance to join Brazil's Ronaldo as the all-time top World Cup scorer on 15 overall. Lahm's replacement Dennis Aogo was lucky not to be sent off for a bad early tackle on Diego Perez, but Germany had the ascendancy as Arne Friedrich headed Mezut Ozil's corner against the Uruguay crossbar in the 10th minute. The 20-year-old Muller made no mistake as he pounced to score the opening goal after Muslera was deceived by Schweinsteiger's swerving shot and could only spill the ball into the German's path. It put the Bayern Munich player, who has represented his country only eight times, on five goals for the tournament along with Spain's David Villa and Wesley Sneijder of the Netherlands. If that duo fail to score in Sunday's final, Muller may win the award for top scorer as -- bizarrely -- assists are taken into account in the case of a tie, and he has three to their one. But Schweinsteiger turned villain soon after when he was dispossessed by Perez, who fed Luis Suarez -- and the Uruguay striker found Cavani with a well-timed pass which left veteran goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt exposed. Suarez, returning from suspension, was booed by large sections of the crowd almost every time he touched the ball due to his deliberate handling on the line against Ghana in the quarterfinals. With rain lashing down, he should have put Uruguay ahead just before halftime but screwed his shot wide of the post. The 36-year-old Butt, whose third and previous international outing was in 2003, did well to deny Cavani and Suarez after the break but could do nothing as Forlan volleyed in a right-wing cross from Egidio Arevalo Rios in the 51st minute. The lead did not last long as Muslera was once again caught out, allowing Jansen a free header after flailing at Boateng's towering right-wing center. Khedira gave 2002 runners-up Germany the lead in the 82nd minute as Uruguay failed to clear Ozil's corner and the midfielder was able to place his header over the despairing Muslera. Substitute Stefan Kiessling should have made it 4-2 but blazed his shot over the bar, then Forlan almost took the match into extra-time when his ferocious free-kick boomed to safety off Butt's bar. The result meant that the octopus which had correctly predicted all of Germany's previous results at the tournament was right once again.","Sami Khedira heads late winner as Germany finish third at World Cup in South Africa .

ff675c4901d57d038886e778c9a2f2534a632cee,"(CNN) -- Topless ladies? That's so passe. The nation's strip clubs are in a period of peak innovation. Portland, Oregon, laid claim to the first vegan strip club, Casa Diablo. The first drive-through strip club, Climax Gentleman's Club, popped up outside of Pittsburgh (it's now defunct). Now Ohio is home to the first beer-brewing nudie bar. Pinups and Pints is located, appropriately enough, in a strip mall outside of Dayton, and according to the Dayton City Paper, it's the first strip club microbrewery in America. Behind the main stage and stripper pole sits the 15-gallon brewing system, where club owner Scott Conrad makes batches of the club's signature suds. He decided to start the club after taking note of the area's growing beer scene -- and discovering that a liquor license was more attainable for a microbrewery. ""I feel I am definitely creating a niche to the market"" Conrad told CNN, adding that he is ""definitely ahead of the curve when it comes to adult entertainment."" Conrad had no brewing experience going into this venture, but with some trial and error in his garage and help from local craft brewer Toxic Brewing, he is getting some positive feedback on the beer and plenty of support from the area's brewing community. He describes Pinup Pale Ale, the club's first and only offering, as very approachable, appealing to Bud drinkers as well as craft beer aficionados. However, don't expect to see huge stainless steel fermentation tanks on the brewery tour quite yet though; brewing the beer is something that Conrad takes seriously. ""You gotta get good before you can get creative,"" he said. Kevin J. Gray assessed the beer for his Dayton City Paper story and noted, ""Pinup Pale Ale was a solid pale ale, a good start on a new system."" Gray told CNN, ""The Dayton beer scene has exploded in the last two years. Prior to 2012, there were no breweries in the area. Now, Pinups and Pints makes the twelfth microbrewery opening in the greater Dayton area in the last two years."" Dancers are still the marquee act at Pinups and Pints, but according to Conrad, more and more customers are coming in to check out the beer. ""Those who normally would not go to traditional clubs are starting to come here to try the brew, plus enjoy the entertainment aspect,"" said K.C., a bartender and server at the club. ""Personally, I really enjoy the fact I get to come to work and watch the process and all of the hard work put into each keg,"" she added. Conrad finds that his main challenge so far is keeping up with the demand for the beer. He puts in many long days brewing in addition to running the club and finds, ""It is a lot of hard work, but I enjoy the challenge."" Exotic dancers, neon lights and small-batch beers are, so far for Pints and Pinups, a combo just bubbling over with success.","Pinups and Pints owner Scott Conrad noticed a beer boom around Dayton .

ff680dda385a9ac9b042dbfddc559819048861f5,"(CNN) -- With more than half a billion eggs recalled and at least 1,300 salmonellosis illnesses linked to eggs in an ongoing investigation this summer, consumers are worried and wondering, ""What went wrong, and what can I do to protect myself and my family?"" We study food safety for a living, so our own family members have been quizzing us about which eggs are safest to buy. Our immediate response to them, and everyone else who has called us at the university for advice, is to recommend they check the recall list and discard implicated eggs or return them to the store for a refund. (Specific brands and other information about the recall can be found at http://www.foodsafety.gov/. ) But, beyond the recall, they also wanted to discuss the broader issue of food safety differences between eggs sold conventionally versus free-range or cage-free eggs. For example, they wanted to know is it really true, as some food activists suggest, that eggs from cage-free chickens are safer? The answer? Not necessarily. However, there are things consumers can do to protect their food. They can learn more about salmonella and related egg-production issues. They can also support legislation, now stalled in the U.S. Senate, that would help the Food and Drug Administration safeguard the nation's food supply. It is important to note that in the current outbreak, the eggs recalled were traced to large, conventional farms in Iowa where hens were likely housed in indoor cages. In recent years, the marketing of free-range eggs has become a popular alternative to conventional eggs. Read more about the debate over industrial vs. free-range farming . The term free-range is often used interchangeably with cage-free. The U.S. Department of Agriculture requires that producers labeling eggs as free-range have demonstrated that the birds were allowed continuous, free access to the outside for more than 51 percent of their lives. Free-range or cage-free eggs are sometimes, but not always, organically produced and/or raised on pasture. But are they safer? We revisited the scientific literature. We found that studies directly comparing the relative safety of free-range, cage-free and conventional eggs are limited, and some of the data are contradictory. For example, a 1994 study in Southern California of a specific salmonella type found only 1 percent  prevalence in caged hens compared with 50 percent prevalence in free-range hens. European researchers have concluded the opposite in their studies, but comparisons between countries are difficult because of factors such as feed and climate. A study of broilers in the U.S. found no difference in salmonella incidents in caged and free-range chickens. These findings suggest to us that more research is needed and that the risk factors for finding salmonella in eggs are far more complex than simply how the chickens were housed. To better understand the problem of salmonella in eggs, it is important to consider where the bacteria comes from in the environment. There are some 2,000 subtypes of salmonella, but the one most commonly found in eggs is called salmonella enteritidis (SE). This bacteria lives in the gut of healthy animals, especially chickens, turkeys, ducks, wild birds and rodents. It can also be carried by flies. The outside of an egg can get contaminated with SE by contact with feces and dirt. The bacteria can spread to the hens through contaminated feed or water, from chicken-to-chicken and via wildlife vectors such as wild birds and rodents. Workers and visitors can also spread the bacteria from one farm to another by carrying it on dirty clothing or their shoes. For more on the egg safety issue, see CNN.com's ""Eatocracy"" blog . Neither conventional, free-range nor cage-free farms are immune to these possible modes of spread. Furthermore, an intriguing and dangerous characteristic of the SE strain is that it can also travel to the chicken's reproductive tract and infect the inside of the egg. This is extremely rare. Only one in every 10,000 to 30,000 supermarket eggs is typically infected with salmonella enteritidis. And only a very small fraction of those results from an inner-egg infection, which can happen regardless of how the chickens are housed or whether the chickens were raised organically. Given the biology of salmonella and its multiple potential modes of spread, we can only conclude that both conventional and free-range/cage-free egg producers must be diligent to protect their eggs from contamination. Neither method of egg farming appears to offer the silver bullet for egg food safety. All types of egg farms should follow best practices during production and handling of the eggs. On July 9, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published the Egg Safety Final Rule, which is expected to ""prevent each year approximately 79,000 cases of food-borne illness and 30 deaths caused by consumption of eggs contaminated with the bacterium Salmonella Enteritidis."" Similar but voluntary programs in California and Pennsylvania have already dramatically improved the safety of eggs in those states. Furthermore, SB 510, the Food Safety Modernization Act  that's awaiting Senate action would increase the likelihood of success in controlling SE in eggs by providing the FDA with the authority necessary to enforce the food safety standards and recalls. Finally, it is important to remember that no matter how carefully eggs are produced and handled, or regulated, it is impossible to guarantee that a raw egg is free of salmonella or other harmful bacteria. Prevention should be from the farm to the fork. Consumers can protect themselves by: . -- Always buying eggs from a refrigerated case and choosing eggs with clean, uncracked shells. -- Keeping eggs refrigerated at 45° F (7° C) or colder at all times. -- Washing hands, cooking utensils and food-preparation surfaces with soap and water after contact with raw eggs. -- Cooking eggs until the whites and yolks are firm and eating them promptly. -- Not keeping eggs warm or at room temperature for more than two hours. -- Refrigerating unused or leftover egg-containing foods promptly. -- Avoiding eating raw eggs. -- Using pasteurized shell eggs or pasteurized egg mixtures when home recipes call for uncooked eggs. -- Avoiding restaurant dishes made with raw or undercooked, unpasteurized eggs. Restaurants should use pasteurized eggs in any recipe (such as Hollandaise sauce or Caesar salad dressing) that calls for raw eggs. Do not hesitate to ask your server how the eggs were prepared.

'British intelligence is observing things closely from Cyprus. It's very useful because they find out a great deal,' the official said. 'The British are giving the information to the Turks and the Americans and we are getting it from the Turks.' According to the official, the most valuable intelligence so far has been about the movements of troops loyal to President Assad towards the stricken second city of Aleppo, which is partly controlled by rebels. Early this month FSA fighters had reported that two large columns of government troops were heading towards Aleppo. One was from Latakia on the Mediterranean coast and the other from Damascus, the capital. The fighters did not reveal the source of their intelligence at the time. The official said rebels ambushed troops and a column of more than 40 tanks in a valley near Saraqib, cut them off and destroyed many of them with repeat attacks with rocket-propelled grenades.

The opposition official said rebel forces in Aleppo had also received US satellite imagery, which the Turks had passed on from the CIA. MI6 and the CIA are understood to be tacitly condoning the supply of heavy machineguns from Gulf countries to the rebels. The rebels claim to have shot down at least two helicopters, part of a fleet used by Assad's regime to try and crush the growing rebellion. But they do not have enough to be effective. One diplomat denied that the British were 'facilitating' the supply of heavy machineguns. But he said he could not rule out the possibility that private contractors financed by countries such as Qatar were involved in providing arms. Wealthy families in Qatar and Saudi Arabia are understood to be providing substantial financial support to the rebel forces. Opposition fighters also benefit from the monitoring by British bases of ships along the Syrian coast from countries friendly towards Assad. Britain has officially ruled out giving any covert help to the rebels. It is understood that William Hague, the foreign secretary, has been advised that it would be illegal under international law for Britain to supply weapons directly to any group in Syria, which is covered by a European Union arms embargo.","Disclosure is first indication of Britain playing a .

By the time he and his chow-shepherd mix, Aussie, made it home to Gulfport, Tropical Storm Andrea was thrashing his neighborhood. Just down the street, a tornado touched down, felling a massive 200-year-old cedar tree. ""There were a lot of trees down,"" the hairstylist said Friday morning. ""We're lucky. We're OK."" By 5 p.m. ET, Andrea's heavy rain had moved on, targeting a broad swath of the East Coast. The storm, categorized as a post-tropical cyclone with sustained winds of up to 45 mph, was about 55 miles northeast of Raleigh, North Carolina, and continuing on its predicted path up the Northeast Coast. Forecasters say it's expected to drench 13 states from Georgia to Maine. Meteorologists want everyone in Andrea's path to know this: The storm's biggest danger will probably be flash floods. The National Weather Service offers tips on what to do in a flooding situation. In short, road beds may be washed out under flood waters, so never drive through flooded roadways. At 11 a.m. Friday, the National Hurricane Center said Andrea was packing 45-mph winds and was about 50 miles southwest of Fayetteville, North Carolina, and 90 miles west of Wilmington, North Carolina. Andrea is expected to produce 2 to 4 inches of rain in central and eastern North Carolina. Up to 2 inches are expected over portions of South Carolina. Farther north on Friday, a flood watch area includes Washington, which the National Weather Service predicts could get 6 inches of rain Friday, and New York, where forecasters say 1 to 2 inches of rain an hour could fall at times into Saturday. Even Maine's coast, including Portland, could see as much as 3 inches of rain by the time the weekend is done. Follow the storm on CNN.com's hurricane tracker . As of 8 a.m., Andrea's projected path is similar to that of Tropical Storm Debby nearly a year ago. Debby dumped up to 2 feet of rain onto the low-lying areas, causing extensive flooding in some coastal towns. CNN meteorologists Sean Morris and Ivan Cabrera contributed to this report.","NEW: Now a post-tropical cyclone, Andrea was near Raleigh, North Carolina, at 5 p.m.

Chakvetadze's problems began when she dramatically collapsed on court while leading World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki in a second round match in Dubai. ""When I got sick in Dubai I was in very good shape,"" Chakvetadze told the official WTA website. ""I was finally enjoying the way I was playing. I was feeling the ball great. I had found my game again and was really ready to compete. But then I got sick."" She was to play only three main draw matches in the remainder of the year, slipping to 234 in the rankings, before the illness was diagnosed as an inflammation of the inner year which caused dizziness and effected her balance. ""I'm 100 per cent healthy now. It doesn't bother me anymore. I'm completely over it."" Former World No.1 Safin elected to Russian federal parliament . While away from tennis, the 24-year-old dabbled in politics, standing for the Right Cause Party in December's elections. But with her party polling less than one per cent in the election, for now Chakvetadze's political ambitions are on hold. ""I met some new people and really enjoyed myself. It was great to try myself in a different world. ""While I will do something if my party asks me to, right now my priority is sport. I spend my days on the tennis court. Tennis comes first for me,"" she said. Chakvetadze will head to Hobart in Tasmania for the first tournament of 2012 ahead of a tilt at the Australian Open later in January. She reached her career-high ranking in 2007 when she won four tournaments and made the semifinals of the U.S. Open. But in December of that year she suffered a horrifying ordeal when her home was burgled and the intervening years have been marked by a series of injuries and loss of form.

Colin Burbridge, 45, called a local workman when his central heating system stopped working just five months after being installed at his company's office in Littleport, Cambridgeshire. But after opening up the boiler, the pair were stunned to find it was infested with thousands of bees. Hive: Colin Burbridge, 45, was shocked to discover a swarm of 15,000 bees were using his boiler as their hive . Mr Burbridge, who immediately fled the office after being stung, was forced to call on local beekeeper Stuart Palmer, 41, and his 39-year-old wife, Carol, to tackle the infestation. Donning protective white suits and parcel tape around their wrists and ankles, the couple managed to safely remove the colony by encouraging them into a nucleus box. Today, Mr Burbridge, who runs the heating engineering firm M8trix, said he had not noticed the bees' buzzing because the boiler in his office's kitchen area had 'sealed in' the noise. 'I was standing next to the boiler when it was opened,' he said. 'I got stung straight away and just fled the building. Infestation: Mr Burbridge called a local workman when his central heating system at his company's office stopped working. But after opening up the boiler, the pair were stunned to find it was infested with bees . Removal: Local beekeeper Stuart Palmer, 41, and his wife, Carol, 39 were called upon to remove the insects . 'It is a new boiler and all the noise is sealed in so I didn't hear any buzzing or anything like that. 'We are an engineering firm as well so you can imagine there is a lot of noise.' Mr Burbridge added that the swarm of insects had destroyed his £2,000 boiler, which he might have to pay for out of his own pocket. 'We are not covered by our insurers on this because it is an ""insect infestation"",' he said. 'It was a new boiler and cost about £2,000 but hopefully we won't have to pay that out again.' Office: Mr Burbridge, who runs the heating engineering firm M8trix (pictured) in Littleport, Cambridgeshire, said he had not noticed the bees' buzzing because the boiler in his office's kitchen area had 'sealed in' the noise . Taking them away: Mr Palmer tips some of the insects into a box, while hundreds of others are on the floor . Mrs Palmer who had passed a beekeeping course just a week before the infestation was discovered, said the swarm of bees had likely entered the boiler through an outside vent. 'There is a vent at the back of the boiler that goes outside and that must be how they managed to get in,' she said. 'I asked for a bit of advice from more experienced beekeepers. They advised that we cut out the comb from inside the boiler and encourage the bees to move away. 'Fortunately, we were able to attract the vast majority into a nucleus box and they are now sitting happily in our garden waiting to be transferred to their new hive. 'They had basically made their own hive. They were happy there until we came and got them out. 'Having a suit on and parcel tape around my ankles and wrists gives you that little sense of bravery.' She added that after she and her husband had left M8trix, staff had been left with a huge clean-up job on their hands. 'There was a lot of honey in there so it was a bit of a sticky job,' she said.","Colin Burbridge, 45, was puzzled when central heating stopped working .

The 23-year-old rapper, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested after a Los Angeles police officer pulled over a car in which he was a passenger, police spokeswoman Rosario Herrera told CNN. Soulja Boy was booked into a San Fernando Valley jail, but freed after posting a $35,000 bond Wednesday afternoon, according to jail records. The traffic stop happened on a residential street in the Granada Hills area of the San Fernando Valley at 4 a.m., Herrera said.

Police said they found a ""felony amount"" of marijuana and firearms in his rented SUV.

ff68cb11e23d3545477d55e3d3339ae94072b4ff,"Washington (CNN) -- In what one member of Congress called ""a charade,"" a couple that showed up at President Obama's first state dinner -- uninvited, the White House claims -- declined to answer questions surrounding the event before a House committee Wednesday. Under questioning from House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, and others, Tareq Salahi repeated over and over again, ""On the advice of counsel, I respectfully assert my right to remain silent and decline to answer your question."" The Salahis' attorney notified the committee in December that because of a pending investigation by federal prosecutors, they would not answer questions about how they gained entry to the White House on November 24, despite not being on the guest list to attend that night's state dinner for the prime minister of India. In a brief statement that opened the often-contentious hearing, Salahi chastised the committee for requiring the couple to appear despite having been told the two would invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if subpoenaed. That, he alleged, is against the ethical rules of the Washington bar. He incensed some committee members by reiterating the couple's respect for U.S. troops, the Secret Service and the president. ""You have shown effrontery here,"" said Daniel Lungren, R-California. He called it ""an abomination"" that the Salahis would invoke the name of those in uniform ""and suggest that somehow what you do provides support to them."" ""The Constitution protects fools,"" Lungren said. ""The Constitution protects stupidity. The Constitution protects errant thought. Thank God it does."" ""This was not a hearing looking for information,"" the couple's attorney, Stephen Best, told reporters after the hearing. ""This was an opportunity for a public flogging."" ""I think today's procedure is a charade,"" Rep. Mark Souder, R-Indiana, said in the hearing, referring to the Salahis' refusal to answer questions. Other committee members also lambasted the couple, alleging they put their own desire for celebrity before the security of the president and are wasting the committee's time and taxpayers' money. ""I don't respect your right to take the Fifth Amendment. Not at all,"" Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-New Jersey, told the couple. ""Were you there?"" he asked Salahi, referring to the dinner. When Salahi began, ""On the advice ..."" Pascrell interrupted him, asking, ""Are you here right now? You gonna get an answer from your attorney on that?"" Pascrell noted the committee had offered to allow the couple to speak behind closed doors. After conferring with his attorney, Salahi said, ""Yes, but you didn't offer us any legal protection."" Salahi's wife, Michaele, also invoked her Fifth Amendment right under questioning by committee members, but replied, ""yes,"" when asked if she would return to testify after the investigation has concluded. Asked by Thompson whether the state dinner appearance was part of a ""reality TV stunt,"" Tareq Salahi said the couple was under a non-disclosure agreement and ""should not discuss matters related to the television matter."" The Salahis contend they were told they could attend the program to honor India's prime minister, but the White House says they were not invited and were not on the guest list for the exclusive affair. Best said after the hearing the couple received ""representations that they relied upon"" that they were invited guests. Two Secret Service investigators were privy to this information from a person who knows the Salahis, he said. ""This was not a stunt, and they committed no criminal act."" There was no connection to any reality TV show, he said, and the Salahis were not seeking publicity. The couple has turned down multiple offers from the media to be ""rewarded handsomely,"" he added. ""Whatever the real story is, it's on the other side of the gates of the White House, not with the Salahis,"" Best said. ""They thought they were invited. ... If it was a misunderstanding, it was a misunderstanding caused by representatives of the government."" Tareq Salahi also noted in his opening statement that the couple's attorneys have offered to provide information to the committee, but that offer was declined by Thompson's staff. ""Those offers are not satisfactory,"" Thompson said. ""These lawyers were not at the state dinner and have no firsthand knowledge of the facts."" Tareq Salahi also said the couple has provided phone records, e-mails and other documentary evidence to the committee. There also was criticism of the White House in Wednesday's hearing. Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said the White House ""continues to stonewall"" and will not allow social secretary Desiree Rogers to testify on the security breach. Obama press secretary Robert Gibbs has said that allowing a White House staff member to testify before a congressional committee would violate the Constitution's separation of powers. ""I don't know what the White House is trying to hide,"" King said. ""Obviously, something went wrong, and it originated with the White House, not the Secret Service."" Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, in previous testimony before the committee, took responsibility for the security breach, acknowledging that ""appropriate procedures were not followed."" Rep. Charles Dent, R-Pennsylvania, said Wednesday he thought it was ""unfortunate"" that Sullivan ""had to take all that grief from us."" ""I hold you responsible for it,"" he told the Salahis. ""Your actions ... made a mockery of this country, a mockery of our security,"" Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, told the couple. ""I'm saddened, and I'm disappointed, and I'm outraged."" Best reiterated afterward the Salahis do not want the events surrounding the dinner to detract from the ""extraordinary institution"" of the Secret Service. ""They are Americans,"" he said. ""They are proud Americans.""","Tareq and Michaele Salahi decline to answer questions at congressional hearing .

'Rogue trader': Gregory Allnutt dodged more than £420,000 in VAT selling cut-price electrical goods over eBay . A stay-at-home father who dodged tax on £4.7million-worth of electrical goods he sold on eBay was jailed today. Gregory Allnutt, who has a seven-year-old son, avoiding paying more than £420,000 in VAT. He raked in £4,000 a month over three years selling cut price electrical goods on the internet. The 40-year-old, from Croydon, set up a company called Shapewise to sell nutrition products from the comfort of his home. But instead he bought tax-free electrical goods from the European Union through online site Pixmania before selling them on for a profit. Instead of declaring the sales and adding on the price of VAT, he undercut his rivals and maximised his profits. He continued to file 'nil' accounts between 2007 and 2010, falsely stating he had earned no money. Allnutt, whose wife was paid £7,000 each month as well an extra allowance for school fees and a company car, spent the cash on a luxury car and two motorbikes. He did not realise he was obliged to pay VAT on the goods he sold, the court was told. But he was informed by his accountant at a meeting in 2007 that he owed £67,000. Scam: The father of one was caught by HMRC inspector in 2010 - three years after he had been told he was not paying the VAT that he should . Instead of turning himself in, he continued with the scam until December 2010 when he was caught by inspectors from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. Prosecutor David Hewitt said: 'It wasn't until 2007 that he realised he wasn't paying it properly. 'At that point he was in too deep and he realised he was stuck. He realised if he charged VAT he wasn't able to compete. 'He did try it legitimately but he couldn't make the system work because he couldn't make enough money.' The court also heard his VAT number was eventually automatically de-registered by HMRC after he failed to file any accounts. But unperturbed, he re-registered and continued trading, later changing the company name to Specialist Electricals. Lavish lifestyle: The Croydon-based stay-at-home father was able to afford a luxury car and two motorbikes using the profits from his dealings . 'It was a simple fraud in effect,' said Mr Hewitt. 'What had been discovered was that records showed that in fact over the period that the registration had been in place Pixmania had sold goods to this defendant of more than £4.7million. 'Therefore the total amount of VAT which he avoided was £420,000.' Sentencing him to 20 months in prison, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said: 'Being aware of your obligations to pay VAT you carried out a thoroughly dishonest scheme to avoid paying VAT. 'You avoided £429,000 of VAT and because you were able to offer the goods at prices below those a trader paying VAT could you have prevented honest tax paying traders competing with you. 'You claim that you had become trapped into the scheme when you discovered that you owed £67,000 to the revenue. 'That should have led you to stop your trading altogether but you decided to carry on in full knowledge that you were doing what was wrong and that you owed money to the revenue.' Allnutt admitted 12 counts of fraudulent evasion.","Gregory Allnutt bought tax-free goods from EU .

ff6a3e969d365ec27ae31a958371b7c30de332ba,"(CNN) -- Quoting Ezekiel 25:17 from ""Pulp Fiction"" will likely get you laughed out of Sunday school class. That's because the Bible verse, as recited by Samuel L. Jackson's character, Jules Winnfield, doesn't actually exist. In the film, Winnfield speaks these words to people before he kills them: ""The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."" The actual Bible verse says, ""I will carry out great vengeance on them and punish them in my wrath. Then they will know that I am the Lord, when I take vengeance on them.'"" Scripture isn't the only thing writer-director Quentin Tarantino took creative liberties with for the film that opened in theaters on October 14, 1994. In honor of ""Pulp Fiction's"" 20th anniversary, here are 20 fun facts about the movie that still reigns as one of the greats: . 1. Vincent Vega's trips to the bathroom . Potty breaks are bad news in this film. Whenever John Travolta's character, Vincent Vega, takes a powder, tragedy occurs. During his three bathroom breaks, Mia Wallace (played by Uma Thurman) overdoses, the restaurant where he and Jules are dining is held up, and Bruce Willis' Butch Coolidge gets the drop on him. 2. F'ed up . The F-word is used 265 times in the movie. Go ahead and count it. 3. The notebook . Fueled by the money he had made from his film ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the deal he had for ""Pulp Fiction,"" Tarantino took off to Amsterdam to write the latter. According to Vanity Fair, ""He bought school notebooks and declared about one of them, like a modern-day Hemingway, 'This is the notebook in which I am going to write Pulp Fiction.' "" He ended up filling several notebooks. 4. The Honda . Tarantino got a lot of use out of the Honda Civic that Butch drives in the film. It's the same car Pam Grier drives in the title role of ""Jackie Brown,"" and appears in a parking lot scene in ""Kill Bill: Volume 2."" 5. Oops with the coat . At the beginning of the now-infamous overdose scene, Mia is wearing Vincent's coat. Moments later she goes to light a cigarette and is no longer wearing it. The coat magically appears back on her once the cigarette is lit. 6. Robert Redford could have starred . Ronnie Yeskel, the film's casting director, told Flavorwire that unlike on ""Reservoir Dogs,"" Hollywood agencies ""were pitching Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman and Bruce, Bruce Willis -- just the biggest names in the business that you could imagine."" ""And we're sitting there in these rooms with all these suits, and they all look alike, and we're like kids in a candy store,"" Yeskel said. ""We couldn't believe they were pitching these people to us."" 7. Or Ellen . Ellen DeGeneres tried out for the role of Jody, the pierced face wife of Vincent's drug dealer, that ultimately went to Rosanna Arquette. 8. Kathy Griffin made it in as did ... Blink and you may miss her, but comedian Kathy Griffin appears in the scene where bad guy Marsellus Wallace and Butch collide. Griffin has said she used to date Tarantino. Steve Buscemi, who now stars in ""Boardwalk Empire,"" also made a cameo as the Buddy Holly waiter at Jack Rabbit Slim's. 9. Tricky camera work . The scene where Travolta's Vincent plunges a needle into the chest of Thurman's Mia to revive her from an overdose using adrenaline was filmed with Travolta pulling the needle out of her and then the film was run backward. 10. Jackson was convincing . Producer Richard Gladstein told Vanity Fair that when Jackson did his second audition for his role he showed up with a burger and fries -- key props in one of the film's pivotal scenes. The actor proceeded to consume the meal so menacingly that Gladstein said, ""I thought that this guy was going to shoot a gun right through my head."" 11. On drugs . One of Tarantino's friends, a recovering heroin addict, advised Travolta on how best to portray a man riding that horse. He told the actor that getting drunk on tequila while relaxing in a hot bath would closely approximate a heroin high without him actually having to do the drug. 12. That bad wallet . The director didn't have to look far for one of the film's most memorable props. Jules' wallet, which had ""Bad Mother F****r"" written on the front of it, actually belonged to Tarantino. 13. The watch transporter . When Captain Koons (Christopher Walken) tells a young Butch the story about the gold watch that was a family heirloom, he refers to a soldier named Winocki who transported it. Joe Winocki was the name of a character in the 1943 film ""Air Force,"" directed by Howard Hawks, one of Tarantino's personal heroes. 14. ""The Wolf"" No one else could have played the man who specialized in messy cleanups: Tarantino reportedly wrote the character of Winston ""The Wolf"" Wolfe specifically for Harvey Keitel. 15. The same pie . If Fabienne's line, ""Any time of day is a good time for pie,"" sounds familiar, it should. The character of Alabama says the same thing in another Tarantino film, ""True Romance."" 16. What's in the case? There have been countless theories about what was in that mysterious briefcase that Jules and Vinnie had to protect -- with everything from gold to Marsellus' soul being suggested. But Tarantino has said in interviews that it's whatever fans choose it to be, though he has also had fun with fans promising a ""reveal."" 17. Keeping it in the family . Travolta's character, Vincent Vega, is the brother of Vic Vega, aka Mr. Blonde, from Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs."" Michael Madsen played the character in that film. 18. The meaning of the Band-Aid . Marsellus sports a Band-Aid on the back of his neck for a reason: It covers up a scar actor Ving Rhames had. 19. The dance trophy . The audience is led to believe that Vincent and Mia won the dance contest at the Jack Rabbit Slim's restaurant. But late in the film, when Butch is returning to get his watch, there's a radio bulletin about the trophy having been stolen. 20. The Gimp had a wife . ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Julia Sweeney had a bit role in ""Pulp Fiction"" as a junkyard owner and The Wolf's breakfast date, Raquel.

Aljaz Bedene is the 25-year-old Slovenian settled in Welwyn Garden City with a pop star girlfriend who is a protégé of the renowned music producer and tennis nut Jeff Wayne. The fast-rising world No 116 hopes to receive his passport and represent Great Britain this year, but for now must concentrate on his first round against the world No 1 and outright favourite for the Australian Open. Aljaz Bedene, who hopes to represet Great Britain, will face world No 1 Novak Djokovic on Tuesday . Slovenia tennis star Bedene lives with his pop star fiancee in Hertfordshire, England . The season's first Grand Slam was due to begin on Monday morning, with Murray beginning his campaign against Indian qualifier Yuki Bhambri. James Ward, Kyle Edmund and Heather Watson play on day two, and then there is Bedene. Since 2008 he has lived in an area more associated with producing outstanding golfers, such as Sir Nick Faldo and Ian Poulter, and he now sees himself as part of the Hertfordshire scene. He has even represented the county at tennis, under the non-playing captaincy of Wayne – best-known for his War of the Worlds musical adaptation – who works with Bedene's girlfriend Kimalie, another who seeks British citizenship. At present the player is not known much beyond the tennis cognoscenti, although he is reckoned to have top 50 potential and his ranking is falsely low due to injury problems sustained last year. His profile would skyrocket with an upset of Djokovic, who might be more vulnerable than usual as he has been battling a virus and has had his preparations for this event disrupted. Bedene – an athletic baseliner who has already been in the world's top 75 - has had an immigration lawyer pressing for a passport for two years, but is trying to ignore any distractions as he prepares to face the formidable Serb. Bedene faces an extremely difficult Australian Open tie against Novak Djokovic . Djokovic's preparations have been disrupted as he has been battling against a virus . 'I haven't been checking up on it too much here because I need to focus,' he said on Sunday. 'I really want to play for Great Britain, that's my life goal actually. I don't know everything about it but it looks good so far and I'm looking forward to the next few years. 'I'm paying taxes in England so that's a plus, I guess. I live with my fiancee. I have a friend as well, Jeff Wayne, who is trying to help Kimalie, which is her artist's name in her music career. 'So we have both been based there for our careers and I think that's a big thing. We are both enjoying it there. I'm planning to live there after my career as well. It's just a nice place to live.' He confirmed that he would try to appeal against a new rule that came into effect this month preventing players who have already represented another country switching their allegiance in the Davis Cup. His problem is that he has been on the Slovenian team three times, the last occasion being three years ago. The potential objections from someone like long standing Davis Cup stalwart James Ward would be understandable on that basis. James Ward may object against Bedene switching from Slovenia to represent Britain at the Davis Cup .","Aljaz Bedene is hoping to represent Great Britain later this year .

Endurance exercises for those hoping to win places in the SAS and SBS have been made easier following a damning report by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into the deaths of three soldiers who collapsed during a 20-mile march over the Brecon Beacons last year. The move has sparked fury among officers and troops in the tough fighting units, who fear the calibre of soldiers winning places will decline, lives will be put at risk and the regiments’ fearsome reputation will be undermined. Test of endurance: The SAS has been ordered to soften their gruelling entry tests by the Government's Health and Safety watchdog. Above, soldiers take a breather on a 50-mile march over the Brecon Beacons last year . Victims: The changes follow a damning report by the Health and Safety Executive into the deaths of Corporal James Dunsby (right), 31, Trooper Edward Maher (left), 31, and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, last July . Until now potential recruits would . have to go without food if rations ran low and find streams if they ran . out of water – skills SAS officers say are essential to survival in . combat. Candidates who had to be ‘rescued’ automatically failed. But . new rules, to meet HSE demands, include providing extra rations, giving . troops time to rest on marches, making sure safe drinking water  is . always available and introducing marshals to help stragglers cross the . finishing line. Tragic: The three soldiers, including L/Cpl Roberts (pictured), collapsed during a 20-mile march over the South Wales mountain range . In . the Brecon Beacons, recruits are expected to march up and down the . 2,900ft Pen Y Fan. Instructors use two routes, the steep and . inaccessible ‘Goat Route’ and the easier partly cobbled ‘Granny Route’. Now, . if candidates are struggling on the climb in adverse weather, they will . use the ‘Granny Route’ to avoid any emergency arising. And in the jungle section of the two-venue test, held in Brunei, if several recruits suffer heat exhaustion marches will be shortened or cancelled so they can recover and receive medical treatment. SAS sources say the pass rate has more than doubled since the changes were made in January ahead of the winter selection course. The Ministry of Defence refused to confirm this. The Mail on Sunday has been told that on the winter 2013 course, only 20 candidates out of 250 were successful. Of the 250 who started the winter 2014 course, 46 passed. Last night, an SAS source said: ‘This caused a massive spike in the number of candidates completing the marches inside the time limits and thereby qualifying to serve in Special Forces units. ‘The SAS and SBS cannot afford to accept candidates whose fitness, mental aptitude or military skills are in any doubt. The inspectors have no idea of the risks to soldiers’ lives when they’re in battle should training be compromised. ‘So even though the SAS and SBS have been struggling to fully staff their squadrons in recent years, there is no benefit to having a larger pool of guys as a result of the last course. Question marks will remain over their capability.’ The HSE imposed the changes following the deaths of Corporal James Dunsby, 31, Trooper Edward Maher, 31, and Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, after an endurance march last July. Tough: In the Brecon Beacons (pictured), recruits are expected to march up and down the 2,900ft Pen Y Fan.

Cpl Dunsby died two weeks later from multiple organ failure. It was the biggest loss of life in the history of SAS selection. Afterwards, HSE inspector Sarah Baldwin-Jones launched an inquiry. In October, she sent a Crown Improvement Notice, a document stating that the selection courses breached the Health and Safety at Work Act. The notice casts blame on Special Forces instructors. Scene: SAS sources say the pass rate has more than doubled since the changes were made in January ahead of the winter course. The Ministry of Defence refused to confirm this.

The inspector added that as the emergency unfolded, with at least six recruits showing signs of severe heat sickness, these instructors ‘failed to review risk assessments’.

The HSE confirmed last night that regulators had accepted new risk assessments and safety measures presented by the military.

ff6c8a4ec330c868fb663e75e89c9530267ed67c,"Medical marijuana advocates are hoping state governments can succeed where their efforts have failed by asking federal authorities to reclassify pot as a drug with medical use. Shortly before Christmas, Colorado became the fourth state to ask the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to reclassify marijuana as a narcotic in the same league as heavyweight painkillers including oxycodone. The governors of Washington and Rhode Island filed a formal petition with the agency in November, and Vermont signed onto that request shortly afterward. All four are among the sixteen states and the District of Columbia that have laws on the books that allow the medical use of marijuana, even though the drug remains illegal under federal law. Meanwhile, federal authorities have asserted their power by raiding dispensaries in states including California and Washington. Supporters say the public is on their side, and the state requests show the feds are increasingly isolated on the issue. But they acknowledge it's still an uphill battle. ""I don't think that we're going to see to much change in Washington's position on this until public opinion and state-level support reaches a little bit higher a tipping point,"" said Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the D.C.-based Marijuana Policy Project. The DEA said it would ""reply accordingly,"" but noted that similar petitions had been rejected before. DEA spokeswoman Barbara Carreno told CNN that the agency gives ""great respect"" to state governments, but their requests would get ""the same attention as a petition from a medical group or anything else."" Marijuana is listed as a Schedule I drug by the DEA, meaning it's dangerous and has no medical use. Medical marijuana advocates, including the states that have petitioned the agency, say it should be listed under Schedule II, comparing it to other prescription painkillers that have a high potential for abuse. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration restated its opposition to medical marijuana, saying ""no sound scientific studies"" support its use. State laws authorizing it ""are inconsistent with efforts to ensure that medications undergo the rigorous scientific scrutiny of the FDA approval process,"" it added. But in their November petition, Washington Gov. Christine Gregoire and Rhode Island's Lincoln Chafee argued that ""the vast majority of modern research"" has found marijuana useful for treating patients with glaucoma, for relieving the nausea suffered by cancer patients in chemotherapy and for relieving symptoms of degenerative nerve diseases. They cite a 2001 study by the National Academy of Sciences that recommended research into the ""potential therapeutic value"" of cannabis, though it warned that smoking pot was a ""crude"" method ""that also delivers harmful substances."" ""Since the last FDA review in 2006, the scientific process has identified and clarified even more of the therapeutic effects of cannabis through ongoing research and assessment of available data,"" wrote Gregoire, a Democrat, and Chafee, a former Republican-turned-independent. ""This petition presents this further evidence. It is now time for the DEA to reschedule the substance."" The Obama administration says it is willing to support research, but has taken a stiff position against medical marijuana. In October, in response to online petitions, White House drug czar Gil Kerlikowske said marijuana ""is not a benign drug."" Medical marijuana group sues Obama administration . ""Like many, we are interested in the potential marijuana may have in providing relief to individuals diagnosed with certain serious illnesses. That is why we ardently support ongoing research into determining what components of the marijuana plant can be used as medicine,"" Kerlikowske wrote. ""To date, however, neither the FDA nor the Institute of Medicine have found smoked marijuana to meet the modern standard for safe or effective medicine for any condition."" Carreno said petitions to reschedule a drug take years to review. The DEA does its own analysis, then refers the requests to the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, which review their own research. ""Then they send recommendations back to us, and based on the recommendation we get, we make a decision,"" she said. Critics call medical marijuana a ""Trojan horse"" for legalizing the drug entirely, and federal authorities mounted a string of high-profile raids in California, Washington and Montana in 2011. The Justice Department says it isn't targeting patients who are in ""clear and unambiguous compliance"" with state laws. In October's raids in California, prosecutors said they were targeting organizations that had become large-scale commercial traffickers, operating beyond the limits of state law. In their petition, Gregoire and Chafee said rescheduling was needed because states can't make rules governing medical marijuana ""without putting their employees at risk of violating federal law."" ""From a patient perspective, there's a lot of things up in the air,"" Gregoire spokesman Cory Curtis told CNN. He said the state hopes ""to give them clarity and peace of mind, both in the environment in which they get it and the prescription and dose they get."" A round of federal raids targeted dispensaries in the Seattle area in November, but agents were targeting ""folks who were distributing without a medical purpose,"" Curtis said. Washington allows patients to grow their own marijuana and keep a 60-day supply, which it defines as up to 24 ounces. Patients and designated health-care providers can keep ""collective gardens."" Rhode Island allows patients to grow up to 12 plants and possess up to 2.5 ounces of pot for their own use, as long as a doctor has certified that it may alleviate symptoms and the potential risks don't outweigh the benefits. It also allows ""compassion centers"" to cultivate and dispense marijuana, as long as it stays within those limits for each patient. In Colorado, legislation passed in 2010 allows state regulators to keep a tight rein on dispensaries and required them to request reclassification from the DEA. ""As long as there is a divergence in state and federal law, there is a lack of certainty necessary to provide safe access for patients with serious medical conditions,"" Barbara Brohl, the executive director of Colorado's Department of Revenue, wrote in a December 22 letter to DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart. Since the law went into effect, more than 700 people have applied for licenses to sell medical marijuana, said Mark Couch, a spokesman for Brohl's office. The state collected about $5 million in sales taxes in the last fiscal year, which ended in June -- a tiny fraction of the state's $8 billion general fund, he said. Fox said the state's requests to reclassify the drug ""could and certainly should"" give the states some breathing room, ""but I really don't think it will."" ""I think that it's not going to provide any real tangible benefits immediately,"" he said. But it if succeeds, ""It will definitely bring the federal government more in line with currently accepted science."" In the meantime, ""There's no reason for the federal government to be wasting resources going after medical marijuana providers,"" he said.","Four states have asked federal officials to reclassify marijuana .
Governors say they can't set rules without risking violations of U.S. law .
Advocates say there's no reason to keep busting medical pot providers .

An increasingly confident Barack Obama has returned to his rhetoric of 2008, presenting himself as a challenger to the status quo who will change politics and railing against ‘lobbyists and special interests’ in Washington. Speaking before 10,000 people in the Democratic heartland of Boulder, Colorado, Obama, his voice hoarse, delivered a fiery 36-minute speech designed to whip up his base of voters and rekindle some of the magic of four years ago ahead of Tuesday's election. Scroll down for video . His youngest fan? Obama high-fives a young girl while meeting with supporters after speaking at a campaign event at Franklin County Fairgrounds in Hilliard, Ohio, today . Must win: Mitt Romney needs to take Virginia and Florida . Obama has edged ahead in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls by just 0.1 per cent and appears to have an advantage in the crucial swing state of Ohio. He is very much in contention too in Virginia and Florida, which his opponent Mitt Romney must win. But Obama is campaigning in Wisconsin, Colorado and Nevada, states he won easily in 2008 and which hoped would have been in the bag by now. If Ohio, Florida and Virginia fall, his aides calculate, these states might save him. ‘Back in 2008, when we talked about . change, I told you I wasn’t just talking about changing Presidents.  I . wasn’t just talking about changing parties,’ Obama said in Boulder. ‘I . was talking about changing our politics. ‘I ran because the voices of the American people - your voices - had been shut out of our democracy for way too long by lobbyists and special interests, and politicians who believe that compromise is a dirty word and who would say anything to win office, and do anything to stay in office.’ Change, again: Barack Obama brought up memories of the previous election campaign . Plans: Obama said 'the future doesn't have many lobbyists' Despite having included many former . lobbyists in his administration, Obama said: ‘The future doesn’t have . lobbyists. They’ll never have as many lobbyists as the vested interests. Never have as many lobbyists as the past does.’ Lobbyists, however, have been frequent and repeated visitors to the Obama White House. According to the Washington Post, Tim Hannegan, who lists Taser International as a client has been to the White House more than 30 times under Obama. Bill Samuel, lobbyist for the AFL-CIO, has been by more than 50 times. Michael Taylor, a lobbyist for the Monsanto corporation, has been 25 times. Former Senator. Chris Dodd, a lobbyists for the Motion Picture Association of America, has been more than a dozen times. But the populist rhetoric was lapped up by the crowd as Obama promised 100,000 new ‘math and science teachers’ and training for two million workers. Aiming high: Obama pledged training for two million workers and more teachers . Not the status quo: Romney said he was the real agent of change . Obama sought to seize back the mantle of change from Romney, who has recently claimed he is the real candidate of change and Obama represents the status quo in Washington. ‘I know what real change looks like, because I fought for it,’ Obama said. ‘I've got the scars to prove it. You have, too. And after all that we've been through together, Colorado, we sure as heck can't give up now.’ The argument is unlikely to persuade many swing voters, who have become jaded after four years of high unemployment, soaring debt and partisan gridlock in Washington. But it is a message that resonates among diehard Democrats, who Obama desperately needs to go to the polls. Obama also looked back to the Bush years, blaming his predecessor for the mess that he had spent ‘four years cleaning up’ and harking back to President Bill Clinton’s time in the White House from 1993 to 2001. ‘We know the ideas that worked,’ Obama said in Green Bay, Wisconsin. ‘We also know the ideas that don't work. Because in the eight years after Bill Clinton left office, his policies were reversed.’ Obama speaking in Boulder, Colorado .","President told 10,000 in Colorado that the future does not hold many lobbyists .

Selfridges has reported aN increase in sales of insect delicacies after the World Health Organisation suggested that eating bugs could be the solution to worldwide food shortages. The department store has recorded an 11 per cent increase in sales of Edible's insect-based snacks including Thai Green Curry Crickets, Dark Chocolate Covered Scorpions and BBQ Flavour Worm Crisps. According to the WHO, insects are a more sustainable protein source than other meats. Selfridges has noticed a surge in demand for insect delicacies after the World Health Organisation claimed that eating bugs could help solve worldwide food shortages . The UN's Food and Agricultural Agency says that more than two billion people - 30 per cent of the planet's population - already supplement their diet with insects. A 200-page report, released at a news conference at the U.N. agency's Rome headquarters, says 2 billion people worldwide already supplement their diets with insects, which are high in protein and minerals, and have environmental benefits. Commenting on the increase in sales, Emma Murphy, Selfridges Confectionery . Buyer said: 'The Edible range has a broad appeal and there are a number . of customers who appreciate the high protein levels in the range as it . offers an alternative to high protein diets. 'The . Mopain Ants have as much protein per gram as a breast of chicken. Around Christmas time, we find customers buy  the range for novelty . value. 'The Scorpion . vodka, The Gold Lolly and the Mopain worms do really well over Christmas . especially as 'I'm a Celebrity' is on at that time, too.' Insects are 'extremely efficient' in converting feed into edible meat, according to the WHO report. On average, they can convert 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of feed into 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of insect mass. In comparison, cattle require 8 kilograms (17.6 pounds) of feed to produce a kilo of meat. Insects are full of protein, fibre and a range of micronutrients . Currently, most edible insects are gathered in forests and what insect farming does take place is often family-run and serves niche markets. But the U.N. says mechanisation can ratchet up insect farming production. The fish bait industry, for example, has long farmed insects. Insect farming is 'one of the many ways to address food and feed security,' the food agency said. 'Insects are everywhere and they reproduce quickly,' the agency said, adding they leave a 'low environmental footprint.' They provide high-quality protein and nutrients when compared with meat and fish and are 'particularly important as a food supplement for undernourished children,' it said. Insects can also be rich in copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, selenium and zinc, and are a source of fibre. The agency noted that its Edible Insect Program is also examining the potential of arachnids, such as spiders and scorpions, although they are not strictly speaking insects. University biologists have analysed the nutritional value of edible insects, and some of them, such as certain beetles, ants, crickets and grasshoppers, come close to lean red meat or broiled fish in terms of protein per gram. Worm Salt; £7.99 . Infused with chilli and agave worm, the salt has an intense smoky flavour, traditionally used in southern Mexico as a seasoning for salsas. English Gin infused with an edible earthworm; £26.99 . These earthworms are grown in the fertile soils of Southern England. You can eat the worm after drinking the gin, it makes a delightful treat. Chocolate Covered Scorpion; £5.99 . Farm-raised edible scorpion has been hand-dipped in Belgian dark chocolate.

ff6ebfdb2beb78d15c6e37aaec07457590640ca9,"Washington (CNN) -- No employees of NBC will face criminal charges over the display of a high-capacity ammunition magazine on a ""Meet the Press"" program in violation of local law in Washington, prosecutors told the network on Friday. The capital city's attorney general, Irvin Nathan, said in a letter to NBC there would be no charges, but added that it was ""a very close decision."" Nathan also said ""there is no doubt of the gravity of the illegal conduct in this matter, especially in a city and a nation that have been plagued by carnage from gun violence."" The letter also confirmed the 30-round magazine displayed by show host David Gregory on December 23 was empty. At the time, Gregory was interviewing Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle Association, a strong opponent of new gun control proposals. Nathan said the network used the magazine with the ""purpose of informing an ongoing public debate about firearms policy"" not long after the school shooting massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. Even an empty magazine violates city law. Conviction carries a possible sentence of up to a year in jail as well as a possible fine of up to $1,000. A police spokeswoman said that NBC asked before the program whether it would be legal to show a high capacity magazine on air and was told no. An official with the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives told CNN he consulted with city police after receiving a similar request from NBC and was told an empty magazine would not be a problem. The official passed the information to NBC, but later learned there was a ""miscommunication"" with police and that showing an empty magazine would, indeed, violate the law. The official said he did not give NBC permission to use a magazine. In his letter, Nathan referred to ""feeble and unsatisfactory efforts"" made by NBC to find out what it could legally do. ""Although there appears to have been some misinformation provided initially, NBC was clearly and timely advised by a (Metropolitan Police Department) employee that its plans to exhibit on the broadcast a high capacity magazine would violate D.C. law, and there was no contrary advice from any federal official,"" Nathan said. He added that any uncertainty about the law was unjustified. ""Meet the Press"" issued an e-mailed statement following Nathan's decision. ""We displayed the empty magazine solely for journalistic purposes to help illustrate an important issue for our viewers,"" the show said. ""We accept the District of Columbia Attorney General's admonishment, respect his decision and will have no further comment on this matter.""","'Meet the Press' host displayed empty high-capacity ammo clip on air .

Nick Pollard has admitted not including the claim that then-director general Mark Thompson knew about the Newsnight investigation into Savile . BBC chairman Chris Patten is facing claims he helped cover up key evidence about the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal. For . three months, Lord Patten has been aware of a secret tape in which the . author of the official £3million inquiry into the debacle said he made a . ‘mistake’ in his final report. In . a recording leaked online yesterday, Nick Pollard admitted ignoring . bombshell claims suggesting the BBC’s former director-general was . specifically warned about the disgraced DJ’s sex abuse yet allowed . glowing tributes to be screened after Savile’s death. Despite . being handed a transcript of the conversation in September, Lord Patten . has repeatedly refused to reopen the investigation and even warned one . MP he could be sued if he attempted to publish it. At . the heart of the row is a conflict between one of the BBC’s most . powerful female executives, director of radio Helen Boaden, and former . director-general Mark Thompson, now chief executive of the New York . Times. Mr Thompson was in . charge of the BBC when a devastating TV report into Savile’s predatory . past was shelved, sparking a wave of recriminations that culminated in . the resignation of his successor. His . repeated assurances that he was never told about the sex-abuse . allegations were accepted by the Pollard inquiry. In the official report . published a year ago, Mr Pollard said he had ‘no reason to doubt Mr . Thompson’s account’. But in . the tape recording, Mr Pollard privately admitted to a journalist that . his report had been flawed. He had been handed a letter by lawyers . acting for Miss Boaden which directly contradicted Mr Thompson’s . evidence. She said she . warned Mr Thompson about the contents of the Newsnight investigation in a . phone call in December 2011, weeks before a Christmas tribute to Savile . aired. Mr Pollard was asked to examine the events which lead up to Newsnight abandoning its investigation into allegations of abuse against Savile, which were later revealed in an ITV documentary . Former BBC director of news Helen Boaden informed the Pollard review that she had told then-director-general Mark Thompson about a proposed Newsnight report into Savile - something Mr Thomson denies . The BBC Trust denied that chairman Lord Patten had threatened Tory MP Rob Wilson with legal action if he released the tape . In the recording, Mr . Pollard – who was paid £96,000 for eight weeks’ work – admits it was a . ‘mistake’ to leave the claims out of his report. Pressure is now growing . on Lord Patten to explain why he has not reopened the inquiry. He . was accused of trying to suppress the truth by warning  Tory MP Rob . Wilson, who tried to publish the recording this week, that he should be . ‘weighing up the legal liabilities that might arise’. Tory . MP Philip Davies, who sits on the Commons culture media and sport . committee, said the chairman’s position is ‘untenable’, adding: ‘Lord . Patten has become a joke. Any credibility he had left has completely . evaporated.’ Last night, the . BBC Trust said it was taking the recording ‘seriously’ and had passed . it on to Mr Pollard so he can give his version. A . spokesman added: ‘There was no legal threat – the letter merely . suggested Mr Wilson might want to satisfy himself the recording was not . defamatory, should he decide to release it.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Nick Pollard headed inquiry into why Newsnight dropped Savile report .

ff6ed9295e3dc74846a9052928b68dab2814ffc7,"As Luis Suarez’s first goal went in on Tuesday night, Manuel Pellegrini sank back in his seat. It was hard to tell whether the look was one of exasperation or resignation. Pellegrini had a year to prepare for this, a year to solve the problems that characterised his team’s defeat against Barcelona last season. It took just a quarter of an hour for him to realise he hadn’t managed it. For all that Manchester City found a way back into this game in the second half, the decisive period was the opening half-hour. It told us that City continue to chase their tails when it comes to finding the right template in the Champions League. Brazilian midfielder brings down Luis Suarez having struggled to control the middle of the park on Tuesday . Manchester City's players are stunned after Barcelona put in a magnificent first-half performance . James Milner (right) had a tough task in the centre of midfield as Barcelona prevailed 2-1 at the Etihad . They grabbed something from this game by chasing it hard. Their energy and will found them a way and Joe Hart’s penalty save at the death means that the Barclays Premier League champions head to Spain next month in better spirits than they might have mustered. The truth is, however, that teams do not make significant headway in this tournament by chasing games, especially at home. Dominance comes from solid possession. It comes from control and method. City continue to invest in their squad but nights like this raise valid questions about whether the team is actually moving forward. If this seems unkind given the stellar nature of the opposition, so be it. This is the company City have made it their stated intention to keep. Nobody expects them to dominate the ball against Luis Enrique’s extraordinarily gifted team. The one way to make sure you fail against Barcelona is by trying to copy them. Former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez whips in his first-goal for the visitors after just 16 minutes . Suarez runs away with his trademark celebration having given the La Liga giants the lead in the first-half . Nevertheless, City must realise they simply must do better. They must find a way to dictate passages of play against the best opposition, if not the whole game. There remains a lack of authority to their play in Europe. It is not just Barcelona who have come to the Etihad Stadium and messed the home team around for periods. Bayern Munich have done it. AS Roma have done it. Even Napoli and CSKA Moscow have done it. One senses that Pellegrini and football director Txiki Begiristain know exactly what the problem is. It goes right to the heart of the team — to the centre of the City midfield. This is where foundations for victories at this level are built. This is where momentum builds. It comes from possession, from the rhythm of simply moving the ball. Manchester City keeper Joe Hart (centre) reacts after Barcelona went 2-0 after just 30 minutes . Fernando (centre) grapples with Barcelona's Lionel Messi as he attempts to regain possession . City have invested in the Brazilian duo Fernandinho and Fernando over the last two summers in a bid to construct a platform. Frank Lampard has added something domestically in that area this season. On Tuesday, James Milner began the game there with Fernando. Still, though, City look a million miles short. Certainly they do when compared to players like Barcelona’s Sergio Busquets and, for example, Bayern’s Bastian Schweinsteiger, or even Chelsea’s Nemanja Matic. On Tuesday night, City missed Yaya Toure, of course. The Ivorian was suspended. Even Toure, though, has looked muddled at times in Europe — not knowing whether to go or hold —and that is perhaps why City’s search has led them to the door of the French international midfielder Paul Pogba of Juventus. James Milner (right) struggled to help Manchester City dictate the midfield against Barcelona . The former Manchester United player will not come cheap this summer but City’s interest is real. He is the right age and it is not hard to see where Pogba’s physicality would improve this team. On Tuesday, Fernando and Milner were humbled from the start. The Brazilian had a wretched night. His first contribution was to give the ball straight to Busquets. The subsequent pass almost landed on Lionel Messi’s toe. Some start that would have been. Suarez can't hide his delight having scored his second of the night to put Barcelona 2-0 up on the night . Ten minutes later the City midfielder erred again, passing the ball to Suarez who raced through on goal. During a 30-minute spell during the middle of the opening half, City were second best by a rather distressing distance. Messi was almost impossible to track, sometimes dropping so deep he could almost shake hands with his own central defenders. When he moved, he did so in a manner alien to those in blue. Suarez was similarly difficult to follow and Neymar, operating from a starting position on the left side, timed his forays infield with devastating instinct. A second goal goes in for Barcelona and Joe Hart lets out a roar of frustration in the City goal mouth . Sergio Aguero fired in a delightful strike for City but with two away goals, Barcelona are in command . It was in turn thrilling and demoralising to watch and City really should have been able to come up with a more convincing answer. Everything Barcelona did was straight from the Nou Camp’s most classic playbook. City have invested money and thought in preparing Pellegrini’s squad for nights like this and at times here it was difficult to work out where it had all gone. Certainly City improved in the second half but it was all rather too late. At the end there was a sense of relief that the damage had not been greater. That, however, isn’t what European football is about. It is not about relief or small mercies. It’s about winning, it’s about moving forward. City, undeniably, remain inert.

Convicted: Sex offender James Burns worked as an airport security officer frisking passengers, despite facing fresh allegations of abusing a teenage boy . A convicted sex offender worked as an airport security officer frisking passengers, despite facing fresh allegations of abusing a teenage boy. James Burns, 56, was employed as an aviation security officer at Manchester Airport after passing a criminal record and counter terrorism check. However, the checks failed to highlight . his previous convictions for historic sexual assaults because the Police . National Computer at that time did not include all offences from the 70s . and 80s. Burns was given tasks including patting down passengers during security checks carried out before travellers are allowed to board an aircraft. But at the time he was offered the job in 2013 Burns was being investigated by police over new allegations of abusing a 16-year-old boy, who can not be named for legal reasons. He failed to tell his bosses about the allegations and it was not until he was convicted after a trial at Manchester Crown Court earlier this year that Burns came clean with bosses as his past came to light. Burns, Westhoughton, Bolton, was suspended on full pay after he was found guilty of four counts of sexual assault on a 16-year-old boy. However, he has still not been sacked despite the fact that this week he was given a nine month sentence suspended for two years and a 12-month supervision order. He was also placed on the sexual offenders register for ten years and subject to a sexual offences prevention order, which means he cannot be allowed unsupervised access to any children under 16, and must not seek to befriend any male under that age. The court was told that between August and December in 2007, Burns assaulted the victim, telling him that he was gay, despite the fact he was married with a wife and children. Burns also bombarded the teenager with sexually explicit and suggestive text messages, telling him that no one would believe him if he told anyone about the abuse. The victim received up to 40 lewd text messages a night, and said he was showered with gifts and cash by Burns. At the time of the offences Burns ran his own courier business, but his firm folded in 2010 and he later applied for and got the job at the airport. Workplace: Burns worked as an aviation security officer at Manchester Airport, and his role included physical contact with passengers, checking them as they went through the security gates . The victim came forward in 2012 after seeking medical help from his GP. During his trial it was revealed that Burns had previous convictions for indecent assault on a teenage boy in 1980 when he impersonated a police officer, and two convictions for public order offences in 1983 and 1984 for propositioning young men for sex in Bolton. Burns worked as an aviation security officer at the airport, and his role included physical contact with passengers, checking them as they went through the security gates. A Manchester Airport spokesman said: 'All security officers are given a criminal records check and a counter terrorism check, before they can be based at a UK airport, and the checks highlighted no disqualifying offences. Security: A spokesman for Manchester Airport said that all staff underwent criminal checks before starting work . Still employed: An airport spokesman said that Burns remained suspended on full pay from his job following his conviction . 'Had the check shown up the offences from the 1980s Burns would have been disqualified from working at the airport.' The spokesman added that Burns remained suspended on full pay from his job. The Police National Computer database is continually being updated with historic offences. It is understood that the offences carried out by Burns had not been added to the database at the time he was arrested in 2012.","James Burns worked as an aviation security officer at Manchester Airport .

Britain is set to enjoy a mini spring heatwave this week, but make the most of it as the mercury is set to drop by the weekend. Met Office forecasters predict temperatures could climb to 13C by the middle of the week, higher than the average for this time of year. But they warned the UK won't be basking in bright sunshine for long as the higher temperatures will bring more rain later in the week. Fire and ice: A gamekeeper checks the flames as heather is kept young and tidy by controlled burning carried out between September and April every year, on the Invercauld Estate near Braemar, Aberdeenshire . On fire: The annual burning, or 'swiping' is usually carried out when the heather starts to dry but the peat is still wet - but the keeper had to contend with unusual weather conditions - there was still snow on the highlands . While much of the UK has begun to enjoy . the spring-like weather, one moor keeper braved bleak temperatures, snow . and ice to tend to his heather. Dramatic pictures show the keeper, on the Invercauld Estate, near Braemar, Aberdeenshire, burning the heather to keep it young and healthy. The annual practice, known as swiping, is normally carried out when the weather starts to improve and the heather is dry while the peat is wet. But with freezing temperatures of late, and snow and ice still on the ground in the highlands, the keeper was forced to mix fire and ice, burning his heather in difficult weather conditions. Healthy: Heather burning is a traditional management tool which if carried out can regenerate healthier and benefit livestock and wildlife . The burning plays an important role in . the rural economy, bringing birds together to feed on newly cropped . areas and sustaining the grouse shooting season. Elsewhere, though, temperatures crept up to just below . 13C in places yesterday with temperatures set to stick around at the . level for much of the week. But . despite warmer temperatures during the day, parts of the UK endured a . freezing start yesterday morning, with temperatures dropping below zero and . many places waking to a ground frost. The gallops at Newbury Racecourse in Berkshire were cancelled yesterday as the ground was frozen this morning. Spring is on its way: New born lambs enjoying the shelter and warmth of a barn in Durham, with the lambing season well underway . New born: Lambs enjoying the shelter and warmth of a barn in Durham today . Despite a cold start, spring looked set to be on its way, with newborn lambs pictured in Durham yesterday. A Met office forecaster said this week's warmer temperatures are not unusual for this time of year. She said: 'It is certainly not unusual for this time of year, it will just be a welcome change after the last couple of weeks which have been below average.' Cold start: A ground frost at Newbury Racecourse, in Berkshire, saw the gallops cancelled today . Today was expected to be slightly cooler than yesterday in the north of the UK, but temperatures will still reach 9C or 10C around London. Tuesday will see temperatures rise again to 12C or 13C, with the rest of the week carrying on in a similar vein. The Met Office spokesman added: 'It's possibly becoming a little bit cooler for the weekend. The other thing that you will notice is there is going to be a bit more rain appearing. 'Today, Monday and Tuesday, it is looking mostly dry across the majority of the country with varying amounts of cloud and sunshine depending where you are. 'From Wednesday, rain will start appearing, firstly from south-west Britain then moving across the rest of the country. 'By the end of Wednesday a lot of places will have some but it's not going to be particularly heavy, more cloudy and breezy with a bit of rain. 'Wednesday and Thursday look similar and beyond that it's looking like continued unsettled weather.

ff6fea752242cb7195348ed227b742b687c9eb17,"New York (CNN)  -- Rapper Lil Wayne will go directly to jail after he is sentenced by a Manhattan judge Tuesday afternoon for a gun conviction, according to a person familiar with the case. Dwayne Carter, as he is known legally, pleaded guilty to felony gun charges in a deal with prosecutors October 2009. He is expected to get a one-year prison sentence. His sentencing was delayed three weeks so he could get some dental work done, including removal of his diamond-studded braces. The person familiar with the case would not confirm where Wayne would serve his sentence. The plea agreement was a result of the rapper's 2007 arrest outside New York's Beacon Theater. According to police, Wayne had a .40-caliber pistol on his tour bus. ""It's not his gun, they know whose gun it is,"" Wayne's attorney, Stacey Richman, said after a hearing last month. In an unrelated case, Wayne also faces felony drug possession and weapons charges in the state of Arizona. Lil Wayne is a multiplatinum-selling and Grammy-winning rap artist. His hits include ""The Block is Hot"" and ""Lollipop,"" and his album ""Tha Carter III"" was the top-selling disc of 2008. His latest album, ""Rebirth,"" was released last month.

For years it has hardly merited a second glance and is at risk of demolition - but Preston bus station has been named a 'historic' work of architectural beauty and added to a list of worldwide places that need protection. The bus station in Lancashire, along with a Greek cemetery, the ancient Nazca Lines in Peru and a modernist building in New York are this year's most at-risk cultural heritage sites, according to the World Monuments Fund. Some 67 structures in 41 countries have been placed on a 'Watch' list by the non-profit organisation which supports the preservation of 'treasured places'. 'Historic': Preston bus station in Lancashire has been added to a list of protected world monuments because of its 'concrete brutalist' style . The sites on the 2012 list balance heritage concerns with the social, economic, and environmental interests of communities around the world, said World Monuments Fund President Bonnie Burnham. Miss Burnham said: 'While these sites are historic, they are also very much of the present - integral parts of the lives of the people who come into contact with them every day. 'Indeed, the Watch reminds us of our collective role as stewards of the earth and of its human heritage.' The WMF is an independent organisation which aims to secure the future of 'exceptional' places through fundraising, conservation and education. Among the newly-listed sites is the First Cemetery of Athens, the oldest in the Greek capital, which houses the graves of important figures from the past two centuries. The fund said it is in need of preservation as it has fallen into neglect. The ancient Nazca lines and geoglyphs in the desert of southern Peru are also in jeopardy due to poorly managed tourism, says the fund. The giant figures, which were drawn on the stone between 500 BC and 500 AD, were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994. Brutalist style: The distinctive bus station in Lancashire has been slated for demolition despite being recognised as an architectural gem . Desert design: The ancient geoglyphs in the Nazca desert in southern Peru have been protected by UNESCO since 1994 . Built at the end of the 1960s, Preston bus station can hold 80 double-deckers and was once the largest terminal in the world. It was designed by Keith Ingham and Charles Wilson of Building Design Partnership along with E.H Stazicker and is described as having a 'brutalist' style. The building's engineers, Ove Arup and Partners, designed the distinctive curve of the car park balconies after vertical walls proved too expensive. The edges have a functional aspect too - they protect car bumpers from crashing. The structure has been threatened with demolition for around a decade as part of the council's redevelopment scheme. A survey conducted by the Lancashire Evening Post last year found that Preston bus station was the local people's favourite building. Preston Bus Station was once the world's largest but has been slated for demolition as part of a redevelopment scheme by the council. It is listed by the fund along with other British sites described as 'concrete brutalism' including Birmingham Central Library and the Hayward Gallery at the South Bank Centre in London. The library in Birmingham is to be knocked down in 2013 while the gallery in the South Bank complex has been refused listed building status. Miss Burnham added: 'These and other buildings like them date from an era in which government had the resources and the will to create major civic buildings. 'They are too often seen as impediments to private-sector redevelopment.' The World Monuments Fund also questioned the planning permission for recent . alterations to the former Manufacturers Trust Company Building at 510 . Fifth Avenue, a small box-shaped glass building which sits among the Manhattan skyscrapers. A spokesman for the fund said: 'Local advocates filed a lawsuit, and a temporary restraining order on further alterations has been issued. 'While the case seeks to preserve an icon of American modernism, it also serves as an important touchstone for the effectiveness of preservation legislation and policies in the United States, and of the government agencies charged with their enforcement.' Several sites that have been damaged by earthquakes also made the list including locations in Japan, New Zealand and Haiti. Since the fund started in 1996, some 688 sites across 132 countries have been protected. There are seven British sites listed by the WMF this year. The others are: the medieval ruins of Coventry Cathedral; Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, known as the home of Lord Byron; Quarr Abbey, a working monastery on the Isle of Wight, and St Helena, the island in the South Atlantic where Napoleon was held captive. A . spokesman added: 'The international attention given to . watch sites provides a vital tool with which local entities may leverage . funding from a variety of sources.'

'Manipulation': Tom Winsor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, spoke at the Home Affairs Select Committee to dispute Met chief evidence . The police watchdog has told MPs that it is 'almost certain that some manipulation is going on' in the recording of crime statistics by officers. Tom Winsor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, told the Home Affairs Select Committee 'in anything that gets measured' there is an 'incentive, resisted by many, to manipulate the process to make your own performance look good'. And Mr Winsor, the first chief inspector of constabulary to come from a non-policing background, disputed evidence given by the chief of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who claimed inspectors lauded his force's crime data as 'competent and reliable'. His comments come after whistle-blowing police constable James Patrick told the Public Administration Select Committee officers routinely massage crime statistics to boost their forces' performance figures. Asked by Committee chair Keith Vaz MP if there is manipulation occurring, Mr Winsor, a former rail regulator and lawyer, said: 'It is almost certain that some manipulation going on. The question is where, how much, how severe.' He earlier added: 'The fact is in anything that gets measured, once those who are being measured, whose performance are being measured, work out how the system works, there's an incentive, resisted by many, to manipulate the process as to make your own performance look good.' Mr Vaz said Sir Bernard and Sir Hugh Orde, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), had not told the Committee earlier this month that they believe fiddling of statistics is currently occurring. Mr Winsor said: 'Sir Bernard gave evidence, I think to this committee on December 3, where he said that in 2012 HMIC inspected the Met and found their figures in terms of crime recording were ""competent and reliable"". 'I've written to Sir Bernard about this because what HMIC in fact said was that it looked at ""244 incidents logged by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), 30 had been wrongly closed without a crime being raised, while in overall terms the MPS continues to improve its crime and incident data quality, this indicates that crime and ASB (anti-social behaviour) data recorded in London gives some cause for concern"". Dispute: Chief of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, claimed inspectors lauded his force's crime data as . 'competent and reliable' but Mr Winsor has written to him to dispute this . 'So there is a big difference between ""some cause of concern"" and ""competent and reliable"". I have not yet received Sir Bernard's response.' Mr Vaz asked the chief inspector if he was still 'very concerned'. Mr Winsor added: 'I'd just like him to explain the disparity I'd referred to. But with crime recording, some people will call it fiddling, some people will call it honest mistakes, some people will call it the perfectly legitimate exercise of professional judgment.' Asked what he would call it, the chief inspector said: 'It depends on the circumstances of individual cases.' Mr Patrick - who is currently awaiting disciplinary proceedings - also told the Public Administration Select Committee that serious offences including rape and child sex abuse are being recorded as 'crime-related incidents' or 'no crimes'. And a former chief inspector in West Midlands Police told the same hearing about techniques used by officers to improve performance figures known as 'cuffing', 'nodding', 'skewing' and 'stitching'.","Tom Winsor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, spoke to MPs .

The French appeals court has ruled that an investigation into allegations that former president Nicolas Sarkozy duped L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt into donating election campaign funds can proceed. The decision, which could lead to a trial in the long-running scandal, complicates any political comeback by Sarkozy, who has been dogged for years by the 'Bettencourt affair' in which he denies any misconduct. Sarkozy is the French conservative voters' favourite to take on Socialist President Francois Hollande in 2017 after losing to him last year. Worried: Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, centre, is pictured leaving Bordeaux' courthouse . But he could suffer if he is tried over allegations of exploiting the mental frailty of France's richest woman. 'There is more chance of a trial on the horizon for Sarkozy, and as for his eventual return to politics, it's obviously a lot more complicated for him' political analyst Christophe Barbier told iTele. 'He is no longer master of his own calendar.' A lawyer for one of the 12 people investigated in the case said the decision would be appealed to the Cour de Cassation, the country's highest appeals court. Sarkozy's lawyers, who did not comment on Tuesday's decision, have five days to join that appeal.A final judgment by that court could take many months, but Sarkozy could be called to face trial at any time. Sarkozy was placed under formal . investigation in March for ""abuse of weakness"" of Bettencourt after she . was declared in a state of dementia. He was allegedly seeking funds for . his 2007 election campaign. Under . French law, a formal investigation means there is 'serious or . consistent evidence' pointing to likely implication of a suspect in a . crime. It often but not always leads to trial. The public prosecutor handling the case recommended in June that it be dropped for lack of evidence. Accused: Nicolas Sarkozy, left, was been told that charges of allegedly ‘abusing the weakness’ of the richest woman in the world, Liliane Bettencourt , right, can be investigated . In France, investigating magistrates can proceed with a formal inquiry over the objections of a prosecutor. The . appeal court's decision on Tuesday to proceed with the investigation . was announced to reporters outside the court in the southwest city of . Bordeaux by Nicolas Huc-Morel, the Bettencourt family lawyer. It . was prompted by a challenge mounted in July by lawyers for Sarkozy and . 11 others placed under investigation. They contested a 2011 medical . report that determined Bettencourt had been suffering from dementia . since 2006. Lawyers argued . the formal inquiry could not be viewed as impartial because one of the . doctors involved in the report was a friend of the judge who placed . Sarkozy under investigation, Jean-Michel Gentil. Defeat: Sarkozy and his third wife Carla Bruni leave the Elysee Palace . as current French president Francois Hollande and his partner Valerie . Trierweiler look on . 'Were . the (medical) expertise to have fallen through, it would have weakened . the case and the formal investigation could have caved in' Barbier said. 'In short, the main pillar in the Bettencourt case would have . collapsed.' Sarkozy has . largely stayed out of the limelight since his defeat to Hollande last . year, but has dropped hints this year that he is mulling a re-election . bid. Any comeback would . hinge on the outcome of the Bettencourt case and a series of other legal . cases involving people close to him, including alleged political . rigging in an arbitration payout to a high-profile businessman. When the charges were first brough, Sarkozy was said to be in a 'state of incomprehension'. The former French president has been charged with taking financial advantage of frail l'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, 90. With his political career in ruins, Mr Sarkozy now faces a criminal trial and the possibility of going to prison. Nicolas Sarkozy's wife the model and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy performs at the Echo Music Awards in Berlin, Germany . Deapite his legal team was preparing to . appeal against the decision, political allies made it clear that he was . shell shocked as he returned from Bordeaux - where he was charged - to . the Paris home he shares with his third wife, former supermodel Carla . Bruni. 'As you can imagine he is in a state . of incomprehension,' said Jean-Francois Cope, president of Mr Sarkozy's . conservative UMP party. Francois Fillon, Mr Sarkozy's former . prime minister, went on to Twitter to say the decision was 'unfair' and . said 'the truth will triumph'. Mr Sarkozy's lawyer Thierry Herzog . also attacked the indictment as 'legally incoherent and unfair' saying . his client was being treated 'scandalously.' Mr Sarkzoy was unexpectedly summoned on Thursday to the Bordeaux offices of Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in charge of the case. There he met at least four former . members of Bettencourt's staff, who said Mr Sarkozy regularly turned up . at the Bettencourt mansion in Paris to accept cash to help fund his 2007 . election campaign. Mrs Bettencourt's doctors say her . mental capacity began to deteriorate from the autumn of 2006, meaning . she would have been particularly vulnerable to people asking her for . money. The principal allegation is that Mr . Sarkozy obtained up to 4 million euros from her, breaching electoral . spending limits and taking advantage of a person weakened by ill health. Jean-Michel Gentil, the judge in . charge, hoped to establish today how many times Mr Sarkozy actually . visited Mrs Bettencourt’s luxury Paris home in the months before he was . elected. Mr Sarkozy insists that it was only once, despite many former Bettencourt staff members saying he was always popping round. Troubadour: Carla Bruni seen arrives back at home in Paris today. She has recently completed a new album called Little French Songs . The . principal allegation against Mr Sarkozy is that he took advantage of . the frail state of the aged widow to take money from her. Claire Thibout, Mrs Bettencourt’s . former accountant, told police in 2010 that she had handed cash-filled . envelopes to Bettencourt's financial manager, Patrice de Maistre, who . subsequently passed them on to Mr Sarkozy's campaign treasurer, Eric . Woerth. Mr Sarkozy is also said to have collected money in person. While Mr Sarkozy was being charged with the offences in Bordeaux, his wife Carla Bruni was in Berlin where she was performing at the Echo music awards. She is about to make a return to modelling starring in a campaign for Italian fashion house Bulgari. Top fashion photographer Terry Richardson reportedly photographed Bruni in Rome for the campaign this week. Ms Bruni has also recently completed a new album called Little French Songs in which she allegedly mocks current French Prime Minister Francois Hollande by referring to him as a penguin. Mr Sarkozy lost his immunity from . prosecution when he lost the 2012 presidential election to his Socialist . rival Francois Hollande. Within a few weeks, the home he shares with Ms Bruni was raided by anti-corruption police. In 2011, Mr Sarkozy's predecessor, . Jacque Chirac, was found guilty on corruption charges related to his . time as mayor of Paris, and received a two-year suspended prison . sentence. Since losing to Mr Hollande, Mr . Sarkozy had been trying to make money on the international conference . circuit, but he also hinted that he might return to power in 2017. But he faces numerous other . corruption enquiries, including claims that he took cash from Colonel . Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator. Despite all this, Sarkozy has . regularly hinted that he may still make a bid to return to the Elysee . Palace in 2017. This now looks an impossibility. Mrs Bettencourt was recently listed as the richest woman in the world by Forbes magazine.","Former French president now faces possible prison sentence .

White smoke billowed from a building in the compound while heavily armed British and Afghan forces cordoned off the area in the center of the capital, establishing a security perimeter around the buildings. The attacks occurred inside a well-guarded Kabul neighborhood, leaving at least 16 people wounded, the Afghan Interior Ministry said. Among the dead was one New Zealand Special Forces service member, officials said. ""I have limited details about the soldier's death, but I am advised that he died during fighting that followed an attack by insurgents in Kabul in the last few hours,"" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said. ""On behalf of the government, I want to offer my condolences to the family of the soldier."" The strike, which the Taliban have claimed responsibility for, coincides with the 92nd anniversary of Afghan independence from Great Britain. Eyewitnesses: 'Whole house shaking' In the first attack, a militant drove a vehicle packed with explosives toward the Council's main security gate before detonating the device, according to Afghan police spokesman Hashamap Stanikzai. A second man then attempted to enter the compound wearing a vest filled with explosives. He also detonated himself, Stanikzai said. Police say two militants were killed in a firefight with security forces. The other three detonated their explosives. Gunfire could be heard throughout the incident, and military helicopters circled overhead. The British Council is a British government-affiliated body that fosters cultural and academic exchanges in Afghanistan. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack, as did the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. ""Initial reports indicate a combination of multiple vehicle-borne and personal-borne (improvised explosive devices) were detonated,"" the ISAF statement said. NATO commander Gen. John Allen pledged to hold ""the perpetrators accountable for their actions."" Meanwhile, an embassy spokesman said British government personnel are coordinating with Afghan authorities to secure the area. The strike occurred not far from the Intercontinental Hotel, the scene of another insurgent attack against a high-profile Western target in June.

A Missouri couple has filed for bankruptcy just eight years after winning a $20 million lawsuit against the makers of a butter popcorn flavoring that gave one of them lung disease. Eric Peoples of Carthage and his wife, Cassandra, sued International Flavors and Fragrances Inc. and Bush Boake Allen Inc. in 2004 after Mr Peoples developed bronchiolitis obliterans while working at a popcorn plant in Jasper. But just eight years later, the two are being forced to sell the home they built for $3.9 million to pay off creditors, after their financial situation went spectacularly downhill. Popcorn couple: Eric Peoples, pictured right with wife Cassandra, have filed for bankruptcy after winning a $20 million verdict against the makers of a butter popcorn flavouring in 2004 . According to the Joplin Globe, the Peoples listed the current value of their residence and 10.5 acres of land at just $700,000 and personal property assets of nearly $33,000. But their liabilities are listed at more than $611,000, including a $482,876 mortgage with U.S. Bank. The couple's case against the butter flavouring companies was the first of several brought by workers and their spouses. The suit claimed Mr Peoples, who has two children with his wife, developed . the lung disease after being exposed to diacetyl, a . chemical present in the flavouring to give a buttery taste and aroma. Researchers . have found that, when heated, the chemical produces a toxic, . potentially lethal gas, and can leave those exposed with a shortness of . breath, a dry cough and wheezing. At the trial, doctors testified that Eric Peoples would eventually need a double-lung transplant. Losing their home: The couple are being forced to sell the Carthage home, pictured, they spent $3.9 million on . Drop: The Peoples listed the current value of their residence, pictured, and 10.5 acres of land at just $700,000 . Opulent: Pictures show the grand entryway to the home, which took five years to build . A Jasper County jury awarded Eric Peoples $18 million and his wife $2 million. It has never been revealed exactly how much of that verdict money the couple received. Mr Peoples said at the time that his . attorney's firm would take 35 per cent of the pay out, and their . attorney, Ken McClain, suggested a portion would be spread among other . workers involved in the lawsuits. Though it is not clear how they spent . the remaining millions, purchases include two Honda automobiles, a . Chrysler PT Cruiser and a Kawasaki Mule. Other personal property listed in . court documents include a bedroom set, dryer, end tables, china, lamps, a . VCR, a microwave oven and $50 worth of camera equipment, ABC reported. Since winning the lawsuit, Cassandra . Peoples has also been employed by Smith Midwest . Realty as a realtor. Social networking sites also indicate she helps run PJ's Country Bakery in Joplin, Missouri. Struggle: Eric Peoples, pictured left in 2007 in front of the Jasper popcorn plant and right with his wife at the wedding of their daughter, has suffered ill health since working for the company . But among the unsecured claims the couple list in their bankruptcy petition is a November 1, 2011, judgment in Jasper County Circuit Court to Jeff Neely, the contractor who built their home over a five-year period. He sued them in August 2011, claiming they still owed him $107,147. The couple failed to respond to the lawsuit in a timely manner, and a judge granted Mr Neely a default judgment at an annual interest rate of 9 per cent. The couple filed a motion last December asking the judge to set aside the default judgment because of difficulties, including a downturn in Mr Peoples' health. Their motion also asserted a basis for a counterclaim against Mr Neely because they said the house initially was estimated to cost $400,000, but skyrocketed to more than $3.9 million. Neither the Peoples' motion nor the bankruptcy petition explains the $3.2 million difference between what they claimed to have paid to build the home and what they say the property is worth now. Popcorn lung, also known as bronchiolitis obliterans, may be caused by inhalation of airborne diacetyl, a chemical used to produce the butter-like flavoring in microwaveable popcorn. When the chemical is heated, it produces a toxic, potentially fatal gas, researchers believe. The non-reversible disease affects the bronchioles - small airway branches in the lungs - which become narrowed by scar tissue and inflammation. It causes dry cough, shortness of breath and wheezing, and can lead to the need for lung transplants. It first came to public attention when eight former employees of the Gilster-Mary Lee popcorn plant in Jasper, Missouri, developed bronchiolitis obliterans in the late 1990s. In 2000, the Missouri Department of Health called in The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to make a determination of the cause, and to recommend safety measures. After surveying the plant and each patient's medical history, NIOSH recommended respiratory protection for all workers in microwave popcorn production . In September, a court awarded Wayne Watson, 59, from Denver, Colorado $7.2 million after he developed the condition from eating three packs of the snack each day. Jurors agreed that the popcorn manufacturer and the supermarket chain that sold it were negligent by failing to warn on labels that the butter flavoring, diacetyl, was dangerous.","Popcorn factory worker Eric Peoples and wife Cassandra won the multimillion dollar payout in 2004 .

ff73272f039a91411bae91bb704c560ff22154b7,"(CNN) -- American teenager Sloane Stephens stunned her compatriot Serena Williams on Wednesday, beating the 15-time grand slam winner 3-6 7-5 6-4 to reach the Australian Open semifinals. The 29th seed, playing in her first grand slam quarterfinal, came from once set down to overcome third seed Williams who suffered a back injury having already rolled an ankle earlier in the tournament. Despite Williams' fitness problems, few had given Stephens a chance of beating the five-time Melbourne champion. ""Someone asked me, 'Do you think you can win?' I was like, 'Yeah, I think so, but I wasn't like too clear about it,''"" the 19-year-old told reporters after advancing to a tie with world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka on Thursday. ""Then this morning when I got up, I was like, 'Look, dude, like, you can do this, go out and play and do your best.'"" Stephens did not make the best possible start as Williams went one set and a break of serve ahead, before the 19-year-old American dug deep to pull out an unlikely triumph. ""You just fight and just get every ball back, run every ball down, and just get a lot of balls in play,"" said Stephens, explaining her strategy after the loss of that first set. ""From then on I got aggressive, started coming to the net more, and just got a lot more comfortable."" Stephens becomes the first U.S. teenager to reach a grand slam semfinal since Serena at the 2001 U.S. Open, and the first to achieve the feat outside of the Williams sisters since Alexandra Stevenson at Wimbledon in 1999. For Williams, it marked the end of a campaign which had pushed her body to the limit. ""I'm almost relieved that it's over because there's only so much I felt I could do,"" said the 31-year-old. ""It's been a little difficult. I've been thrown a lot of balls these two weeks."" When one journalist asked Williams if she had considered retiring hurt during the match, it caused some confusion in the press room. ""Are you kidding me? I'm not retiring,"" responded Williams, believing the reporter was asking if she was considering ending her career. ""Oh, you mean, retiring in the match! Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you meant my career. You're crazy. ""I thought about it like for a nanosecond. It's a quarterfinal of a grand slam. Even if I have to take off in a wheeler before I retire."" Defending champion Azarenka had to battle through a tough 77-minute first set against Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, before winning 7-5 6-1. When asked about Stephens prior to her victory against Williams, Belarus' Azarenka said: ""I think Sloane is a very, very talented girl. I think over the last couple years you see her development, you know, as a tennis player. ""Her game has come together. She's an all round player, very competitive. I think she has a good potential. It's just a matter of her getting all those details in place and really wanting to achieve great things.""

Scrap: George Osborne was told by business leaders that the 50p tax band is strangling entrepreneurship . More than 500 business leaders last night called on the Chancellor to axe the 50p top rate of tax in the forthcoming budget. The leaders of some of Britain's most successful small firms warned George Osborne that he should ditch the 'politically motivated' tax on those earning £150,000 because it will 'damage the economy'. They pointed out that the tax plus National Insurance means that the entrepreneurs the government wants to create jobs are being taxed at 58p in the pound once National Insurance is considered. Responding to claims from the Liberal Democrats that the rich must shoulder more of the burdens of austerity, the business leaders said that the top 1 per cent of taxpayers are already paying 28 per cent of income taxes. In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, they said: 'Penalising high earners through an unfair, politically-motivated tax puts populist politics before sound economics. 'The result is that the 50p tax is set to reduce government income, and damage the economy, the public services and charitable giving.' The letter will fuel demands by Tory MPs for the Chancellor to slash the 50p rate, which is seen as a class war measure introduced by Labour that does nothing to raise tax revenues since it simply drives entrepreneurs abroad. Demand: 500 business leaders have called for George Osborne to scrap the 50p tax band . But the Lib Dems have said there can be no moment on the 50p tax rate until the threshold at which people pay the basic rate of income tax to £10,000. The letter continued: 'The tax, which is in effect a 58p tax after national insurance is taken into account, puts wealth creators like us in a very awkward position. 'We believe the richest should help the poorest in society. But 1 per cent of taxpayers are forecast to contribute nearly 28 per cent of income taxes. 'As businesspeople, we want to see our industries, our economy and the third sector thrive. 'Repealing the 50p tax would be a good demonstration of the Chancellor's wish to celebrate British entrepreneurialism, stimulate British industry and contribute to the Government's growth agenda. The sooner this tax is repealed, the better.' It comes as official figures suggest the controversial 50p tax rate, which hits everybody earning more than £150,000, has been a flop. In January, the tax take from people who do self-assessment tax returns collapsed by more than £500million, compared to the same month in 2011. Tax calls: The Chancellor, pictured out jogging yesterday, is unlikely to ditch the 50p tax in this month's budget . The receipts dropped from £10.86 billion in January 2011 to £10.35billion in January 2012, a fall of £509million. It confirms repeated warnings from accountants that many wealthy people would simply do everything possible to avoid paying the tax. For example, many business executives decided to pay themselves a big bonus or dividend before it came into effect in order to avoid losing half of it in tax. Mr Chris Jenkins, Managing Director of BWS Security Systems Ltd, who signed the letter, said: 'Since the 50 per cent tax band was introduced I have stopped taking a salary or dividend that takes me into this higher tax band. I am living off my savings and reduced my over-all spending. Basically, I have chosen not to pay this higher level of tax. 'The loser in this case is HMRC. First, they miss out on income tax revenue. And second, my reduced spending means I am contributing less VAT. My advice to the Government is simple: stop killing the goose that lays the golden egg.' Andrew Denny, Managing Director of Fix-a-Form International, said: 'I am simply trying to create wealth for me, my kids and my loyal staff. Why are high earners treated like they have committed a crime and should be punished?' Charlie Mullins, Managing Director of Pimlico Plumbers, who signed the letter said: 'Ultimately, the 50p tax is self-defeating and will end up hurting the whole of society, not just the rich. 'I don't mind paying my fair-share of taxes. We all want to live in a fairer society. This is what makes Britain great. But the 50p tax is excessive and anti-entrepreneurialism.' Treasury sources say the Chancellor has always made clear the 50p tax rate is 'temporary' but that nothing will happen until an assessment of the tax has been completed.","Entrepreneurs are paying 58p in the pound tax with National Insurance - hitting jobs drive .

Police have named the traveller as Robert Andrew Scott, but say he also uses the Muslim name Jamaluddin Mustafa and is usually seen in Islamic robes. Now understood to be living on the Malaysian island of Penang, 43-year-old Scott has been accused by women who have come forward to the police of duping his wives into caring for him, taking their money, then moving on to another woman. Investigation: Robert Andrew Scott, who also uses the Muslim name Jamaluddin Mustafa, is accused of illegally marrying up to 12 women in Europe and Asia . Special Branch assistant director-general Ayob Pitchay has told Malaysian media that most of the women targeted by Scott were professionals such as bank officers and university lecturers. Mr Pitchay said he understood that Scott was once involved in a missionary movement in London and had joined a mujahiddin - freedom fighters - group in Bosnia. The officer said he had learned of a report that Scott had been held for the murder of a doctor in Bosnia but family members - it is not known which family - had successfully filed an application for his release. 'While he has been involved in militant work in Bosnia, he has not shown such tendencies while in Malaysia,' said Mr Pitchay. 'We are monitoring his marriages and what his real motives are,' said Mr Pitchay, confirming that Scott's alleged wives were of several different nationalities. Two that he had divorced recently were said to be Malaysian. Revealed: Police say Scott was once involved in a missionary movement in London and had joined a mujahiddin - freedom fighters - group in Bosnia . Writers who have come forward anonymously on Facebook allege that the exact number of his wives is unknown because Scott never divorces them officially through the authorities. 'Some victims truly believe there are more than 10,' claimed one writer, who described Scott as a 'heretical and deviant Muslim’. Further claims against Scott say that he is a 'manipulator of emotions' who will try to coax innocent women into having pre-marital sex and then within a matter of weeks will pressure them to marry 'in haste'. Once married, alleges a writer, he will brainwash the wife by twisting Islam and ordering her to obey the husband at all costs.

Minutes before the delivery, her sister Audrey Westich, 29, gave birth to a baby boy, Levi, in Pennsylvania, USA. Andrea was supported by community midwives Rachel Mavers and Amy Kelly, from Liverpool Women’s Hospital, who called it their most amazing home birth yet. Andrea, 33, who gave birth 19 minutes after Audrey, said: 'It was amazing. We joked about it but never dreamed that it would happen. 'We both had home births, we both had boys and we gave birth on the same day, 19 minutes apart, although because of the time difference I was in the afternoon and she was in the morning.' The women said they had been comparing notes and their bumps on Skype all the way through their pregnancies. Andrea added: 'This happened because Audrey was five days late and I was two days early. We are going to call our boys ‘cousin twins’.' Crowding round to see the new arrival with father James were Andrea’s other sons: Elijah, seven, Stephen, six, Daniel, five, Joshua, three and 12-month-old Benjamin. New baby Michael Mansfield at home with father James and in the arms of his mother Andrea, who gave birth just minutes after her sister . Andrea said: 'I always wanted a bunch of boys. This was my second home birth in England - my other four boys were born in the USA - and the midwives, Rachel and Amy were fantastic. It was definitely more relaxing to give birth at home in my own bed. Andrea’s mother Helen was in Florida at the time of the births and was trying to keep tabs on both her daughters as they went through labour. Andrea is originally from Florida and moved to Melling after meeting her husband who works as a pastor at Skelmersdale Baptist Church. Midwives Rachel Mavers on the left and Amy Kelly on the right, assisted Andrea during her home delivery of baby Michael . Rachel Mavers, leader of Liverpool Women’s Maple Team of midwives, based in Kirkby, said: 'Nothing like this has ever happened before at any of my home births. Andrea and her sister were sometimes Facebooking each other during their labour. 'Thousands of babies were being born that day all over the world but it was amazing and a privilege to feel connected to two babies being born at home in two different countries. 'As a midwife, it is humbling to think you are just one of many midwives all over the world caring for women in labour.'","Sisters Audrey, 29, and Andrea, 33,  were given different due dates .

These pictures show how a Catholic monastery which was owned by Henry VIII and Elizabeth I has been converted into a luxury home with a £5.5million price tag. Horton Priory in Ashford, Kent was built in the 12th century - although within its grounds are parts of a settlement dating back as far as the early Iron Age. The complex was originally owned by King Henry I, but he later handed it over to the Cluniac order of monks to be converted into a medieval priory. After the dissolution of the monasteries it was seized by Henry VIII, who passed it on to his daughter Elizabeth before the home was given to the Mantell family in 1970. The Grade I-listed mansion is situated in 55 acres of land, and has undergone a thorough makeover to turn it into a modern home.

ff73eee386390ec2e9e1a29b98505d2df274f6c7,"A two-metre stingray weighing more than 100 kilograms has been set free after being trapped for four days in a rock pool south of Sydney. The large female was released on Wednesday following alleged attempts to gas and even spear the stingray by members of the public to get the animal out of the North Cronulla pool which she became trapped in on Saturday. Manly Sea Life Sanctuary staff organised the 45-minute rescue, with help from Sea Life Sydney Aquarium and Sutherland Shire Council lifeguards. Trapping the stingray in the net only took about 10 minutes at the North Cronulla rock pool . The stingray was at least 100kg with six people struggling to lift the animal onto the rock pool edge . The stingray was too large to swim back over the ledge without assistance from the rescuers . Manly Sea Life sciences manager Rob Townsend told MailOnline that although he had conducted similar rescues of stingrays in a rock pool, none had been as large as this one. ‘It would have to be at least 100 kilos because six of us struggled to lift her,’ he said. The team tried to persuade the creature to swim over the edge of the pool but after numerous attempts it seemed she was too large for the task. 'She was too big to manipulate herself to swim over,' Mr Townsend explained. The only option left was to capture the stingray in a big net and take over to the pool’s edge. It was alleged that members of the public attempted to gas and even spear the large female during the four days before she was freed . Manly Sea Life Sanctuary staff organised the 45-minute rescue, with help from Sea Life Sydney Aquarium and Sutherland Shire Council lifeguards . The stringray needed encouragement by the rescue team to swim off the rock platform . 'We waited for large waves and floated her over the crest of the wave,' he said . Mr Townsend said it took another 5-10 minutes to persuade the stingray to swim off the rock platform. 'We had to stand in her way if she was heading in the wrong direction to encourage her to swim further because they have sophisticated sensory organs,' he said. He heard that there were attempts from members of the public to gas, and even spear the stingray during the four days before she was freed. 'It's not protected species so people are perfectly well within their rights to chop it up for flake although the action is questionable,' he said. 'Setting wild animals free always feels good - its one of the best things we do.'

ff73f93f72443ecadc8b3012a7c351ff359b53fd,"Manchester United midfielder Michael Carrick is set to be out for a month after suffering a muscle injury. The 33-year-old, who has filled in at centre-half for the club, is the latest victim in a season that has been ravaged by injury. United manager Louis van Gaal revealed the news on Friday as his side prepared for a home clash with Leicester City on Saturday. Michael Carrick has been ruled out of action for a month with a muscle rupture . The Dutchman described the injury as a 'muscle rupture' and said that the England international could be out for around four weeks. Van Gaal added that there was better news surrounding winger Ashley Young. The former Aston Villa man has revelled in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 system and has been missed since tearing a hamstring in the New Year's Day draw with Stoke City. But the manager said he is now nearing full fitness, but would not be ready in time for the visit of Nigel Pearson's bottom-of-the-table Foxes. Van Gaal will be hoping United can end a run of two goals in the last three matches. But he says opponents are making it hard for his expensively assembled side. 'We have to play against teams who make the space very narrow, defending with 10 people behind the ball then it is always difficult,' he explained. Carrick's injury is just one of dozens of injuries the Manchester club have had this season . 'We have to play more quickly with high ball speed and disorganise the opponent. We have to improve our ball speed.' Van Gaal refused to blame his misfiring frontline for the problem. 'You have criticised our defence, now we have one of the best defences in the Premier League,' he said. 'Now you are talking about the attack and we are still a force in the attack. I’ve said before it’s not the defence, it’s the team organisation. The strikers have a big part in it but it is not only them.' Van Gaal added that he hoped his side would learn from the previous encounter with Leicester when United let a 3-1 lead turn into a 5-3 humbling. 'We don’t control the match even when we are three against one,' he said. 'That is happening always in football. That is also the beauty of football but as a top club you have to control a match and when you are in a good result like 3 or 2-1 you have to finish the match.'

ff7434023a44b2194705b1808f7f217ca1be7a87,"(CNN) -- Summer has not yet officially arrived, but the country's midsection is burning up. Denver broke a heat record Monday -- and Tuesday promises more sweltering heat. Farther east in Baltimore, a storm threw down a tornado Monday, destroying houses and causing flash flooding. And on the Gulf Coast, rip currents have killed at least four. Heat wave . On Monday, Denver broke its all-time heat record, when the temperature climbed to 99 degrees Fahrenheit, and the sun is expected to bake the Colorado capital again on Tuesday. That's nearly a cool spell for residents in parts of northern Texas, Kansas and Oklahoma, where temperatures are expected to break 100 degrees. Many parts of all four states are suffering from extreme drought, and the National Weather Service has issued numerous fire weather warnings. The service warns that winds will be high, and any fires that start in the parched landscape could spread with extreme speed. Gulf drownings . Treacherous currents took at least four lives on the Alabama Gulf Coast and led Florida officials to shut down a popular beach. Dawn Wood had a friendly chat with two vacationers sitting on the beach next her in Gulf Shores, Alabama. Minutes later, she watched as one of them, a 62-year-old man, drowned, after a rip current pulled him away from the beach, CNN affiliate WPMI reported. His 13-year-old granddaughter, who was swept out with him, tried to drag him from the waves, Wood said. She didn't have the strength. Rescuers in boats rushed to save them, but ""it was just a little too late for him, unfortunately,"" Wood told WPMI. He was one of at least four who died in the currents off the Alabama coast since Sunday. In spite of the drownings and red flag warnings on the beach, people continued to swim, including small children. Two deputies from the sheriff's office in Bay County, Florida, struggled to save a swimmer who became exhausted fighting the current, after being whisked out by the waves. The county was inundated with ""water related calls"" for help Monday, eventually posting double red flag warnings on Panama City Beach, closing it to swimmers to protect them from the currents. Beachgoers entering the water in spite of the warning risk arrest. Eastern tornadoes . Thunderstorms spawned a handful of twisters in Maryland and Kentucky, destroying homes. A funnel cloud in Baltimore was caught on video and made a formidable impression on YouTube. Aside from tearing a hole in a roof of a warehouse in the city's port, it did little damage. A few miles to the west in Sykesville, the violent rumble of wind compelled Dennis Davison to have a look outside, he told CNN affiliate WBAL. He opened his front door to watch pieces of a garage ascend into the sky. ""There is no doubt in my mind that was a tornado,"" he told WBAL. The weather service confirmed two twisters in his area. Baltimore motorists gingerly cruised through streets filled with flood waters left by heavy rains, and more is in the forecast for Tuesday. Flood warnings extend from Washington, DC, up into Philadelphia and New Jersey. Racing away in his pickup truck, Steve Adair tried to outrun what may have been a tornado in southern Kentucky, according to CNN affiliate WTVF. The storm caught up with him. ""You just see a bunch of debris in the air and wind started blowing hard,"" he said, while standing in the ruins of his destroyed countryside home. ""It's just amazing to me how a little bit of wind can do all of this."" Kentucky tornado 'snuck up on us' Nearby, two elderly women hunkered down in a bathtub, while the storm destroyed their home. They survived.","Denver's new heat record pales in comparison with Oklahoma's 100 degree forecast .

Millions of shoppers will splurge around £110 each on average  with spending sprees expected to peak at around 7am this morning, at  Midday and finally around 9pm. Retailers said that Manic Monday - the second Monday in December has overtaken Cyber Monday - the first Monday in December - as the busiest internet shopping day in Britain. Amazon said today they are 'ready to pick, pack and deliver the millions of items that will be ordered' today with pictures  showing how their giant warehouse in Swansea is packed with goods and staff. The site is a quarter of a mile long from end to end and occupies 800,000 square feet -  the size of 11 football pitches - and is packed with thousands of workers. Scroll down for video . Ready for action: These are the stacked shelves of  Amazon's warehouse in Swansea today as shoppers prepare to spend almost £500,000-a-minute online on Christmas presents . Hard work: Staff package up gifts on what experts predict will be the busiest online shopping day of 2014 where £676million will be spent . Vast: Staff walk the site picking up goods from its giant shelves. It is a quarter of a mile long from end to end . UK consumers are expected to spend an astonishing £470,000 a minute on gifts - or £676million in total today on Christmas gifts for their friends and loved-ones. Cyber Monday has traditionally been the most popular day to order presents but the increase in same day delivery and click and collect services mean that people have waited another week before buying because they know they will get it in time for Christmas Day. Analysts believe that in total £4.7billion will be spent on online gifts this Christmas in Britain and the rise of Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Manic Monday could kill off the traditional Boxing Day sales. British retailers are expecting 151million visits to their websites, according to data firm Experian and online retailing trade association IMRG. They expect online traffic to be up by 26 per cent on the same day last year, with shoppers spending an average of £470,000 a minute. In comparison, the two companies predicted consumers would spend £556 million on Black Friday and £650 million on Cyber Monday. But consumers exceeded predictions, splurging on a shopping spree worth an estimated £810 million on Black Friday and £720 million on Cyber Monday. Experts identified Manic Monday last year as the key online shopping date ahead of Christmas as consumers left their shopping later because of increased confidence in delivery networks and click-and-collect services to get gifts to them before the holidays. Huge: In order to cope with all the orders the Swansea warehouse occupies 800,000 square feet and is the size of 11 football pitches . Well stocked: The shelves need to be dozens of feet high and thousands of workers are needed to keep it running over Christmas . Sea change: Cyber Monday has traditionally been the most popular day to order presents but the increase in same day delivery and click and collect services mean that people have waited another week before buying because they know they will get it in time for Christmas Day . Piles of clothing packed neatly in boxes can be seen for as far as the eye can see ready to be shipped out ahead of Manic Monday . In detail: Experts believe sales for Christmas gifts will rocket on several key days, peaking on Manic Monday, December 8 . It is also thought to be fuelled by the widespread use of mobile technology, while the Centre for Retail Research has suggested that the spending can be attributed to shoppers buying early out of fear that the items they want will sell out. Number of online shoppers: Six million . Average spend:  Around £110 each . Age bracket: Majority are between 25 and 34 . Peak times: 7am, Midday and 9pm . Total spend: £676million - £470,000 per min . Retailer website hits: 151million - up 26% . Christmas spending: £4.7billion this year . The heavy discounting offered by retailers on Black Friday and Cyber Monday is not expected to be a feature of Manic Monday, but many more websites than usual are offering free delivery and are pushing the message that goods will be delivered in time for Christmas. Experian Marketing Services senior retail consultant James Miller said: 'Christmas 2014 is on track to be another record breaking year for online retail in the UK. 'Continuing a trend we identified last year, Cyber Monday will no longer be the busiest pre-Christmas online shopping day, with Manic Monday expected to take the lead. 'With increased confidence in the standard of delivery services and click and collect, we expect to see people break away from traditional shopping habits.' Professor Josh Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: 'Manic Monday will be a significant day but I don't expect to see the scale of price cutting that was evident on Black Friday. 'There will still be the discounts but most of the sales will be down to shoppers worried that certain items could be out of stock, as well as making sure they are delivered in time for Christmas.' Starting again: Customers pushed each other out of the way as the crowd surges towards widescreen televisions at the Asda store in Wembley on Black Friday, but Cyber Monday could be even bigger . A Waitrose spokesman told MailOnline that the Heston from Waitrose Ultimate Chocolate Bar has been one of its best pre-Christmas sellers so far. Sales are up 56 per cent week-on-week, and the retail giant said it has had to double its orders for the £9.99 product to keep up with rising demand. In addition, sales last week from Waitrose Cellar – its online wine site - were up 40 per cent on last year as customers stocked up on alcohol.","UK consumers are expected to spend £676million in 24 hours on what is probably busiest online shopping day .

ff745a99861cfe97b8a4d5fdf2072dfdadc75882,"(CNN) -- Over a billion dollars was spent, the English Premier League title was won, its neighbors' feathers were duly ruffled, but the pressure to adapt to European football proved too much for Manchester City says Carlos Tevez. Tevez, who signed for Juventus in a $13 million deal last month, enjoyed four years at City where he helped the club win the FA Cup and a first league title in 44 years, when they pipped rivals Manchester United on the last day of the 2011/2012 season. But it was the club's failure in European competition which left a sour taste in Tevez's mouth with City failing to in their bid to compete with the continent's biggest clubs. City has failed to progress from the Group Stage of Europe's elite competition in each of the past two seasons and the Argentine striker says the pressure and expectation on the players proved too great for the team to handle. ""Yes, there was way too much pressure,"" Tevez told CNN. ""It came from everyone -- the club, the fans. I think that too much pressure just hurts the team. ""What happened was that there so much hype and pressure to be one of the giants of Europe and we didn't do it. ""We dropped out in the first round of the Champions League on both occasions."" City will now hope that new manager Manuel Pellegrini will help to turn its fortunes around following the departure of Roberto Mancini. City's former Italian coach and Tevez endured a difficult relationship with the Argentine's apparent refusal to warm up during a Champions League tie at Bayern Munich in September 2011. Subsequently the Italian announced that Tevez would never play for the club again before finally relenting, but the Argentine says he only has respect for his former manager. ""He's a winner,"" added Tevez. ""I think he's a winner because he always wants to win and he takes his team to the maximum place to be able to win. Everyone who knows Mancini knows that he's a winner from birth."" Tevez's new club, Juventus, last won the Champions League back in 1996 and reached the quarterfinals last season before losing to eventual champion Bayern Munich. The Turin club has not reached the final since it suffered a heartbreaking penalty shootout defeat by Milan in 2003 at Old Trafford. While Antonio Conte's side have won Serie A for the past two years, it is the European crown which the club craves. But Tevez is aware of how such pressure can be detrimental to a team's chances of success with City just one example of how players can be adversely affected. ""I think we have to be calm and make sure we don't put pressure on ourselves to win the Champions League,"" added the 29-year-old as he looked to ahead to the challenge of playing in Europe with Juventus. ""If we don't then that pressure will become impossible to escape from. ""We have to be calm and know that winning the Scudetto again will make us part of Italian history and then we can think about everything else. ""We all dream of winning the Champions League but our main objective is winning Serie A. ""Then we can be calm in the Champions League and everything will become a lot easier.""","Carlos Tevez joined Juventus from Manchester City in $13 million transfer .

The mouse tries to escape but is no match for the bird, which catches it in its talons and flies away with it. Mr Lobanov, 40, from Peresvet in Russia, said it was taking the photographs was a trial. He said: 'It was extremely difficult to get these shots. 'It was really very cold, about -32 degrees and of course I had to be very patient.

But while the world waits for the new smartphone, engineers at the firm's headquarters in Cupertino, California, are busy patenting futuristic features that could one day appear in iPads and iPhones. In a patent granted today, plans are revealed for a mobile device with a flexible screen with hidden buttons beneath its surface. In a patent granted today, plans are revealed for a mobile device with a flexible screen. This image shows how temporary  raised buttons (22) could push upwards under a screen (102) on demand, giving users the feeling of pushing a physical button, like the home button on an iPhone . The patent granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office suggests that buttons and microphones could  be hidden by the screen in a number of ways. In one scenario, future mobile devices would feature physical buttons - such as the Home button - embedded under their displays, which would flex or 'deform' to enable users to push them down, Apple Insider reported. In another scenario, the screen could be placed over actuators - tiny motors. They would press upwards to generate temporary buttons on-demand anywhere on the screen and provide haptic feedback. By hiding 'buttons' under a screen using either method, Apple could expand the size of an iPhone or iPad screen, without making the devices themselves bigger and bulkier. While these functions appear to be predominantly intended for the iPhone and iPad, the patent also shows how the technology could be incorporated into a MacBook’s trackpad, to create ridges (102) and make a future laptop (without a groove on its side) easier to open (pictured) The handset is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday 9 September and will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes. It is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US. The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704x904 resolution. Experts also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera - possibly with changeable lenses -and wireless charging support. It may also include a heart rate sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5. There is increasing demand for phones with larger screens, with Samsung among the manufacturers offering multimedia-friendly Phablets – a cross between a phone and a tablet. Apple is rumoured to be launching its iPhone 6 in two sizes - 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch – to cater to consumers who want a larger screen on their phone. The technology described in the patent could mean that Apple mobile devices of the future are ‘all screen’ and that they could grow or reveal buttons when a user needs them. The patent reads: 'The ability of a user to compress a component such as a button switch by deforming the flexible display may allow the area of a device available for visual display to be enlarged. 'For example, the active area of a flexible display may overlap a component such as a button or speaker.' 'Diaphragms' capable of being used as a speaker or microphone could also be hidden under the screen, according to the patent. While these functions appear to be predominantly intended for the iPhone and iPad, the patent also shows how the technology could be incorporated into a MacBook’s trackpad, to create a large ridge that would push up the laptop's lid. This could mean that future MacBook designs will be more streamlined and that there will no longer be a ridge to open them. As with any patent, there is no indication about whether the technology described really will feature in a future product. By hiding buttons under a screen, Apple could expand the size of an iPhone or iPad screen, without making the devices bigger. Consumers are increasingly demanding larger handsets and the iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in two sizes - 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches. Leaked images of the rumoured handsets are shown .","Patent reveals iPhones and iPads could one day have flexible screens .

Would you be brave enough to spend Halloween sleeping in a cemetery? For one family, this former mortuary chapel surrounded by crumbling headstones and eerie gargoyles is home 365 days of the year. Unperturbed by its spooky statues and proximity to ancient graves, Jayne Stead and her partner Mike Blatchford fell in love with the one-time cemetery keeper's lodge in Southampton, and set about turning it into a home for themselves and their three children. 'Spookiest house in the city': Mike Blatchford and Jayne Stead at home in the former cemetery keeper's lodge with their children (l-r) William, 13, Florence, 15, and Joe, 17 . Eerie: The former cemetery keeper's lodge and chapel in Southampton is home to Jayne, Mike and their three children . Designer Ms Stead admits the couple's decision to move into the former Jewish mortuary chapel - which dates back to the 1800s - raised some eyebrows among their more superstitious friends, but insisted the house has 'a nice feeling'. With the creepiest holiday in the calendar fast approaching, the family has invited local schoolchildren to trick-or-treat at the old chapel this Halloween. Ms Stead said she suspected youngsters have been too afraid to venture down the path leading to the spooky Grade II listed building in previous years. 'We've had plenty of Halloween parties because the house is the perfect venue, but nobody has ventured down here for trick-or-treating before,' she said. 'We are the spookiest house in the city after all.' Atmospheric: Ms Stead said trick-or-treaters have been too afraid to venture down the path to the historic chapel on previous Halloweens . Creepy: The family's living room once housed a mortuary . 'Homely': The couple fell in love with the former chapel and cemetery keeper's lodge and spent £100,000 transforming it into a family home . Modern: Victorian urinals and a tatty storage shed in the ramshackle building became a modern kitchen . While the 52-year-old said she had never seen a ghost in her time in the chapel - which is also home to the couple's children Joe, 17, . Florence, 15, and 13-year-old William - she admitted there have been . some strange occurrences in the living room - once the mortuary. 'The cemetery didn't put us off...we don't spook easily' Jayne Stead . 'I’ve been sitting on my own in the living room and I’ve felt like there was someone standing behind me a few times,' Ms Stead said. 'I’ve also found the dog barking at nothing in the corner of the room, but it’s not scary. 'Mike’s aunt is a medium and when she came to visit us for the first time she the place had a really nice feeling about it.' 'We don't spook easily': The house is the perfect venue for a Halloween party, its owners say . Jayne and self-employed builder Mike, 51, bought the property six years ago when it was put on the market by the council. 'I’ve always loved broken down cottages,' Ms Stead said. 'When we saw this it just seemed perfect. 'It was one of those opportunities where you have to make a snap decision to go for it or not go for it.'The cemetery didn’t put us off. We don’t spook easily, in fact I love watching scary films and television shows. 'When we first had a look around it was really run down, there were graves everywhere but it never really felt scary, there was very nice feeling about the place,' she said. Despite their affection for the old mortuary chapel, Ms Stead admits they rented out their old house rather than selling it to ensure the family had a back-up plan. 'That way if it all went horribly wrong we could move back home,' she said. 'Nobody really knows what it’s going to be like living in a graveyard.' Builder Mr Blatchford spent a year and £100,000 turning the ramshackle property into the family's dream home. The Victorian urinals and tatty storage shed were transformed in to a beautiful, modern kitchen, while the chapel, built in 1845, became the dining room. The old cemetery keeper’s lodge now houses bedrooms, bathrooms, and a playroom. Family home: The historic building has been given a new lease of life by the family, who say its location in a cemetery 'didn't put us off' Ghostly: The family can see headstones and statues when they peer out of the mullioned windows . The interior may have been transformed, but from the outside the building appears to have changed little since its days as a mortuary chapel and cemetery keeper's lodge, with original features including the mullioned windows and gargoyles retained. 'You get people peering in to the windows of the chapel and when they see us watching television they jump a million miles,' said Ms Stead. 'It may be covered in gargoyles and we may be surrounded by graves but on the inside it just looks like a normal house. 'A lot of visitors were wary at first and thought it was spooky but after a while, like us, they forget they’re in a cemetery. 'It's a very homely place.'","The former cemetery keeper's lodge in Southampton is surrounded by crumbling headstones and spooky statues .

ff75c88557cff28237a666eed21038884af81031,"(CNN) -- It was not the sort of meme Bill Cosby wanted to generate. On Monday, the comedian -- or whomever was in charge of his social media -- put out a challenge with a jovial picture of Cosby in a cap: ""Go ahead. Meme me! #cosbymeme."" The Internet immediately reacted, but probably not in the way Cosby expected. ""Claire, have you seen my ... nevermind, found my raping hat!"" tweeted Trill Withers over the cap picture. ""My two favorite things (--) Jell-O pudding & rape,"" tweeted E.J. Coughlin over a photo of Cosby smiling. ""Look at this wacky shirt I'm wearing (--) also I am a serial rapist,"" tweeted Jason Steele over a picture of a thumbs-up Cosby in a patterned shirt. By nightfall, Cosby's original tweet had been pulled from the Web, which led to this conclusion from Jensen Karp: ""If anyone is looking for a job, the Social Media Manager position for @BillCosby is about to open up."" But if Cosby's social media manager has gone underground, in the Internet age -- where nothing ever goes away -- the rape allegations, which Cosby has repeatedly denied, have stubbornly remained in the open. In late October, comedian Hannibal Buress bluntly attacked what he perceived as Cosby's ""smuggest old black man public persona"" by saying, ""Yeah, but you rape women, Bill Cosby, so turn the crazy down a couple notches. 'I don't curse onstage.' Well, yeah, you're (a) rapist, so I'll take you saying lots of m*****f*****s on 'Bill Cosby: Himself' if you weren't a rapist."" A couple weeks later, Cosby was booked on Queen Latifah's talk show, but the allegations reportedly gave the staff ""cold feet,"" according to TMZ. Cosby's booking was ""postponed at his request,"" the website reported in an addendum. (Cosby did do interviews with Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon without incident.) Now comes the social media fiasco. For years, Cosby has denied the rape allegations. In February, after Newsweek ran an interview with one of the purported victims, Tamara Green, Cosby's representative said, ""This is a 10-year-old, discredited accusation that proved to be nothing at the time, and is still nothing."" Nine years ago, when Green was interviewed by Matt Lauer on the ""Today"" show, his lawyer issued a statement: ""Miss Green's allegations are absolutely false. Mr. Cosby does not know the name Tamara Green or (maiden name) Tamara Lucier and the incident she describes did not happen. The fact that she may have repeated this story to others is not corroboration."" In the case of Andrea Constand, who sued Cosby in 2005 over an incident the year before, Cosby says the sex was consensual. CNN has reached out to Cosby's representative for comment on this story, but has yet to hear back. Lawsuit airs allegations . At the time of Constand's lawsuit, Cosby had been in the news for a sexual affair once before. In 1997, a woman named Autumn Jackson claimed to be Cosby's love child. Cosby admitted to a relationship with Jackson's mother but denied paternity. Jackson was later convicted of extortion. However, it wasn't until Constand's lawsuit in 2005 that the comedian was accused of rape. Constand, a staffer for Temple University's women's basketball team, said in her suit that Cosby -- a Temple alum -- had become a mentor to her in the months since they met in 2002. In early 2004, he invited her to his house in suburban Philadelphia. Constand told Cosby she was feeling stressed and Cosby gave her three blue pills, which he described as ""herbal medication,"" according to her suit, which was posted on The Smoking Gun. Then, her ""knees began to shake, her limbs felt immobile, she felt dizzy and weak, and she began to feel only barely conscious,"" the suit continued. Cosby then gave her another drug, she said, and led her to the sofa, where she says she was sexually molested. ""When Plaintiff awoke, her clothes and undergarments were in disarray,"" the suit said. Constand later returned to her native Canada, where she reported the incident to police. Authorities in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, followed up with an investigation, but at the end of February declined to press criminal charges due to a lack of evidence. Cosby's lawyer, Walter M. Phillips Jr., told CNN the allegations were ""utterly preposterous"" and ""plainly bizarre,"" but Cosby later acknowledged his role in the situation. ""Looking back on it, I realize that words and actions can be misinterpreted by another person, and unless you're a supreme being, you can't predict what another individual will do,"" he told the National Enquirer in March 2005. ""I'm not saying that what I did was wrong, but I apologize to my loving wife, who has stood by my side for all these years, for any pain I have caused her. These allegations have caused my family great emotional stress."" Constand filed her civil suit in March 2005. Constand's lawyers said they found 13 Jane Doe witnesses with similar stories. However, Constand's suit was settled in November 2006, and the witnesses were never called. Terms have not been disclosed. Tarnished reputation . As Mark Whitaker's recent Cosby biography makes clear, the man has his demons. He had affairs while on the road and there have been bumps in his long marriage to his wife, Camille. The influence of Bill Cosby . But Whitaker, a former CNN managing editor, told CNN that he didn't feel comfortable airing the rape allegations. ""Basically, I knew that I was going to have to be very careful in what I said about his private life. I felt that way as a journalist and also for legal reasons,"" he said in an interview about the biography. ""In the case of these other allegations, basically because there were no definitive court findings, no independent witnesses, it didn't meet my standard for what I was going to put in the book."" ""I also was very aware that if I just did a she said-he said, and I printed allegations and denials without my own independent reporting, first of all it's not really in the spirit in the book, but also every person who then reviewed or reported on the book would be free to repeat those unconfirmed allegations just because they were in my book. And I just didn't feel comfortable being responsible for that."" Still, the rape allegations are always just a mouse click away. Not long after Constand's accusations hit the media, Tamara Green went public with her claims on ""Today."" A few months later, another Jane Doe, Beth Ferrier, also spoke out. A third woman, Barbara Bowman, came forward in 2006. Green and Bowman both gave interviews to Newsweek in early 2014. How all the controversy has affected Cosby personally is unknown. He's still scheduled to star in an NBC sitcom next year, and his skills as a comedian appear undiminished. Last year's concert movie, ""Far From Finished,"" earned mostly positive reviews, and his recent comedy tour has also received praise. On Saturday night, he appeared at the New York Comedy Festival and played to an appreciative crowd. ""Over the course of a non-stop two hours, he proves himself yet again to be an extraordinarily skilled storyteller, a performer who is acutely aware of his audience and in full of control of the room from start to finish,"" wrote the Guardian's Elise Czajkowski. But his once-sterling reputation has taken a hit. The Washington Post, Salon and The New York Times have all mentioned the rape allegations in stories, criticizing Cosby to varying degrees. And comedian Buress, who later talked about the Cosby allegations on Howard Stern's radio show, said at a St. Louis show that he had asked fellow comedian Dave Chappelle for advice. Chappelle told Buress to talk to Cosby, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. But then Chappelle watched the Buress video. Maybe it's not a good idea after all, he said.","Bill Cosby's ""Meme me"" proposal went awry Monday .

ff75ce0a70fc902a09404b8b65d85c9f1921c975,"(CNN) -- Twitter just made it a little bit harder to be a troll. In the wake of reports about death and rape threats as well as other abuse targeting women as part of the so-called Gamergate movement, Twitter announced Tuesday that it has improved its reporting and blocking features. The changes, Twitter said in a blog post, will make it easier to police, and respond to, bad behavior among its roughly 284 million active users. Particularly on mobile, abuse will be easier to report, requiring less information and simplifying the way a user flags accounts or specific tweets for review. It also will become easier for users to report abuse that they see but were not the targets of themselves. Survey: 40% of Web users have been harassed . The blog post also says Twitter has improved its ""behind the scenes"" procedures to make reviewing and responding to abuse reports faster. Unlike Facebook, which requires that users create accounts using their real names, Twitter allows anonymity. That's why Twitter is sometimes the forum preferred by people who want to harass others. The service has at times come under fire for not doing enough to clamp down on such abuse. In the past few months, Gamergate has been the driving force behind a new wave of nasty, and widely reported, abuse on the site. Ostensibly an effort to improve ethical standards in video-game journalism, it quickly devolved into ugliness, with Web users identifying themselves with the movement targeting female game developers and journalists online.","Twitter has improved tools for reporting abuse .

ff75e00d964bdc9092434b41dee28e31522f5fff,"For almost a century, thousands gathered under the roof of this Edwardian pool to celebrate the golden age of public swimming. Now plants, rust and decay adorn the walls of the Moseley Road Baths in Birmingham, which campaigners are fighting to save from destruction. These stunning images of the 1907 gala pool, which shut in 2003 amid spiralling repair bills, show the depth of heritage which could be lost from what is now one of Britain's oldest surviving facilities of its kind. Scroll down for video . Swimming in decay: The Moseley Road Baths in Birmingham, whose Grade II*-listed Edwardian pool has lain empty for more than a decade, have been captured in a new light by photographer Mike Jones, 27. He said: 'I wanted to get some images before it was too late' Magnificent: The pool opened in 1907 costing £33,000 and many of the original features remain, leading to safety fears as repair bills mount . Rust: One small pool remains open but councillors have warned they cannot afford the £24million to keep the building open - to the fury of campaigners. More than 100 gathered for an art project on the tiled floor last summer and another vowed to chain himself to the building . Photographer Mike Jones, 27, ventured past the 100ft Gothic renaissance terracotta and red brick frontage to capture the haunting decay of one of the city's most beloved buildings in a new light - using coloured torches to give it a haunting hue. The gala pool pictured closed in 2003 amid safety fears and was followed swiftly by Britain's only surviving set of pre-war private 'slipper baths' - 46 of them - which shut in 2004. Now the disused main pool cuts an eerie image. Metal poles line the pool walls once brimming with water and the blue-and-white tiled arches no longer echo with the sound of pattering bare feet. One small pool remains open to the public, but that, too, faces closure within the next few years. Opened on October 30, 1907, at a cost of £32,924, the baths are now the oldest of only three Grade II*-listed swimming pools still operating in Britain. The other two are at the privately-owned RAC Club in London and The National Sports Centre at Crystal Palace, also in London. Eerie: Photographer Mr Jones used coloured torches to produce an unusual effect, leaving silhouettes of ghostly figures under the arches . Disused: Metal poles line the pool walls once brimming with water and the blue-and-white tiled arches no longer echo with the sound of pattering bare feet. The other two Grade II*-listed baths to remain in any operation are both in London, at the RAC Club and Crystal Palace . Trick of the light: With the blue hue created by the photographer, the pool looks almost as though it could still be filled with water . Despite most of the building shutting more than a decade ago, its oak ticket office, spectator gallery, balconettes, steam-heated drying racks and 200,000-litre cast iron cold water storage tank remain much as they were at the turn of the last century. Now the ornate Edwardian building is at the centre of a fierce battle between history-lovers and Birmingham City Council, and has been listed as one of the Victorian Society's ten most endangered buildings in Britain. In 2013 the Labour administration said it could not afford repairs to the building - which would cost £24million just to get into basic working order - and it would be cheaper to build and maintain new leisure centres than keep the crumbling small pool open for the sake of history. One Liberal Democrat councillor, Martin Mullaney, was so angry at the threat to the beloved baths that he vowed to chain himself to the building in protest. Another protest last summer saw 110 swimmers pose as a living 'terracotta army' on the pool's tiled floor holding a banner which declared: 'We want to swim at Moseley Road Baths'. Features: Elsewhere in the pool building are a complete set of steam-heated drying racks, thought to be the best-preserved in Britain . Nook: Corners of the pool building, which has a 100ft red brick and terracotta frontage, remain hidden under the equipment propping it up . Beauty: The ornate building is at the centre of a fierce heritage campaign and was listed as one of the ten most endangered buildings in Britain . The photographer of seven years said: 'Although it's really only one big room, there are lots of interesting details to capture' History: Despite most of the building shutting more than a decade ago, its oak ticket office, spectator gallery and balconettes remain . But campaigners say they are realistic - and would accept an option which makes use of the building's beauty without actually re-filling it with water. Mr Jones, a professional photographer for seven years, said: 'I know that the remaining pool is due to close in the next few years so I wanted to get some images before it was too late. 'I wanted to get something different with my shots so I made a special point of going in the late afternoon when the light was a bit softer. 'As it is winter I knew within an hour or so of me getting there it would be dark enough to use torches to really make the photos look good.' He added: 'I've photographed quite a few abandoned and disused places over the past seven years, some buildings are really spectacular and this one is no exception. 'I was in there about three hours as getting around in the dark, as well as trying to get each picture perfect, was quite time consuming. 'Although it's really only one big room, there are lots of interesting details to capture and I think the pictures do the stunning architecture justice.' Modernity: There are a few reminders that the pool was open to the public until 2003 - such as this Speedo lap timer clock . Walkways: The grandoise paths to the spectator galleries have fallen silent, but in swimming's golden age would have teemed with people . Shared story: Dozens of pools have closed across Britain in the last few years since the decline of the age of baths and lidos . Uncertain: The future of the main room is yet to be mapped out, and its use could preserve the architecture without refilling the gala pool .","Campaigners fighting to save Birmingham's Grade II*-listed Moseley Road Baths after gala pool shut in 2003 .

ff7672f15b344e93c02d0d3b9676b8070a735e93,"New York (CNN) -- Emergency crews on Wednesday rescued two window washers who were trapped on a hanging platform dangling perilously at the 68th floor of the 1,776-foot One World Trade Center building in lower Manhattan. Rescue workers used a diamond saw to tear through three layers of glass panes -- the thickest nearly two inches -- to pull the workers to safety about 2:15 p.m., authorities said. The men were taken to Bellevue Hospital Center with mild hypothermia, police said. The workers had been tethered inside the apparatus, fire officials said. Additional personal safety cables were lowered from the roof of the 104-story building. ""I see two heads dangling over the scaffolding and one of the guys -- they just keep looking down,"" Reginald Moye, who watched the incident unfold from the 24th floor of a nearby hotel, told CNN. ""They look like they're maybe five feet in the middle of the scaffold, hanging."" A cable on one side of the hanging platform developed slack, leaving it suspended in a near-vertical position, authorities said. The cause was under investigation. The men were identified as Juan Lizama, 41, of New Jersey, and Juan Lopez, 33, of the Bronx, according to 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union, which represents about 600 window cleaners in New York City. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said emergency personnel from the NYPD, the New York Fire Department and Port Authority police practiced a rescue from such a rig 10 days ago. ""They were more than ready to operate here,"" he told reporters. ""The result: two men are going to go home tonight."" But it wasn't easy. ""In this case, the glass is three layers thick and, of course, they're 68 stories up,"" Nigro said. ""It does present a little more of a challenge."" Television images showed the rig dangling precipitously at a sharp angle. A Twitter photo from the fire department showed the rig as seen from inside the tower, with New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty in the distance. Officials said emergency workers communicated with the window washers via a portable radio lowered by rope from the roof. The men worked for a company called Upgrade, according to Erica Dumas, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ""They were going up, washing the windows, and I was amazed at the view,"" Moye said. ""Wow. Such a dangerous job. So, suddenly, I didn't see it collapse, but once I looked over and said, something is wrong, it was dangling."" Officials at Tractel, the company that designed, built and installed the window-washing rig, had no comment. Tractel also designed the scaffolding that collapsed at the Hearst Tower in Manhattan in June 2013, according to aerial and CNN footage of both scenes. In the 2013 incident, two workers were rescued more than 550 feet above the streets of midtown Manhattan after their scaffolding buckled near the top of the tower, fire officials said. The workers, who spent 90 minutes dangling near the top of the building, suffered no injuries. Firefighters cut through a double-paned window on the 45th floor and brought the workers in through the newly created hole. At 1,776 feet tall, the One World Trade Center building surpassed Chicago's 1,451-foot Willis Tower as the nation's tallest building. The new building officially opened November 3, when the first tenant, publishing company Conde Nast, moved in. Many of the floors remain unoccupied. It is the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, with a 408-foot spire atop the 1,368 foot tower. Its predecessor, the Twin Towers, were destroyed 13 years ago when al Qaeda terrorists flew two hijacked passenger jets into the buildings, killing 2,753 people on September 11, 2001. Asked if emotions surrounded the rescue, fire department Lt. Billy Ryan said: . ""It's business. The task at hand is what you worry about. You separate yourself from that. This is business.""

But one day, cars could detect whether a driver’s voice sounds drunk, to stop them from driving and prevent accidents. Researchers in Germany have created the first library of drunk speech patterns, which could be used to predict drunkenness by listening for vocal cues. Scroll down for video . Researchers in Germany have created the first library of drunk speech patterns, which could be used to predict drunkenness in cars (Illustrated with a stock image) Called the Alcohol Language Corpus, the database was made between 2007 and 2009 by giving people too much alcohol to drink, before recording conversations conducted in a stopped car, where the drunk person was sitting in the passenger seat. There are currently conversations from 162 German men and women in the publicly-available audio database. Experts at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Institute of Legal Medicine in the city collected the data, FastCompany reported. From this, an algorithm that is capable of detecting whether someone is drunk by listening in on slurring speech patterns, has been created by computer scientists at Queens College and Columbia University. Scientists have used the library to create an algorithm that can predict if a driver is drunk. The hope is that it could be built into cars to stop people putting their key in the ignition and driving off. The technology would act as a preventative measure, unlike breathalysers (pictured) that are used by the police to prove an offence . Just three hours behind the wheel at night can make motorists drive as badly as if they were drunk, scientists claim. Driver tiredness after a few hours has the same effect as being over the drink-driving limit, a 2011 study revealed. Even two hours of motorway driving in the dark can affect performance so severely it is the same as having a couple of drinks. It's estimated that one-fifth of all traffic accidents are due to sleepiness behind the wheel and one in three people admit to nodding off while driving at night. They found that they could detect drunken speech patterns much like identifying an accent. Drunken speech hallmarks include stammering and stuttering. Voices also tend to rise in pitch and words begin to slur, they said. It is hoped that the software could be used alongside devices such as locks and immobilisers to make it impossible for people to drive when drunk – perhaps by asking them a few questions while analysing the driver’s voice. ‘The cars themselves could listen to the driver, detect that the potential driver is intoxicated, and prevent the car from starting,’ the researchers explained. However, the safety system may be a few years away, because the algorithm to detect drunkenness is typically only right around three quarters of the time. ‘That means, you want to go and drive your car, one in three times we're going to say you're drunk. That's bad for a product,’ Professor Andrew Rosenberg, of Queens College New York (CUNY) said. The next step is to add more languages to the library so that more experts can use the public library for their own research.","German researchers have created the first library of drunk speech patterns .

Just four of the 58 staff expected to report for duty at the Hilton Hotel in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, showed up, one of whom later disappeared. In Salford, Greater Manchester, only 17 of the 56 G4S staff due at another Olympic team hotel could be bothered to present themselves for work. Security: Police inspect a car outside a Manchester hotel which had been due to be guarded by G4S staff . Filling in: Police officers stand guard at the Marriot Worsley Park hotel in Manchester to protect athletes after G4S workers failed to appear . Home Secretary Theresa May admitted yesterday that she has no idea how many G4S staff will turn up for work – raising the prospect that thousands more soldiers may have to be deployed, on top of the 3,500 who have already been called up. ‘The precise balance of the numbers that they will be providing will become clear over the next few days,’ she told MPs. The political pressure was also growing last night as a series of leaked documents revealed that some officials have known of the problem for at least three months. Mrs May claimed that ministers were told only last week that G4S could not deliver the 10,000 security guards it promised. But she was directly contradicted by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who said: ‘Everyone that was organising the Olympics knew this was coming up ages ago.’ An internal G4S memo leaked last night revealed that the company’s bosses deliberately failed to train people early because it would not be ‘cost-effective’. In the document, obtained by Channel 4 News and dated June 29, Mark Hamilton, then head of Olympic security, wrote: ‘It would have been an advantage to have everyone trained months in advance but this was neither practical nor cost-effective.’ Gaps: Only 17 of an expected 56 G4S security staff turned up for work at the hotel, Greater Manchester Police Federation said . Yesterday, several hundred officers from nine police forces were being drafted in to plug gaps left by G4S. West Midlands Police Federation chairman Ian Edwards said his force has had to provide 150 officers per day to cover a hotel in Warwickshire where Olympic footballers are staying, and could need to provide hundreds more at other venues. He said: ‘It’s chaos, absolute chaos. You shouldn’t lose your local police officer because of the Olympics.’ The position of G4S chief executive Nick Buckles – due to give evidence to a Commons select committee today – looked increasingly perilous last night. G4S could lose more than £700million of future Government work – including running prisons and police stations – after its reputation was tarnished by the debacle. Base: Athletes have been staying at the Marriot Worsley Park hotel in Manchester with police protection . Ring of steel: Armed police and soldiers guard the Olympic Village in Portland, Dorset, where sailing events are to be held. Dorset Police is one of nine forces deploying extra officers to fill the gap left by G4S . Target: The Olympic village in Portland is among several Games venues which will have to be patrolled by extra police officers . A collapse in its share price has seen some £600million wiped from the value of the company since the guard shortfall emerged last week, and it has already admitted it will make a £50million loss on the Olympics contract. City analyst Mike Allen, of broking house Panmure Gordon, said: ‘I’m sure that one or two heads are going to have to roll for this.’ G4S chairman John Connolly said: ‘We don’t want to do anything that smacks of short-term expediency, but it would be right to consider whether any members of the senior team are best placed to take the company forward.’ But Mr Buckles could walk away with a bulging pension pot and company shares worth £21million. Arrival: A group of soldiers from the Royal Regiment of Scotland march in front of the Olympic stadium. Extra military personnel have been drafted in after G4S failed to provide enough security guards . Monitoring: Three soldiers survey the Olympic Park as the massive security operation gets under way . Downing Street confirmed that the Government’s Cobra crisis committee would now meet every day – often under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister – throughout the Olympics to prevent further security disasters. Last night it emerged that officials were sufficiently worried to commission an audit of whether G4S could deliver on its promises. A source told ITV news the audit was seen by the Home Office and Games organisers Locog. The audit dated April 23, said: ‘Clearly the training operation is very frustrated at not being able to put through the required numbers, and viewing with trepidation the inevitable last-minute nature of the mass throughput that will be the consequence.’ The audit found that attendance at training events was just 60 per cent of ‘planned capacity.' Last laugh? Mr Buckles could take home a package . of up to £21million in bonuses, shares and pension if he is forced to . quit the company over the guard-recruitment fiasco . Vigilant: Soldiers in high-visibility vests man an entry point to the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London .

ff77bfb0358a3bfc412700da576e9e9128122fad,"Bekoji, Ethiopia (CNN) -- It might be many miles away from the usual sporting capitals of the world, but when it comes to long-distance running there's one tiny place that's setting the pace. Nestled amidst rolling farmlands on the green hills of southern central Ethiopia, Bekoji is a sleepy town of less than 20,000 people, most of whom are farmers and herders. But apart from the wheat and maize growing on Bekoji's fertile soil, this small town a few hours south from capital Addis Ababa is also the breeding ground for some of the best track and field athletes in the world. Set at about 2,800 meters above sea level, Bekoji has produced a string of Olympic champions and world-beating long-distance runners, including multiple Olympic gold medal winners Tirunesh Dibaba and Kenenisa Bekele. Sentayehu Eshetu, the legendary coach who has so far trained four of Bekoji's Olympic gold winners, says that a winning mix of thin air, lean diet and different terrains has helped the town's rich crop of runners stand out in recent years. ""Our training fields are very conducive for athletics,"" says Eshetu, 56, who is known in Bekoji simply as ""Coach."" ""We have downhill, flat land, all of these here in Bekoji. The food they eat also has an impact, the weather has an impact, the combination of these makes the kids successful."" Read this: Senegalese teens shoot for U.S. glory . Eshetu is quick to add, however, that favorable weather and training conditions do not guarantee success. Determination and dedication are key, he says. ""Our runners are successful because they work hard,"" he explains. ""They work with the aim of reaching for success. This is what makes them different."" And if there's anyone who should know about success, that's Eshetu. For some 25 years he has been discovering and nurturing the talents of some the finest runners in Ethiopia -- a global powerhouse in long-distance running, with 35 Olympic medals in the last 20 years. Apart from Dibaba and Bekele, Eshetu has also trained Derartu Tulu, a two-time Olympic champion, Tiki Gelana, the marathon winner at the 2012 London Olympics, Tirfi Tsegaye, winner of the recent 2013 Dubai Marathon, and many others. Read this: Cameroon's outspoken football star . Using a blue-walled mud hut as an office and Bekoji's fields as training grounds, Eshetu spots, coaches and mentors scores of local youngsters who follow his rigorous routine in the hope of running their way from Bekoji to international stardom. ""When I recruit athletes, I look at those who have a desire to put in the work,"" says Eshetu. ""I look at their shape. Kids who are too short won't have good results. Those who are tall walk upright and those who complete their training with passion, I recruit them. ""They train here for three years after entering the camp. After three years, those with good results move on to other clubs. After that, based on their time, they compete in other races, even international ones."" But for the majority of these young athletes, this is not an easy road. Poverty is common, sporting equipment does not come cheap and most get by on no more than two meals a day. ""Here athletes have difficulty with getting regular food, with owning shoes, they face a lot of problems,"" says Eshetu. ""They have to sew their shoes, manage with little food, work long and hard, but I believe this allows them to become stronger and successful."" Read this: NBA boss finding Africa's basketball stars . Eshetu's golden girl is three-time Olympic champion Dibaba, a member of a sporting family dynasty that includes four successful long-distance athletes. Last summer, as Dibaba sprinted through the finish line to win gold in the 10,000 meters at the London Olympics, Eshetu was watching proudly on a screen thousands of miles away. ""Sentayehu knew that my cousin Derartu Tulu ran,"" says Dibaba. ""He knew that my sisters ran too, that's why he encouraged me to start running. He used to tell me that I would be a great runner. He knew I would be a fast runner that's why he started coaching me."" For Dibaba, representing a country with such a distinguished athletics history brings a feeling of great responsibility. ""Our country is not like other countries,"" says Dibaba. ""You should bring back gold when you compete for Ethiopia. The people don't accept anything less, the people won't be happy with anything less. ""Silver and bronze in our country is no better than finishing fifth or sixth. I want to make people happy and therefore think of finishing first. My heart pounds when I think of this, and that why I train hard, to make the people happy."" Driven by a strong sense of duty and a strong desire to produce successful athletes, Eshetu shows no signs of stopping. Instead, he's always keeping an eye out for the next rising star to come out of Bekoji's rich crop. ""Running for Ethiopia is a movement that has shown the world where we are, what we can do and who we are as a people,"" says Eshetu.","Ethiopian long-distance runners have won 35 Olympic medals in the last 20 years .

ff781e5a41a16f743cd881274b3da144d3f81e1f,"Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber said Friday his fiancée will have no role in his administration for the rest of his fourth term after questions were raised about her consulting work. Visibly nervous as he addressed reporters with a shaky voice, Kitzhaber said Cylvia Hayes would continue her consulting business but would not work for organizations that 'have anything to do with the state of Oregon.' The Democratic governor has been on the defensive about Hays' work since newspapers first raised questions in October surrounding her consulting for organizations that want to influence the state. Addressing concerns: Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber answers questions during a news conference in Portland. Kitzhaber said that legitimate questions have been raised about his fiancee's taxes . Speaking out: Governor John Kitzhaber, 68, acknowledges legitimate questions have been raised about Cylvia Hayes, 47, taxes . 'These issues have become such a distraction that I want to make it very, very clear that she will have no policy role and no political role in the administration during the remaining four years of my term,' Kitzhaber said at a news conference at a state office building in Portland. Hayes played an active role in Kitzhaber's third term, attending meetings, communicating with state officials and helping him push for environmental and clean energy policies. At the same time, she did consulting work for several organizations involved in similar policies. He previously said her role would be re-evaluated but hadn't ruled out her continuing involvement in his administration. Kitzhaber was forced to respond to new reports this week in state newspapers that Hayes was paid $118,000 over two years for a fellowship with a green energy group — money that may not have been reported on her taxes. Kitzhaber said legitimate questions have been raised but he wouldn't address them. Keeping quiet: Reports showed that income from a renewable energy group didn't appear on Cylvia Hayes tax returns. The  governor said he and Cylvia Hayes file taxes separately and would not discuss hers . Blinded by love: Governor Kitzhaber, pictured dancing with Hayes who is 20 years his junior, will answer questions on Friday  morning - two weeks into his fourth term as governor - over her undeclared earnings . 'Cylvia and I file separate returns. I have not reviewed, did not prepare and cannot answer questions concerning her tax returns, and those questions need to be directed specifically to Cylvia,' Kitzhaber said. As Kitzhaber dodged rapid-fire questions from a large contingent of media, Hayes was in Sweden on Friday visiting friends at her own expense, he said. She has been unavailable to comment on the tax issue. She'll travel later to Berlin for meetings with an organization that promotes using happiness to evaluate the success of economies and public policies. The organization, funded by the German government, is paying for her trip. It also paid for Hayes' 2013 travel with Kitzhaber to study happiness indicators in Bhutan. Kitzhaber repeatedly deflected questions about whether her work constituted a conflict of interest, saying the Oregon Government Ethics Commission will decide. At one point, he compared himself to Marshawn Lynch, the Seattle Seahawks running back who spent an entire Super Bowl press conference answering every question with the same response. Kitzhaber insists that he and Hayes worked hard to draw a clear separation between her public and private duties and to properly declare conflicts where they existed. Honorable intentions: Governor Kitzhaber is sworn in for an unprecedented fourth term in Oregon on January 12 this year next to his fiancés, Cylvia Hayes . 'That was our intent, and the ethics commission will make a determination as to whether or not we were successful,' Kitzhaber said. Asked whether he's been blinded by love, he said he does not believe he is. He said he still plans to marry Hayes, to whom he proposed last summer, and has no intention of resigning. 'I'm not going to consider resigning, of course not,' Kitzhaber said. 'I was elected by the people of this state to do a job and I'm going to do it.' Hayes has been under intense scrutiny over her business and embarrassing revelations of her past personal life. Last fall, following a newspaper report, she acknowledged that in the 1990s she illegally married an Ethiopian immigrant so he could seek residency in the United States, and that she had never told Kitzhaber about the sham marriage that ended with the filing of divorce papers in 2001. The controversy comes as Kitzhaber gears up for the five-month legislative session during which he's pushing an ambitious agenda on education and climate change, a priority for Hayes. Hayes admitted in an email to the East Oregonian that she had been paid the money by CEDC. Daily Mail Online was awaiting a comment from CEDC on Friday. The paper also confirmed that she did not disclose $88,000 in tax filings for 2012 - claiming her income  was just over $27,000 from her own business venture, 3E Strategies. The paper reported that since Kitzhaber was sworn in as governor in 2011, his fiancée has pulled in around $213,000 in consulting fees. According to her first lady biography on Oregon.gov, Hayes has 22 years of experience working in clean energy and has served as a member and co-chair of the Oregon Renewable Energy Working Group. Her own consulting firm, 3E Strategies, had led to an ethics investigation, following complaints. Living the life: Hayes, who became engaged to her older lover last year, lives with Kitzhaber in the lavish governor's mansion in Oregon . In November, the Oregon Government Ethics Commission opened a preliminary investigation into Hayes' consulting work. The commission received three complaints about Hayes' work as a private consultant. The preliminary investigation was to determine whether the commission should proceed with a full-fledged inquiry that could lead to sanctions. The commission also rejected Kitzhaber's request for an advisory opinion about whether ethics laws apply to Hayes, whom he first met in 2002. Officials said the questions asked by the governor's office will be addressed in the investigation. Kitzhaber said Hayes carefully avoided conflicts of interest. Among those who filed ethics complaints were the Republican state party and a Republican state representative. A decision will be made on March 13 on whether a full investigation will take place.","Governor John Kitzhaber acknowledges legitimate questions have been raised about her Cylvia Hayes, 47, taxes .

The arrests come months after five members of the group, known as the Church of Almighty God or ""Quannengshen"", were charged with the brutal killing in May of a woman in a McDonald's restaurant while they were allegedly trying to recruit her. A report by state news agency Xinhua said that the group, which Beijing regards as a dangerous doomsday cult, cheated people, illegally collected money and ""violated the law under the guise of religion."" ""A series of acts by its members have harmed people's lives and property, and disrupted social stability,"" Xinhua said. The report added that members of the cult, also known as ""Eastern Lightning,"" were responsible for ""numerous"" suicides and murders, including those of their own family. Among those arrested were nearly 100 ""backbone members"", Xinhua said. IN DEPTH: 'Eastern Lightning': The banned religious group that has China worried . In May, a 37-year-old woman was beaten to death in the fast food outlet in the eastern province of Shandong. The case triggered a wave of revulsion toward the group on Chinese social media. ""She was a demon,"" one of the suspects, Zhang Lidong, said in television interview following his arrest. ""She was an evil spirit."" Five adults have been charged with murder, and their trial begins on Thursday, Xinhua said. The group has been on a list of 14 banned religious groups issued by China's Ministry of Public Security since 1995. According to Chinese media reports, it has been responsible for a spate of robberies, assaults and kidnappings. In 2012, hundreds of members were rounded up after the group publicly proclaimed the end of the world was imminent. In a statement provided to CNN in June, members of the group responsible for its English-language website said it was ""very natural"" for the Chinese Communist Party to blame the group for the McDonald's death because the Party slandered and then suppressed those that disagreed with it. ""They always find some excuse in advance and fabricate things and slander them,"" said the statement. Founded in the 1990s in central China, the group believes that Jesus has been reincarnated as Yang Xiangbin, the wife of the group's founder, Zhao Weishan. The couple fled to the United States in 2000, Xinhua reported.","Almost 1,000 members of a banned religious group arrested in China .

Former NYPD commissioner Bernard Kerik has accused his former attorney of working with federal agents to put him behind bars in 2010 for taking bribes from mobsters. Kerik, a 9/11 hero, was one of the city's most beloved commissioners and on track to be the head of Homeland Security but that changed the day he plead guilty to accepting $165,000 in apartment renovations from the mob-connected DiTommaso family who wanted a city contract. He hired high-profile lawyer and personal friend Joe Tacopina to represent him but by the time the case made it to court, his attorney was serving as a witness for the prosecution. Betrayed: Former NYPD Commissioner Bernard Kerik (left) is suing his former attorney Joe Tacopina (right) for working with federal prosecutors behind his back . Career over: Kerik nearly became President Bush's director of Homeland Security but lost the opportunity when the organized crime connections surfaced . Kerik served four years of prison time in Maryland and was released this past May seemingly hell bent on vengence since he filed a bar complaint against Tacopina Friday. In the complaint, Kerik accuses Tacopina of engaging in 'conduct involving dishonest, fraud, deceit, and/or misrepresentation' in addition to several legal abuses. He says that Tacopina met with federeal prosecutors behind his back, giving them information that would help bring him down. Additionally Tacopina put Kerik in danger of being arrested by contacting him after it was announced that he would be on the witness list. Connections: Kerik pleaded guilty to accepting $165,000 in home renovations from Frank (left) and Peter (right) DiThommaso, from an organized crime connected family . Kerik also accuses Tacopina of attempting to defraud him of a seven-figure finder's fee in a real estate transaction. Steroid use: Tacopino is currently representing Yankee star Alex Rodriguez as he seeks to get his 211-game ban reduced . Following the new complaint, Tacopina shot back at Kerik in the New York Post calling the allegations unsubstantiated old news. 'This is such bulls***, reheated dog food,' Tacopina said. Tacopina's attorney was a little less candid with his denials. 'If any of these allegations were true, Mr Tacopina would have at least been subjected to discipline,' Washington-based attorney Lanny Davis said in a statement to the New York Daily News. 'Yet Mr Tacopina in 22 years of law practice has never received a bar complaint, let alone any discipline. Mr Tacopina's spotless record with the bar speaks far louder than the lies and innuendo that are being spread by those with an obvious agenda.' Tacopina is currently representing Yankee star Alex Rodriguez as he attempts to get his 211-game ban for testing positive for steroid use reduced. Boston attorney Raymond Mansolillo is representing Kerik in the bar case, and says his client may also file a malpractice suit against Tacopina. 'We'll assess the information that we've gleaned and we'll determine which avenue to take.

Once they were destined for the slaughterhouse. At least there the end would have been swift. Now it is drawn out and agonising. Dumped without food and water by their owners, thousands of horses which would have been sold for meat are instead being condemned to a living hell. Their plight is highlighted in a report by charities and animal sanctuaries, which are struggling with an influx of horses in appalling condition after unscrupulous dealers, hit by a slump in demand following the horsemeat scandal, abandoned them. Take Nemo. She was so emaciated when animal welfare charity workers rescued her that her ribs poked through her coat. She was also lame. Nemo was just a skeleton when she was rescued but has now made a full recovery . Around her in her muddy field lay the corpses of other horses which had not made it. Rescuers got there just in time for Nemo. With veterinary treatment, she made a full recovery at a sanctuary and eight months on from being taken from that field in Caerphilly, south Wales, she is today a popular addition to HorseWorld’s visitor centre in Bristol. But others have not been so lucky. Watson was being ‘flygrazed’ – a practice where owners, often from the travelling community, leave horses to graze on other people’s land without permission – on a patch of scrub. In his desperation for food he ate something toxic, leading to a skin condition that left him with burnt-raw pink patches. He was neglected for so long that he also had maggots eating away at his body. Vets battled to save the nine-month-old but three days after he was found in a Bristol field in June, he suffered massive kidney and liver failure and died. In total, some 7,000 horses are considered ‘at risk’, according to the report by leading charities including the RSPCA and Blue Cross, with the horsemeat scandal a significant factor, but with over-breeding and the recession also playing a part. Rescue centres have seen a rise of up to 40 per cent in admissions since it was revealed in January that some supermarket food labelled as beef contained horse. Experts say there are owners who let their horses breed indiscriminately then become overwhelmed with the numbers produced. Watson was left to die after developing a skin condition when he ate something toxic. Sadly he died of kidney and liver failure three days after being found . But whereas the unwanted horses might once have gone to the meat trade, now their owners abandon them rather than pay up to £100 a week to care for and feed them. The Animal Sanctuary, in Dorney, Buckinghamshire, is caring for a third more horses than this time last year and is spending more than ever on vets’ bills as many arrive in a horrific condition. Head trustee Diana Coad said: ‘Before the horsemeat scare there was, sadly, a trade in horses for meat but now there’s no market for them. ‘People don’t want to pay to feed them or pay to have them put down, so unscrupulous owners are hiding them away in pockets of land and leaving them to starve very slowly and painfully to death.’ She said so many horses were arriving on the doorstep they were having to turn them away. ‘In just one day last week we had calls about six separate horses, two skeletal horses were brought to us that we took in, and one horse arrived on a trailer in such a bad state that it collapsed and had to be put down,’ she said. Diana Coad head trustee of The Animal Sanctuary in Dorney, Berkshire, says unwanted animals are being hidden and allowed to starve to death by owners who don't want to pay to have them put down . ‘We try to take the worst ones that we can give a chance to and hope the better ones will survive a bit longer. You feel like an executioner having to choose which ones to take, I don’t think anyone would like to make that life or death decision.’ Before the recession, the sanctuary was able to rehome a horse every month but in the last two years it has found a new home for just one pony, as families are choosing cheaper pets. Other animal charities have also seen a huge rise in the number of abandoned horses. World Horse Welfare, in Blackpool, took in 40 per cent more in the first quarter of 2013 than in the same period last year and investigated 22 per cent more complaints about horse welfare. Blue Cross admitted 16 per cent more horses between January and March this year than the year before, with four in ten being admitted for welfare concerns, compared with  less than a third last year.","Nemo was found in south Wales with ribs poking through skin .

ff797b5e8d701a02041a6a501c19f06cf84193cf,"(CNN) -- Merrill Newman -- the 85-year-old American detained by North Korean authorities earlier this fall -- has been ""deported,"" North Korea's state news agency KCNA reported early Saturday. His son announced late Friday that he is on his way home to the United States. ""We are absolutely delighted to confirm that Merrill Newman is on his way home,"" Jeff Newman said. A senior Obama administration official said soon after the North Korean announcement that U.S. authorities have Newman ""in hand."" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf subsequently tweeted that U.S. Embassy officials met ""Newman at the airport in Beijing and provided all appropriate consular assistance."" Video showed him smiling as he walked past a cavalcade of reporters through the Chinese capital's airport. The out-of-the-blue release became all the more real for Newman's relatives in the United States shortly before 8 p.m. (11 p.m. ET), when they talked with Merrill by phone, his family said. The KCNA report stated that investigators determined that ""Newman entered the DPRK with a wrong understanding of it and perpetrated a hostile act against it."" ""Taking into consideration his admittance of the act committed by him on the basis of his wrong understanding (and the) apology made by him for it, his sincere repentance of it and his advanced age and health condition, the above-said institution deported him from the country from a humanitarian viewpoint,"" the official North Korean report added. On Thursday, Harf said American officials had spoken the previous day with relatives of Newman and Kenneth Bae, another American being held in North Korea, but added little else. Hours later, Harf issued a statement saying Washington was ""pleased that Mr. Merrill Newman has been allowed to depart the DPRK and rejoin his family."" ""We welcome the DPRK's decision to release him. This positive decision by the DPRK throws into sharper relief the continuing detention of ... Bae,"" she added. ""... We call on the DPRK once again to pardon and grant Mr. Bae special amnesty and immediately release him as a humanitarian gesture so that he too can return home to his family."" Coincidence or not, the news of Newman's release came on the day that Vice President Joe Biden was in South Korea, where he was to lay a wreath at a memorial for veterans of the war that pitted North Korea against its southern neighbor as well as the United States. Biden told reporters in South Korea that he ""played no direct role"" in the release. He added that his office offered to let Newman fly home with him on Air Force Two, but State Department officials said he'd take a direct commercial flight to San Francisco. ""It's a positive thing they've done,"" said the vice president, who talked Saturday morning by phone with Newman, according to another Obama administration official. ""But they still have Mr. Bae, who has no reason being held in the North (and) should be released immediately."" Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, who has undertaken private diplomatic efforts with North Korea seemed more perturbed over Newman's detention than he was pleased at his release. ""While the release of Merrill Newman is welcome news indeed, he never should have been detained in the first place. The North Koreans should also release Kenneth Bae as a humanitarian gesture,"" Richardson said in a statement. According to his family, Newman went on a 10-day organized private tour of North Korea in October. From phone calls and postcards he sent, the trip was going well and there was no indication of any kind of problem, son Jeff Newman said. The day before the Palo Alto, California, resident was to leave, ""one or two Korean authorities"" met with Newman and his tour guide, the son added. They talked about Newman's service record, which left ""my dad ... a bit bothered,"" according to Jeff Newman. Then, just minutes before his Beijing-bound plane was set to depart Pyongyang in late October, he was taken off the aircraft by North Korean authorities. For weeks, the Pyongyang government didn't explain why they were holding Newman. An explanation came a few days ago, when state media published and broadcast what they described as the Korean War veteran's ""apology."" In fact, that word -- ""apology"" -- was written atop the first of four handwritten pages detailing his alleged indiscretions. In the note -- which was dated November 9 -- Newman talked about his having advised the Kuwol Unit, part of the ""intelligence bureau"" fighting against Pyongyang during the Korean War. He detailed how he commanded troops to collect ""information"" and wage various deadly attacks. ""After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people,"" Newman said, according to that KCNA report. The reported message also touched on his return 60 years later to North Korea, admitting that he ""shamelessly ... had a plan to meet any surviving soldiers and pray for the souls of the dead soldiers."" His statement ended: ""If I go back to (the) USA, I will tell the true features of the DPRK and the life the Korean people are leading."" This public apology -- which University of California, Berkeley, professor Steve Weber characterized as ""highly scripted political theater"" -- left some wondering what would happen to Newman. Would he join Bae, an American arrested in North Korea in November 2012 who last May was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor after North Korea's government found him guilty of ""hostile acts"" and attempts to topple the government? Or would he be released? As Weber said days ago: ""When it comes to North Korea, nobody knows very much."" Pyongyang has long been regarded by many as a repressive state, with its insularity, sharp restrictions on speech and other freedoms, and decades of saber-rattling primarily targeting its chief foes, South Korea and the United States. Its isolation is exacerbated by widespread uproar over its nuclear program. The East Asian nation's reported quest to create a nuclear weapon, as well as its resistance to international monitoring of its activities, have resulted in economic sanctions, compounding difficulties in getting enough energy and food for its people. But there have been some indications of change of late. Is Newman's release signal even more of an opening by Pyongyang? Will it lead to even more of a thaw? Given the ups and mostly downs in these relationships, it's hard to tell now what will happen. Still, this news affects the global political landscape, at the least it appears that the Newman family -- including Merrill's wife, Lee, who last month told CNN that ""we need to have Merrill back at the head of the table for the holidays"" -- should be complete once again. CNN's Jill Dougherty and Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","NEW: Newman's son confirms that the released American is on his way home .

A little girl, 8, suffering from a neurological disorder wrote a heartwarming letter to an injured police offer who was shot in the chest. Abby Holbrook, of Loveland, Colorado sent local police officer Garret Osilka a letter to make him feel better after he was shot during a March traffic stop. Abby suffers from an autoimmune condition similar to multiple sclerosis called transverse myeliti. At one point in her sickness, she was paralyzed from the neck down. Abby Holbrook and Officer Garrett Osilka met after Holbrook, who suffers from a disease, wrote him a heart warming letter telling him he will heal after being shot . Abby Holbrook, pictured, suffers from transverse myeliti and goes to the hospital often for brain surgeries . Abby, seen here resting in a hospital bed, must also undergo bladder surgeries and has one scheduled for next week . Though Abby did not know Osilka personally before reaching out to him, 'She wanted to give him a gift,' mother Carrie Holbrook said. Abby sent Osilka a St. Christopher medal along with the letter. 'Dear Officer Osilka, I know how it feels to hurt really bad. I'm in the hospital, and Chief Hecker is my friend, so that makes you my friend. I hope you feel better soon. I got this medal because St. Christopher will help protect you from bad guys. Love, Abby,' said the letter. 9News reports that Abby goes to the hospital for brain surgeries often and that gifts always make her feel a little bit better. In addition to painful brain surgeries, Abby must undergo bladder surgeries and has one scheduled for next week. Loveland Police Chief Luke Hecker, referenced in the letter, is a family friend of the Holbrooks, the station adds. Hecker even delivered the gifts to Osilka on Abby's behalf and told him about Abby's condition. Osilka asked if he could visit Abby, which he later did. This is Abby Holbrook's inspiring letter to Officer Osilka telling him that St.Christopher will protect him and that she's in the hospital so she knows what it is like to feel pain . Abby sent Osilka a St. Christopher medal along with her heartwarming letter . Referring to Abby, injured police officer Garret Osilka said 'In my mind, she's tougher than I am' Abby's mom Carrie Holbrook believes this will be the beginning of a long and special friendship for her daughter and injured officer Garret Osilka . 'It was very, very sweet,' Carrie Holbrook said told the station. Holbrook believes that this will be the beginning of a very long and special friendship. 'It was a super, special letter obviously,' Osilka told 9News. 'That's why I wanted to come see you afterwards.' Osilka is currently healing from his injuries, which include both the gunshot wound as well as psychological trauma. The 'bad guy' Abby refers to in her letter, who police suspect is 23-year-old Cody Powell, was charged with suspicion of attempted first-degree murder in early March. He was arrested after police linked a vehicle, either a blue or black Jeep Cherokee with temporary plates occupied by two people to the scene of the crime, Westword.com reports. Powell turned himself in at a Loveland Walmart. Osilka told 9news that even though he suffered an injury while on his sometimes frightening job, he believes that Abby is even stronger than he is. 'I kind of picked my profession,' he said. 'It's not a choice that she made. In my mind, she's tougher than I am.' A GoFundMe account to help raise funds for Abby's medical expenses is viewable here.

An influential astrophysicist hired by DC Comics to pinpoint the location of Superman’s home planet, Krypton, has done just that. The fictional planet Krypton would have orbited a red dwarf star called LHS 2520, says Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium in New York City. As reported by SPACE.com senior writer Mike Wall, the star is 27.1 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Corvus, also known as ‘The Crow’, says Dr. Tyson. The star is cooler and smaller than our sun. On Screen: Actor Bryan Singer in 'Superman Returns.' Star struck: Astronomer Neil deGrasse Tyson helped DC Comics, home of the Superman comics, find a plausible star to be the host of the superhero's home planet, Krypton. Star vision: A hypothetical terrestrial planet and moon orbiting the red dwarf star AU Microscopii. The coordinates of LHS 2520 are: . Right Ascension: 12 hours, 10 minutes, 5.77 seconds . Declination: -15 degrees, 4 minutes, 17.9 seconds . Proper Motion: 0.76 arcseconds per year, along 172.94 degrees from due north . ‘This is a major milestone in the Superman mythos that gives our super hero a place in the universe,’ DC Entertainment co-publisher Dan DiDio said in a company statement. ‘Having Neil deGrasse Tyson in the book was one thing, but by applying real-world science to this story he has forever changed Superman’s place in history,’ he said. ‘Now fans will be able to look up at the night’s sky and say, “That’s where Superman was born.”’ The man: Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium in New York City. The planetary details will be encompassed in a new Superman book titled, ‘Star Light, Star Bright,’ which comes out on Wednesday. Dr. Tyson, who has a history of applying science to entertainment, will appear in the comic, aiding Superman on his adventure. In real life, Dr. Tyson made headlines in April after getting film director, James Cameron, to alter the night’s sky as seen in The Titanic due to inaccuracies.

Dealing with Britain’s debts must not be done solely through attacks on public pending and welfare, the Lib Dems said today. In a swipe at the Tories, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said ‘there is such a thing as society’ as he warned the wealthiest must be made to pay their fair share. He also used a speech to the Lib Dem conference in York to dismiss ‘feeble’ Tory attempts to claim the income tax cut as their own policy, and signalled people who earn up to £12,500 should pay no income tax at all. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander warned the Tories against balancing the books through spending cuts alone . Mr Alexander told the Lib Dem spring conference in York that tax rises on the rich were also needed . Tory Chancellor George Osborne has said that another £25billion must be found after the election, which he wants to raise from cuts to housing benefit for young people and removing council houses from wealthy tenants. But Mr Alexander rejected the idea, insisting tax rises on the richest should also be used to balance the books. He told delegates: ‘There is still much to do in this Parliament and the next to pay down the deficit and secure the recovery. This must be done fairly. ‘And here’s where I have news for those on the right  – there is such a thing as society. ‘We cannot and will not rely only on cutting public spending and targeting welfare to finish the job. ‘That’s why we are committed to ensuring that the wealthiest pay their fair share. Mr Alexander warned the Tories 'there is such a thing as society' ‘We will find a way forward that underpins a stronger economy and delivers a fairer society.’ He warned that even with forecasts projecting the government running a surplus by 2018, ‘we will still have work to do to get our national debt burden down to safe levels’. ‘It would not be fair to leave that to our children,’ he added. ‘But we Liberal Democrats will also ensure that the state has the resources to fund the public services and infrastructure investment that our country needs. ‘And we will insist that the wealthiest make a proper contribution.’ Mr Alexander also made clear that raising the personal income tax allowance to £12,500 will be a key Liberal Democrat demand in any coalition talks after the 2015 election. In 2010 the Lib Dems promised to increase the threshold to £10,000, which it will reach in April this year. The Budget next month is expected to include a further £500 rise, which will come into effect next week, weeks before the general election. Mr Alexander said: ‘We will fight the next election with our own ideas, our own policies, our own values - no one else's. ‘And I can tell you that a top priority in any negotiation will be our aspiration to raise the personal allowance dramatically again in the next Parliament. ‘To raise it to £12,500... That would be a further tax cut for working people of £500. ‘At our first fiscal event in the next Parliament, we would deliver another tax cut of at least £100. ‘A two term Lib Dem government would then be delivering a tax cut for working people of £1200 - that's £100 a month.’ Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg applauds Mr Alexander's speech in the conference hall of the York Barbican . He claimed the rise in the tax allowance was ‘forced through’ in the face of opposition from the Tory wing of the coalition., but the Conservatives were now trying to take the credit for the policy. ‘We have had to fight for this at every Budget and at every Autumn Statement since 2010. ‘And what a fight it has been. It started in those election debates when the Conservatives said 'we cannot afford it'. ‘In 2010 the Conservatives wanted inheritance tax cuts for millionaires, we fought for and delivered tax cuts for working people. ‘In 2011 the Conservatives wanted 'shares for rights', we fought for and delivered tax cuts for working people. ‘In 2013 the Conservatives wanted a tax break for married couples that excluded millions of families, we fought for and delivered - you guessed it - more tax cuts for working people. ‘Now, belatedly, some Tories are lamely trying to claim credit. ‘Don't get me wrong, it must be hard to be a Tory in a Treasury delivering so much Lib Dem policy, so it's no surprise if some of them have gone native.’","Danny Alexander dismisses Tory plan to slash £25billion in spending .

Facebook's stock has fallen below $30 for the first time since its much-awaited public debut this month. The stock continued its noted decrease, finishing the day on Tuesday at $28.84. The public launch of Facebook Inc. began . trading publicly on May 18, just one day before the company's founder . Mark Zuckerberg wed his longtime girlfriend Priscilla Chan, was one of . the most anticipated stock offerings in history. Zucked: Mark Zuckerberg saved $174 million by cashing out tens of millions of shares of Facebook stock early Friday when the price was above $38 a share . In spite of the troubles on the market, Mr Zuckerberg and Ms Chan went ahead with their honeymoon plans and are on holiday in Italy at present. The couple met while both students at Harvard University, which is when Mr Zuckerberg launched the program out of his dorm room. In the past eight years, the site has grown into a worldwide network of almost a billion people, was supposed to offer proof that social media is a viable business and more than a passing fad. Trouble ahead: Ms Sandberg and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg rings the Nasdaq's opening bell for the company's initial public offering . Facebook's initial public offering of stock priced at $38 and raised $16billion for Facebook and some of its early investors. It had valued the company at $104billion - more than Amazon.com Inc., at $98billion, at the time. The couple have travelled to the picturesque part of Southern Italy - a part of the country so beautiful it has been declared a World Heritage Site - from Rome, where they have spent the past few days sight-seeing. Yesterday the newlyweds were spotted brushing up on some Italian architecture as they toured the Sistine Chapel. A fellow tourist snapped the Facebook CEO as he wandered around the chapel in the Vatican with a priest and tour guide, occasionally placing an affectionate hand on his new bride's back. Zuckerberg and his wife listened intently to a guide explaining the marvels of the stunning 500-year-old paintings that adorn the walls and ceilings. Eschewing glitzy restaurants and stiff luxury dining, the two opted for a meal at a Kosher restaurant called Nonna Betta in Rome's Jewish Ghetto where they enjoyed a simple Italian meal of fried pumpkin flowers and ravioli in an artichoke sauce. Their bill, which was immediately posted online, revealed that the two sipped tea and water, and paid just 32 euros for their feast - a mere drop in the ocean of Zuckerberg's fortune. But the stock's public debut was marred by technical glitches at the Nasdaq Stock Market that delayed trading. And the company, along with the investment banks that led the IPO, is the subject of at least two shareholder lawsuits. They . allege that analysts at the large underwriting investment banks cut . their second-quarter and full-year forecasts for Facebook just before . the IPO and told only a handful of clients. Amid a flurry of lawsuits over . Facebook's IPO, Morgan Stanley announced in a memo on Wednesday that it . is reviewing Facebook trades and would adjust prices for some retail . customers who overpaid. The IPO mishaps have sparked numerous . lawsuits against Morgan Stanley, the Nasdaq stock exchange and Facebook . itself by shareholders who claimed they hid the social networking . company's weakened growth forecasts just before it went public. The allegations raised questions about whether top investors profited at the expense of smaller buyers. The insider spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Facebook's much-anticipated IPO was delayed by a half-hour on Friday because of technical glitches on the Nasdaq. After pricing at $38, Facebook's stock initially closed up 23 cents on Friday and has been down since. In a sign of how feeling is changing . against Facebook, some commentators have begun comparing its activities . to the most reckless behaviour of Wall Street banks.

ff7ab87aff90f04fee5626c7f5f4fd3ede224865,"By . John Stevens, Political Reporter . An MP who was suspended from the Liberal Democrats over claims he sexually harassed a vulnerable constituent publicly apologised to her yesterday. Mike Hancock admitted he had ‘crossed the line’ and had an ‘inappropriate and unprofessional’ relationship with the woman after she asked him for help with noisy neighbours. But in an extraordinary development last night, it emerged he will not face an investigation by the parliamentary sleaze watchdog – meaning he could cling on as an independent MP until next year’s election. Portsmouth South MP, Mike Hancock leaves his home in Fareham, Hampshire admitted that his relationship with a vulnerable constituent had 'crossed a line' The 68-year-old, who represents Portsmouth South, had repeatedly denied the allegations by the single mother, known only as ‘Annie’ or ‘AH’, during her four-year fight to obtain an apology. But yesterday as part of a High Court settlement he apologised unreservedly for any distress. The case is a major embarrassment for Nick Clegg, who was accused of turning a blind eye to the claims, and follows a string of sex scandals to engulf the Lib Dems. In a statement read at the High Court yesterday, Mr Hancock said: ‘In October 2009 you first came to me as a constituent to seek my assistance as your MP and councillor. The former Lib Dem faces an internal party investigation into his behaviour . Subsequently and over several months I came to your home on several occasions, sometimes unannounced and conducted a friendship that was inappropriate and unprofessional. ‘I understand that you felt degraded. I did not treat you with sufficient respect. I made you feel deeply uncomfortable and discriminated against and I crossed the line. As a political representative, there is a significant power differential with any constituent seeking help and particularly with your vulnerability of which I was aware. ‘You had a right to trust me. Everyone should feel safe and should be able to have confidence in their political representatives and I am sorry I made you feel otherwise. I have learnt from my mistakes and pledge not to act in the same way again.’ He added: ‘I also recognise that hurtful and untrue statements were made publicly about your motivation in bringing the claim. These statements sought to discredit and undermine you. ‘This should never have happened. I accept that you did not bring the claim for financial gain and any statements to the contrary were wrong.’ The 39-year-old woman had attempted to complain about Mr Hancock’s behaviour through the police, the office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, as well as the Liberal Democrat party and Portsmouth City Council, but her solicitor yesterday said she had been ‘blocked from achieving a remedy at each stage’. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she had contemplated suicide over the ‘disgusting’ way she had been treated by the Liberal Democrats. Yesterday she said: ‘I am pleased that there has finally been a resolution to what has been a long and hurtful ordeal for me. Since the incidents about which I complained happened back in 2010, my physical and mental health have suffered and I am grateful that I may now have some closure to this traumatic episode in the lives of both myself and my son.’ The woman first met Mr Hancock in October 2009 at his constituency office in Southsea, after seeking help to deal with noisy neighbours. A year later, he was arrested after she complained to a carer about his alleged sexual advances. He was never charged after police found there was no case to answer. ■ In 2011, a Russian woman accused of being a spy admitted having a four-year affair with Hancock while she worked as his researcher. Ekaterina Zatuliveter (right) revealed the relationship in court in 2011 as she successfully fought deportation after it was claimed she  targeted the MP as part of a ‘honeytrap’ operation. During her time working with Hancock, she even moved into his London flat. ■ Earlier that year, Hancock admitted having a ‘close and affectionate relationship’ with a 17-year-old girl. The pair met at his office when she inquired about undertaking work experience. ‘It was a very affectionate relationship – it was strong but not sexual,’ he said. ‘There was contact between us – a kiss and cuddle but no more than that.’ ■ In 2010 it was claimed that Hancock had helped another Russian woman, 25-year-old Ekaterina Paderina, to stay in Britain after she ran into visa problems in the Nineties. Miss Paderina’s ex-husband said the MP went out of his way to help the blonde after she paid several visits to his office. ■ Hancock was also accused of having two affairs with colleagues during the Eighties and Nineties. The marriage of Liz McCann (right), a Lib Dem councillor and a mother of three, broke up as a result of their relationship. ‘I had heard about his reputation for women which goes before him in the party,’ she said. Hancock was also said to have had a six-year affair with Daphne Sparshatt, his constituency secretary. She told a newspaper: ‘He’s no great looker, he’s not God’s gift to women, but he charms his way in.’ ■ There have also been allegations that Hancock had a relationship with Daniela Aura Dobre, 20, whom he met during an aid trip to a village near Bucharest in October 1990. She claimed: ‘We were very close. I miss him very much. He’s a kind and charming man. He came on many trips, first in October 1990, then Christmas that year, then in January, March and April or May. I saw him each time.’ In March 2011, the woman complained about Mr Hancock to senior Lib Dem officials at the party’s Westminster headquarters, but no action was taken against him. In a letter to Mr Clegg’s office in February last year, she said Mr  Hancock had exposed himself to her, made numerous unwanted sexual advances and forcibly kissed her, but he was still not disciplined. Last night she told the Mail: ‘Nick Clegg has been negligent. He should have acted sooner and taken notice of a woman in my position.’ The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards can examine financial wrongdoing but cannot investigate claims an MP has abused their position in other ways. It means Mr Hancock could keep his seat until the next election. Portsmouth City Council did ask Nigel Pascoe QC to investigate the allegations. But his report was never published and the Lib Dem-controlled council voted to keep it under wraps. In his conclusions, Mr Pascoe wrote: ‘Making full allowances for the disclosed mental history of AH, I have no doubt that she has provided before me compelling prima facie evidence of serious and unwelcome sexual behaviour carried out towards her by Mr Hancock.’ Mr Hancock was suspended from the Lib Dems in January after the case became public. The party yesterday said a disciplinary investigation will now be re-started.","Former Lib Dem Mike Hancock admitted he had 'crossed the line'

He refused to apologize during the court hearing in Provo, Utah, claiming that he was not responsible and that his wife committed suicide. 'I did not kill my wife… I can't say sorry for something I did not do. 'I won't say sorry. It's not my fault that she shot herself,' Truman said, according to sltrib.com, during a rambling half-hour speech. The 32-year-old said he would never give up fighting his murder conviction as it was a 'big injustice', adding that the evidence was circumstantial. Mrs Truman's family were in court to watch her husband sentenced but the victim's mother, Janet Wagner, opted to leave the room while the killer made his statement. His attorney Ron Yengich said in court that his client plans to appeal. Heidy Truman was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head at the couple's Orem, Utah home on September 30, 2012. Truman had claimed that his wife either committed suicide or was gunned down by a stranger  outside the home. During his trial, police officers testified that Truman's bizarre behavior following his wife's shooting raised suspicion. Heidy Truman, 25, was killed by a gunshot wound to the head at her Utah home in September 2012. Her husband was sentenced to life in prison for her murder on Monday . Defense attorney Ron Yengich comforts Conrad Truman during his sentencing where he was ordered to spend life in prison for his wife's murder . Truman had reported his wife's death during an emotional 911 call. 'There's so much blood. If they don't get here right now, she's gonna die,' he wailed in the call, which was played at his preliminary hearing in 2013. 'I don't know what happened. I really don't know what happened, I swear to God. She was in the shower, she came out of the shower and I heard a pop, and there's blood, and she's in blood. Later, he shouted on the call: 'If you don't get here quick, my wife's life is on your head. My wife.' After officers arrived, they found the home in disarray, blood spatter throughout and Mrs Truman naked in the bathroom with a single bullet wound to her head. An investigation found she had been shot at close-range. A police officer also testified during the trial last year that when officers responded to the home after the 911 call, they found Mr Truman kissing her feet and saying he was sorry . Officer Art Lopez told the court last October that Truman was threatening to kill the officers if they didn't save his wife. Officers added that Truman had allowed the couple's dogs to walk through evidence and he went to the bathroom without a police officer, the court heard. Prosecutors said that Truman killed his wife so he could collect her $878,000 life-insurance policy. Before the shooting, Truman and his wife of three years had been watching TV show Dexter and drinking whiskey. Truman's defense team argued that the reason he gave confused accounts of what had happened was because he was drunk and had just found his wife shot dead. However after giving conflicting accounts, officers later tried to question Truman - but he failed to return their phone calls and refused to speak to them at his workplace. Following an investigation into the death, he was eventually arrested during a traffic stop in July 2013, nearly a year after his wife died. Mrs Truman was found with a gunshot wound at close range at the couple's home in Orem, Utah in September 2012 after the couple had been drinking and watching TV .","Conrad Mark Truman, 32, was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of Heidy Truman, 25, in Provo, Utah on Monday .

But this shocking footage has been compiled by the U.S. State Department in a propaganda drive of its own to discourage would-be jihadists from joining the terror group. Its emergence comes as President Barack Obama prepares for a critical speech on Wednesday in which he intends to begin laying out his strategy for defeating the Muslim extremists. The video, which has been viewed more . than 500,000 times, was posted on YouTube with the title Welcome to the . 'Islamic State' land in a campaign called 'Think Again, Turn Away'. Scroll down for video . Social media warfare: The U.S. State Department has posted a chilling video online showing executions (above) and suicide bombings in a drive to discourage would-be jihadists from joining the Islamic State . Gruesome: The video compiles shocking images used in the Islamic State's own propaganda footage in recent weeks, including this one of prisoners being killed and crucified . Hard-hitting: The video, which has been viewed more than 500,000 times, was posted on YouTube as part of a campaign called 'Think Again, Turn Away' to dissuade U.S. citizens who may be thinking about joining ISIS . It starts with the phrase: 'Run. Do not walk to ISIS land' before showing a body being thrown off a cliff. Then, using macabre clips posted by IS in its own videos, it proceeds to show executions, crucifixions and suicide bombings - skills it says sympathizers can learn if they join the group. Many of the images are far too graphic to show. It ends with the sarcastic sign off: 'Travel is inexpensive because you won't need a return ticket!' followed by more images of blood-covered bodies slumped on the ground. Shocking: The video also contains security footage of a suicide bomber (top left) blowing up a mosque . The campaign, directed at Muslims in the United States, aims to counter the Islamic State's powerful social media machine which has been used to recruit fighters from across the world . Mocking tone: The video lists so-called 'useful skills' like blowing up mosques which ISIS sympathisers can learn if they join the group . The campaign, directed at Muslims in the United States, aims to counter the Islamic State's powerful social media machine which has been used to recruit fighters from across the world with messages and videos on YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Alberto Fernandez, co-ordinator of the State Department's Center for Strategic Counter-terrorism Communications, which runs the program, has called it ‘participating in the marketplace of ideas', according to CNN. The State Department has also set up a series of anti-ISIS accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr as part of a larger social media campaign against the group’s extremism. 'Our mission is to expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda', the State Department said on the campaign's Facebook page. As . concerns grow over the allure of ISIS to some young men, it’s hoped that . the video will steer them away from travelling overseas. At present, more than 100 U.S. citizens have travelled overseas to join the jihadist group. The video ends with the sarcastic sign off: 'Travel is inexpensive because you won't need a return ticket!' In an escalation of the offensive against IS, President Obama is expected to lay his strategy when he meets with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House tomorrow. He will then deliver a speech on Wednesday on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Lawmakers said in advance that they would like the president to give specifics. The president should target command and control centers and oil refineries controlled by insurgents within Syria, suggested Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who sits on both the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees. Rubio, claiming that Obama has committed 'presidential malpractice in his foreign policy,' said he is eager to hear directly what Obama 'should have said months, weeks ago.' 'First, clearly explain to the American people what our national security interests are in the region' and spell out the risk that Islamic State militants pose 'for us, short-term and long-term, and why they matter,' Rubio told CBS' 'Face the Nation.' 'Clearly, he's put together a coalition of the willing - we have heard that before - to tackle this problem,' said House Intelligence Republican Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told CNN. 'That's good.' Sickening: The US State Department video is intended to shock would-be jihadists from wanting to join IS . The State Department has also set up a series of anti-ISIS accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr as part of a larger social media campaign against the group's extremism . Speaking Monday on MSNBC, Rogers said, 'I think in Congress we need to expose all members to the level of threat that those of us on the national security committees see every day.' He said Washington political leaders should not give the Islamic militants the 'time and space' to grow into a more formidable force, which he said happened with the al-Qaida terrorist network. Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on the same CNN program that Obama needs to spell out both the diplomatic and military components of his strategy. 'Time's a-wasting, because we have now said that we're going to go on the offensive. And it's time for America to project power and strength,' Feinstein said. Obama sparked criticism, most of it from Republicans, for his remark last week that 'we don't have a strategy yet' for confronting Islamic extremists gaining both land and followers in the Middle East. His upcoming sessions with lawmakers and the speech to the nation are clearly an attempt to try to show he now has an evolving strategy in place. Summit: . US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel (left) with President Barack Obama and . UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the NATO summit in Wales last week . 'The next phase is now to start going on some offense,' Obama said in an interview with NBC's 'Meet the Press.' 'But . this is not going to be an announcement about U.S. ground troops,' he . added in the session taped Saturday and broadcast Sunday. The operations will be 'similar to the kinds of counterterrorism campaigns' the U.S. has waged in the past, Obama said. 'In Syria, the boots on the ground have to be Syrian.' At the recent NATO summit in Wales, the U.S. and nine allies agreed to take on the militants because of the threat they pose to member countries. In addition to laying claim to territory, the militants have targeted religious and ethnic minority groups and threatened U.S. personnel and interests in the region. At Obama's direction, the U.S. military has conducted more than 130 airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq in the past month. In retaliation, the group recently beheaded two American journalists it had been holding hostage in Syria, where the organisation also operates. But the president has repeated his opposition to sending in U.S. ground troops to engage in direct combat with the militants, who have laid claim to large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria. Lawmakers have pressed Obama, so far unsuccessfully, to expand the airstrikes further.","WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT .

Nicholas Long stole £450 from Sainsbury's by scanning in his groceries as loose onions at the self-service checkout . As a fraudster with 20 super- market scams under his belt, Nicholas Long should have known his onions. But onions were precisely where the former international hockey player came unstuck. Long, 25, stole from Sainsbury’s 20 times in three months by fooling the self-service scanner into thinking more expensive items were onions. The debt-ridden City recruitment consultant was caught by a security guard who spotted that every item of his grocery shopping was being scanned as  loose onions. Long managed to save £450 using the ruse, which his own lawyer admitted to a court was ‘stupid’. He would take an item such as an avocado, which costs more by weight than loose onions, then place it on the scales of the scanner and declare it as the cheaper vegetable. The former under-19 hockey international dreamed up the scheme when he feared losing his job and his then-girlfriend became pregnant, the Old Bailey heard. He was also saddled with a £10,000 loan he had taken out on his father’s behalf. But his father’s firm failed soon after, leaving Long with the debt. Long was caught trying to get away cheaply with a £22 shop on August 7. He confessed to having repeatedly conned the same Central London store, which didn’t even sell loose onions, but had them on their standardised scanners. ‘It is a straightforward allegation that he went to Sainsbury’s and was seen scanning various items in at the self-service checkout’, said prosecutor Denise Murrin. Long used the scam 20 times in three months but was eventually caught by a security guard (file picture) ‘All items were being scanned as . loose onions, but the store does not sell loose onions. It was an . inexpensive way of doing his shopping.’ Long had previous convictions . for shoplifting, having taken a coat from John Lewis in 2010 and . attempted to pass off a bottle of champagne as bleach using the same . scam in 2011. He also stole a mobile phone from a handbag at a party in 2012. Angus Mathieson, defending, said Long . was driven by mounting debts and the fear of losing his job.  ‘It was a . stupid thing he has  done’, he said. ‘He was not getting a stupid . amount, not substituting champagne or anything like that, but just . getting an avocado and claiming it was an onion. ‘He had a good job at the time, but . committed an offence as he felt his job was under threat and he was . imminently likely to be made redundant. His girlfriend had become . pregnant and he was worried about money, because he had debts. ‘Part of the debts had arisen because . he had taken a bank loan out for his father, who needed money to help . his business along. He took out a £10,000 loan, but his father’s . business failed and he was saddled with the debt.’ Mr Mathieson said Long was not a . ‘manipulating and calculating thief’, and said he used his hockey . experience by voluntarily training young players at weekends. Long was given 180 hours community service after admitting fraud by false representation at the Old Bailey . But Judge Paul Worsley QC said Long . was a ‘persistent thief’ and warned him he was on the edge of a prison . sentence. He added: ‘Stealing from a supermarket is always serious. It . pushes up the cost of goods for honest members of the public who have to . pay to cover the cost of those goods lost through dishonesty. ‘You are an otherwise respectable . young man who achieved international honours in hockey, so it is sad to . see you before the courts.  But if you persist in taking other people’s . property, you will go to prison.’ Long, of Chatham, Kent, admitted a . single count of fraud by false representation. He was given 180 hours’ community service and ordered to pay £250 costs.","Debt-ridden Nicholas Long, 25, used the scam 20 times in three months .

Photography was the furthest thing from Holly Spring's mind when daughter Violet was struck down with a debilitating bowel condition that almost cost her her life. Born with just one hand, her right, the new born 'went blue in the face' following surgical complications to correct a bowel condition known as Hirschprung's disease. Clinging to life in an Auckland Hospital, it was at that this point her New Zealand mother realised just how incredibly important her daughter's fragile life was to her, so she began documenting it using digital photography. Holly Spring wanted to show that her daughter could live a normal childhood through her work . Using a beach backdrop, a photo of a giraffe at a zoo and a photo of her daughter Holly Spring created this digital image . Violet Spring, at just four, has had to endure a difficult upbringing due to her poor health . 'Ive always been an artist, I'm in a rock band, but digital photography didn't come until after that close call,' the 38-year-old award winning photographer said. Mrs Spring, whose daughter still lives with the debilitating condition despite surgery to remove a third of her bowel, does not know when Violet could relapse again and takes every day in her stride. 'At any time she might need more surgery or she could get a blockage...you just never know.' Combined with an inability to use her left arm, Mrs Spring wanted to show through her work that the person she describes as her 'muse' and her 'heart’ was capable of living a normal, everyday childhood. She said Violet was the reason she decided to dedicate a life to her new career, which she is now an award winner after claiming the 2014 New Zealand Portrait Creative Photographer of the Year. 'I realised I would have had no decent quality memories of her after that (possible death). 'So my husband bought me a camera, a  DSLR, and from that point on I started shooting her growing, and going from strength to strength.' Many of Holly Spring's images show her daughter's left arm with the focal point centred on her right hand . 'growing from strength to strength:' Holly has been teaching her daughter to utilise her disability for good . Holly and Violet 'role play' certain scenes to capture the best image that brings out the four-year-old's exuberant personality . Holly was awarded the NZ Portrait Creative Photographer of the Year for 10 images she submitted of her daughter . Experimenting with different digital layers, colours and other new found skills she began role playing different scenarios with her four-year-old. 'I get her to look at things around her, the wondrous things that she sees and how she interacts with them.' One of her favourite images - a shot of her daughter looking up at a Giraffe - was part of a compilation of 10 images that earned her her national photography award. Using three individual photographs, Mrs Spring layered each of the images on top of another to create the stunning affect of her daughter playing with the long-necked animal. On holiday, she shot an image of a stunning beach landscape, one of her daughter playing in the street and another of a giraffe at a zoo. She said the most important subject matter in each of her images is her daughter.

Leesa Wenman, 32, has been found guilty of arson after she started two fires in the bedroom of her home in Harlow causing £13,000 of damage. The local council moved her to the flat in the Essex town in late July last year but within two weeks she was having rows with neighbours. Chelmsford Crown Court heard how the 32-year-old was arrested on August 6 after her flat was torched. The court heard how neighbours called 999 when they spotted plumes of smoke coming out of Wenman's flat window. It took firefighters 30 minutes to control the blaze, which caused £13,000-worth of damage. Carolyn Gardiner, prosecuting, told the court that Wenman was 'not happy' with her new home. The court heard she started the fire shortly after she asked to borrow a cigarette lighter from a neighbour and then climbed out of a window and went to a friend's house. She told the court: 'Neighbours smelled smoke, it smelled like plastic was burning. They realised Wenman's flat was on fire. 'This defendant had motive - she had fallen out with her neighbours.' The fire service then had to break in to the flat and put out the blaze. Neighbour Kerry Roche told the court that Wenman had told her she hated living in the new house 'within a week' of moving in, saying she told her she 'did not get on with the neighbours'. Dangerous: Smoke pours from the windows of the block of flats that Wenman set fire to last year. She denied arson but was found guilty . The jury heard how two fires were started in the bedroom, with investigators finding burn marks on the floorboards and skirting board.

Police in Roswell, Georgia, say Bobbi Kristina Brown was driving a Jeep Liberty on January 27 when she lost control, crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with another vehicle. A passenger in the Jeep and the other car's driver were taken to the hospital. Four days later, on January 31, Brown was found unresponsive in her bathtub, and her family said she's been 'fighting for her life' since. Lost control of car: Bobbi Kristina Brown was driving a Jeep Liberty on January 27 when she lost control, crossed into oncoming traffic and collided with another vehicle. She was found unresponsive on January 31. The 21-year-old is seen here in an undated selfie . Support: On Thursday, Bobbi Kristina's grandmother Cissy Houston was seen at Emory University Hospital, where the 21-year-old woman remains in a coma . By her side: Cissy Houston walks out of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, on Thursday . Visiting: Bobbi Kristina's father Bobby Brown visits his daughter on Thursday . Records also show that Brown's partner, Nick Gordon, called police in July 2013 saying she had fallen and was unresponsive. The officer wrote at the time that she was disoriented and went to the hospital. The news of the car crash and the domestic call come after Bobbi Kristina's aunt said she believes Nick Gordon will '110 per cent' be charged with a crime related to Bobbi Kristina's injuries. Leolah Brown, Bobby Brown's sister, said she thinks Brown was involved with Bobbi Kristina being found face-down in a bathtub at the couple's  townhouse over a week ago. No one has been charged in the incident or named as a suspect, and Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations. Bobbi Kristina has been on a ventilator in hospital since she was found, but Leolah Brown insisted she is 'doing good' and has even opened her eyes. Speaking out: Speaking to Fox News, Leolah Brown, Bobbi Kristina's aunt, has said she believes the young woman's boyfriend, Nick Gordon, should be charged in relation to her injuries . 'Fighting for life': Bobbi Kristina, who has been in a medically-induced coma for the last 12 days, was involved in a car crash just four days before she was rushed to hospital unresponsive . 'I saw this coming,' she told Fox 5 Atlanta. 'I told her not to trust anyone.' Gordon was taken in by Houston as a child and brought up as Bobbi Kristina's brother - but after Houston's death, they started a romantic relationship and last year, they claimed they had married. In the Fox interview, Leolah said she does not think Gordon has been a good influence on her niece. 'I have my reasons,' she said, without going into further detail. 'There are a lot of family reasons that have that same reason.' She went on: 'I believe Nick Gordon will be charged with this... I hope that he will be charged with this as well. Soon. I really do.' She added that she had lived with Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown and had helped them look after Bobbi Kristina, but never saw Gordon around the house. 'Signs of improvement': She said that Bobbi Kristina, pictured with Gordon, has opened her eyes and appears to be improving. Gordon has not responded to the family's accusations about his part in the incident . Scene: Gordon and a friend discovered Bobbi Kristina in the bathtub at their home in the neighborhood of Roswell, Georgia, pictured, on January 31. She has been in a medically-induced coma ever since . She also reiterated her brother's statement that the young couple are not married, despite their claims on social media last year, and hinted that they had been through some trouble. 'This is the man Krissi loved but she was a young girl,' she said. 'We stay.' Leolah also dismissed the idea that Bobbi Kristina would have hurt herself. 'Krissi would never do anything to herself,' she said. 'She loved life too much. She had too much going on. She had too much ahead of her.' As for her niece's current condition, she rubbished reports that Bobbi Kristina was brain dead. 'It's been very, very painful for everybody. Mainly Bobby, because that's his baby,' she said of her brother, Bobby Brown. But she added that they remain hopeful, especially because she has given them 'signs' that she'll recover, such as opening her eyes, she said. There is also no truth to the idea that Bobbi Kristina would be removed from life support today - the same day her mother died three years ago - she said. 'No,' she said, adding: 'Bobby's calling the shots.' The family has been at Bobbi Kristina's bedside in Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where she remains in a medically-induced coma after being found submerged in bathwater. On the scene: Max Lomas, seen in an old mug shot, was the one who found Bobbi Kristina in the bath . No one has been charged or named as a suspect in the January incident. Gordon has not commented publicly about his girlfriend's condition and has not responded to the family's accusations. Earlier this week, RadarOnline reported that bruises were found on Bobbi Kristina's body. Gordon told a friend that he caused them while performing CPR. It has also emerged that one of their neighbors reported a domestic dispute at her address the week before she was found, according to a 911 call made by her security guard on January 23. The caller told a 911 dispatcher that one of the neighbors had reported a fight at the address. They said they saw people 'hitting each other and swinging' outside the three bedroom townhouse. He did not give descriptions of how many people were fighting or who they were . The ongoing investigation and limited details being provided in Miss Brown's case have fueled speculation about her condition and the circumstances that led to her hospitalization. 'We continue to request privacy in this matter,' Bobby Brown said in a statement released through his lawyer, Christopher Brown. 'We thank everyone that supported the vigil for Bobbi Kristina. God is hearing our prayers.'","Car crash in Roswell, Georgia, was on January 27, new police reports show .

Fewer windows - instead of 'stacks' of windows, as in previous versions, the OS is built around clean 'tiles' that deliver information to the home screen. Free versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint - Windows 8 will offer Office free to tablet users. Business-friendly tablets - Windows 8 will work smoothly with Microsoft Exchange email systems, so could be highly popular with business. Apps shared with phones - apps in Windows 8 will be built to work smoothly with phones (such as Nokia's) running Microsoft's Windows Phone OS. Easier passwords - users will be able to unlock PCs with a PIN, or by circling details in a picture. No Start button - instead, users will access a menu from a 'hot corner' in the bottom left of the screen. The version on test is a 'consumer preview' so will be tweaked and polished before release, so reviewers were cautious about making judgements. Wired said, 'Your desktop is dead. The next few years of computing are going to be very interesting to watch unfold. But one thing's for sure: Microsoft is at least one step ahead of Apple in putting the desktop interface to rest.' Tech site Mashable was impressed, but overwhelmed by the sheer number of ways to control the new software, 'In the end, Microsoft isn’t just asking you to get used to a different interface for Windows. It’s asking you to get used to multiple  within the same OS. I’m not sure how many people have the patience for that. Still, Metro is gorgeous enough to keep me looking forward to Windows 8′s final act.' Boy Genius Report was more effusive, 'We are now entering the post-post-PC era, and its focus is the PC. A new, smarter, more versatile PC. This is the future of computing.

They are the little darlings who look awfully cute in a photo, or when curled up asleep in a cot – but a lot less appealing at 30,000ft, crying loudly in the seat right next to you. And according to a new survey, almost . seven in ten Britons dislike flying with babies so much that they would . like to see child-free areas introduced on planes. Oh lord, please not next to me: Almost seven in ten Britons would like to see child-free zones on aircraft . Almost one in four British travellers – 39 per cent – believes that no-kid-zones should be installed as compulsory compartments on long-haul flights where people want to sleep. And nearly a third – 30 per cent – would go further and bring in such silent spaces on all flights, long- and short-haul, to ensure stress-free travels for non-parenting passengers. The survey was conducted by bookings website LateDeals.co.uk, with 1,108 UK consumers questioned as to what they hate most about air travel. And our dislike of noisy children and babies on planes runs deep, it seems. More than a third of us – 35 per cent – would pay extra to travel on a childless service. Long-haul passengers would be prepared to cough up an additional £63 to the cost of a return ticket if it meant adults only on board. And on short-haul flights, an extra £28 on the price of a return fare would be deemed good value if it guaranteed an absence of toddlers having tantrums in the middle of the economy-class aisle. Imperfect passengers: Babies on planes are the pet peeve of 43 per cent of British travellers - although passengers who invade your personal space on board are barely more popular, criticised by 31 per cent of us . However, screaming infants are not the only source of frustration for British travellers. In fact, according to the research, a . bawling baby ranks as only the fourth most irritating category of . nightmare airline passenger. 1. Drunk and rowdy travellers: 58%2. People with bad hygiene: 48%3. Seat-kicking passengers: 47%4. Crying babies: 43%5. Lack of legroom: 41%6. Overweight passengers/passengers who invade personal space: 31%7. People who hog the arm-rest: 14%8. Poor quality food: 12%9. Snoring passengers: 10%10. Rude cabin crew: 9%11. Unallocated seating: 8%12. Not enough refreshments: 7%13. Running out of meal options: 7%14. Cabin temperature: 5% . Survey conducted by LateDeals.co.uk. 1,108 British consumers were questioned, and asked to pick three options from the list as pet peeves . Asked ‘Which of the following are the most annoying on a long flight?’, well over half of respondents – 58 per cent – selected ‘drunk and rowdy travellers’ as their pet peeve. People with ‘bad personal hygiene’ and travellers who kick the back of the seat in front were also near the top of the list, causing anger to 48 and 47 per cent of us respectively. Overweight flyers who invade other people’s space were the fifth most disliked passenger, flagged as a cause of exasperation by 31 per cent of respondees. Crying babies came in at fourth on the list, a bête noire for 43 per cent of those surveyed. ‘If you run into a screaming baby – or a noisy, hyperactive toddler and its exasperated parents – on a train, you can just move carriages,’ says Kay Dixon of LateDeals.co.uk. ‘The same does not apply to a flight. ‘If you are sitting next to a family with kids that can’t settle down, there is nowhere to go. ‘While most people are sympathetic towards parents with young children, many people simply don’t want so sit next to them – which is why the majority would like to see child-free zones on planes, and more than a third even want child-free planes.’ Other causes of aggravation revealed in the survey included people who hog the armrest between seats (nominated by 14 per cent of those questioned), people who snore (10 per cent) and rude cabin crew (nine per cent).","The majority of British travellers wish to see child-free areas on aircraft .

ff7ed1724f492b465091225c79001d8bed45733a,"(CNN) -- Hopes soared recently when the Nigerian government said it had reached a deal with the terrorist group Boko Haram to free more than 200 girls and young women still missing after a mass abduction in April. But with each passing day, it looks less and less likely that the girls will be freed. In fact, Boko Haram has kidnapped numerous other young people in at least two incidents that have happened since the Nigerian government reported a deal. Boko Haram kidnaps 30 in northeast Nigeria . What's going on? Who and what is Boko Haram? The name ""Boko Haram"" translates to ""Western education is sin"" in the local Hausa language. The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. The group was founded 12 years ago by charismatic cleric Mohammed Yusuf. Police killed him in 2009 in an incident captured on video and posted to the Internet. Boko Haram is now led by Abubakar Shekau. In recent years, its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the Nigerian government. The militant group has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. What was agreed upon in the ceasefire deal? Nigerian officials said on October 16 that President Goodluck Jonathan's government had reached a ceasefire agreement with Boko Haram after a month of negotiations. But officials provided few details about the release. Doyin Okupe, a government spokesman, did not specify when the girls would be freed. He said not all would be let go at once, but a ""significant number"" would be released soon. The Nigerian government had also consented to some demands by Boko Haram, but Okupe declined to provide details. Boko Haram has remained silent on the deal the government said it signed with the group in neighboring Chad last week. Nigerian officials have emphasized there is no set time line for release of the girls, which likely would happen on a piecemeal basis instead of all at once. So is there actually a deal? David Cook, who studies jihad, wrote on October 18 that he had doubts about a deal going through. ""It remains to be seen whether this truce will actually materialize, whether it is merely an election ploy for Nigeria's embattled President, Goodluck Jonathan, and most crucially whether it will bring about the release of numerous captives taken by Boko Haram during the past year,"" he wrote in an analysis for CNN. ""While Boko Haram has suffered some reverses during the recent past, there is no indication that the group has suffered any mortal damage. The most plausible interpretation of the truce is that it is a bought one (probably in tandem with the Cameroonian release of captives), and that Boko Haram is merely using it (assuming that it holds to the truce at all) as a respite in order to regroup."" In an article written for CNN the day after Nigeria announced the ceasefire, Brookings' Richard Joseph wrote: ""This is a case when we will actually need to see the girls emerging from their six-month confinement before we can truly believe."" What has Boko Haram done since Nigeria announced the truce? Boko Haram gunmen kidnapped at least 30 boys and girls from a village in northeast Nigeria during the weekend. Last week Boko Haram militia kidnapped 60 women and girls in two Christian villages in neighboring Adamawa state, according to residents and community leaders. The heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about $9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted Saturday, suggesting that they would be taken as sex slaves, residents told CNN. Then on Friday and Saturday, heavily armed Boko Haram gunmen invaded the town of Mafa in Borno state and seized 30 boys and girls, local leaders said. ""They took them away to their base in the bush, and we believe they are going to use them as foot soldiers,"" Mafa local government chairman Shettima Maina said. Mallam Ashiekh Mustapha, the local chief of Mafa who confirmed the abductions, said the kidnappers also stole 300 cows from the farming community in the raid. The Nigerian government has said Boko Haram has denied involvement in the kidnappings, but the group has issued no public statement on the issue. Are Boko Haram and Nigeria's government really interested in peace? Richard Joseph argues that ""the campaign for the Nigerian presidency has effectively merged with the campaign to defeat Boko Haram."" ""If the government is successful in brokering a lasting ceasefire with Boko Haram and bringing home these girls, Goodluck Jonathan would undoubtedly get a significant boost in his reelection efforts."" In July last year, Professor of African History and Peace Studies at the University of Ibadan Isaac Olawale Albert wrote an opinion piece for CNN in which he argued that Boko Haram had no reason to pursue peace. ""Leader Abubakar Shekau and some of the group's other senior members have nothing to gain from any permanent peace -- especially as the international community has already cast them in the mold of former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As they await eventual capture, they will not mind causing more trouble,"" Albert said. Director of the Royal African Society Richard Dowden noted in May that President Jonathan had not commented on the schoolgirls' abduction for two weeks after the incident. The reason, Dowden argued, was that the problems of the northeast region did not matter to his government as there was no incentive to develop the region. ""It produces nothing and will not vote for President Jonathan,"" he wrote. Why did Boko Haram abduct the girls? Shehu Sani, a human rights activist in northern Nigeria who has previously been involved in mediating with Boko Haram, told CNN in May that the mass April abduction and other recent attacks were messages to the Nigerian government that the recent arrest of Boko Haram followers in Islamic schools will be avenged. In 2012, Shekau's wife and three children were reportedly taken into military custody. Sani said he believed Boko Haram targeted the girls to force concessions from the Nigerian government -- beginning perhaps with the release of Boko Haram followers from prisons. ""The fact Shekau said he would sell the girls and did not say he would kill them is a clear indication that negotiation is possible,"" he said. But at least some of them may be traded for ransom money. Boko Haram has begun trading hostages for cash -- most notably in the case of a French family kidnapped in northern Cameroon last year and reportedly freed for some $3 million. The international outrage sparked by the abduction also serves Shekau. ""It has put pressure on the government to reach out to him,"" Sani said . Has Boko Haram negotiated before? Shekau is not beyond negotiating with the Nigerian government, despite his apocalyptic rhetoric and frequent denials of President Goodluck Jonathan's legitimacy. According to the International Crisis Group, negotiations in Ivory Coast a year ago were on the verge of producing ""an apparent peace agreement that was to begin with a ceasefire."" Then Shekau was designated a terrorist by the U.S. State Department and abandoned the talks. What are the chances of the girls' safe return? Jacob Zenn, an expert on Boko Haram with the Jamestown Foundation, a Washington-based research and analysis firm, said in May that the mass kidnapping may have been part of an effort by Shekau to reinforce the loyalty of largely uneducated recruits by providing them with ""free servants or sex slaves."" ""Many will likely end up becoming mothers -- it's a real horror and over the next years we'll slowly hear the stories of girls few-by-few as they manage to make it out,"" Zenn told CNN. ""Boko Haram has likely split up or sold the girls into many small groups,"" and they can be used as human shields in the event of an attack, he said. However, if the ceasefire announcement is real, it would appear the girls are alive, leaving hope for the chance of their return.","Ceasefire between Nigeria and Boko Haram raised hopes for release of kidnapped girls .
Militants have continued their kidnappings even after the deal was reached .
Some experts doubt that the ceasefire will go through .

ff7f5ea3ccf189502a18dfdd8e23eac0109e6c25,"(CNN) -- Like a viper that slithers through the garden -- mostly unseen, menacing, dangerous -- a troubling trend is taking hold in this country, a movement to shake the foundations of what ""born in the USA"" means. Wendy Ruiz was born in Miami in 1992. She graduated from a Miami public high school in 2010 and applied to Florida International University, a four-year state college that required her to disclose her parents' federal immigration status. Ruiz was unable to provide this information, so she was denied admission. She then applied to Miami Dade College to complete a two-year degree. When her acceptance letter arrived, there was a catch: She would be required to pay the out-of-state tuition rate. How could this be possible when Wendy Ruiz had lived her entire life in Florida? As the law stands, all children born in the United States, including those to undocumented immigrants, are granted U.S. citizenship. There are approximately 4.5 million American children like Wendy Ruiz who are U.S. citizens by virtue of birthright, yet whose parents are undocumented for federal immigration purposes. These U.S. citizen children of undocumented parents are Americans. Many will join the military and help fight our wars to keep us safe. Most of them will someday work and pay Social Security taxes so our aging population can enjoy a comfortable retirement (perhaps even in Florida). Yet politicians seeking to brandish their nativist credentials will do almost anything to discriminate against these American children, whom they call ""anchor babies."" One of the most egregious examples of this blatant discrimination -- one such ""viper"" -- occurs in my home state. The Sunshine State is the only state that unambiguously denies in-state tuition to U.S. citizen children of undocumented immigrants. (Similar cases have arisen in other states, like Arizona, Colorado, California, New Jersey and Virginia.) This out-of-state classification not only denies these students the preferential treatment in the admissions process that residents usually receive, but it also affects the tuition they must pay as ""out of state"" students. The tuition difference is stunning. At Miami Dade College, the cost per year in the two-year associate degree programs is $2,532 for residents, compared to $9,047 for students classified as nonresidents. The cost per year in the four-year bachelor's degree program at FIU is $2,800 for residents, compared to $12,492 for nonresidents. The net effect is that these students either delay or entirely forgo a college education because they simply can't afford the higher tuition. This insidious policy excludes talented, qualified young adult citizens from pursuing higher education -- because their parents lack immigration documents. Such wrongheaded policy has not gone unnoticed. The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a federal class action lawsuit in the Southern District Court of Florida charging systemic discrimination. Last week, Judge K. Michael Moore found that Florida is violating the constitutional rights of American-born children of undocumented immigrants by requiring them to pay higher tuition rates than other students at state colleges. He said, ""It is the plaintiffs who, upon graduating from a post-secondary educational institution, receive their names on diplomas, and it is plaintiffs â€” not plaintiffs' parents, cousins, or siblings â€” who are entitled to the benefits conferred by such a degree."" Moore was appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and is known not only for his keen intellect but also for his commonsense jurisprudence. Nearly 20 years ago he offered me a clerkship to work with him upon graduation from Columbia Law School and he swore in my Panamanian father as an American citizen in a private ceremony in his office. In his decision last week, his common sense and practical justice was clear; preferential in-state tuition rates for all Florida residents are simply a wise investment in Florida's future. Columbia University professor Neeraj Kaushal examined the effect of in-state tuition on enrollment rates at universities in California, New York, Texas and Utah, and compared those rates to 46 other states. She concluded that favorable in-state tuition policies resulted in a 31% increase in college enrollment rates. Also, graduates of state colleges tend to remain in the Florida workforce, where they earn more, pay higher taxes, promote the educational attainment of their own children, vote more, depend less on welfare and live healthier lives. Florida college graduates will typically earn 66% more than high school graduates over their working lives. These higher earnings mean higher tax payments at the local, state and federal levels. A college graduate will likely pay up to 80% more in taxes each year than someone with no college degree. Even during periods of high unemployment, those with college degrees re-enter the labor market sooner. Florida clearly benefits from providing an affordable post-secondary education to all its own high school graduates, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The state's lawyers argued that ""by offering in-state tuition rates to the U.S. citizens of undocumented immigrants, the state would be forced to offer in-state tuition rates to all U.S. citizens."" But Moore said the state's claim was based on its ""flawed interpretation"" of the 1996 federal welfare reform law, because the Florida students who sued the state ""are not 'aliens' but rather U.S. citizens."" Local Florida communities benefit, too, from students with a post-secondary education, as the increased salaries of these graduates is predicted to create more than 250,000 jobs and add $33 billion to Florida's economy over their working lifetime if the state realizes its five goals by 2016. If Florida wins, the whole country wins, because education increases the productivity of the United States, and the net effect is a rise in the gross national product. When one of the most pressing issues of our time -- education -- is seen through the lens of the worldview of those who would call Wendy Ruiz an ""anchor baby,"" denying her what all U.S. citizens are entitled to, the terrible costs of such a vision become crystal clear. The snake in the garden has reared its head -- and fortunately, wisdom has prevailed in the form of Judge Moore's decision. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles P. Garcia.","Charles Garcia: A judge ruled that children of immigrants in Florida deserve in-state tuition .

ff8026dcd34883956c9efe916006375a34f55b7c,"Washington (CNN) -- A 5-year-old's birthday party with no cake and candles? Unheard of, except in politics. Monday marked the fifth anniversary of President Barack Obama's signing of the 2009 stimulus bill, the focus of a hyper-partisan debate over the first major legislation of his presidency. By most assessments, the $800-billion-plus spending and tax-relief program helped reverse job losses and restore economic growth, though not as fast or strong as originally predicted. Arguments based on political ideology persist over whether it helped or hurt the county in the long run. Obama and Democrats argue it was crucial to the recovery from what is now called the Great Recession, while Republicans who opposed the stimulus then still call it the wrong prescription. CNNMoney: States' unemployment rates . White House relatively silent on anniversary: For Monday's milestone, the White House took the somewhat muted approach of releasing a blog post by Jason Furman, the chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, who touted a new report on the benefits from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ""The economy has now grown for 11 straight quarters, and businesses have added 8.5 million jobs since early 2010,"" Furman's blog post said. ""While far more work remains to ensure that the economy provides opportunity for every American, there can be no question that President Obama's actions to date have laid the groundwork for stronger, more sustainable economic growth in the years ahead."" Vice President Joe Biden will mark the anniversary on Wednesday in Illinois, but otherwise, Furman's post and the final report on the stimulus by the council he heads accounted for the total administration commemoration on the Presidents Day holiday. No silence from the right: Republicans, meanwhile, kept up their consistent drumbeat of criticism. The Republican National Committee sent reporters a morning email headlined: ""The Stimulus That Wasn't: Five Years Later, It's Clear Obama's Stimulus Was A Waste Of Taxpayer Dollars."" ""If you recall five years ago, the notion was that if the government spent all this money -- that, by the way, was borrowed -- that somehow the economy would begin to grow and create jobs,"" GOP Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said in a video. ""Well, of course, it clearly failed."" The differing reactions continue a pattern that pre-dates congressional approval of the stimulus law in 2009 with almost zero Republican support. CNNMoney: Where's the debt ceiling now? Republicans 'set terms' for economic debates: To Peter Hamby, CNN Digital's national political reporter, the Obama administration has been weak in communicating economic accomplishments compared to Republicans, who he said ""really set the terms ... for these economic debates."" That was obvious on Monday. Along with the RNC and Rubio attacks, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and two other Senate GOP leaders -- John Cornyn of Texas and John Thune of South Dakota -- also launched broadsides. The Republican criticism is part of GOP strategy to frame this year's congressional elections as a referendum on Obama's presidency, with the party's conservative base relentlessly hammering Democrats over still-sluggish economic growth and the Obamacare health reforms. A Pew Research poll from 2012 showed Americans divided and uncertain on the stimulus issue, with 37% supporting it, 41% registering disapproval and nearly a quarter of respondents unsure. As usual, a wide partisan divide existed, with two-thirds of Democrats in support compared to only 12% of Republicans. CNNMoney: 3 problems Congress should stop asking the Fed to solve . White House says legislative goals reached: The White House report on the stimulus released Monday said the legislation along with subsequent legislation intended to boost job growth achieved their goal. ""Considerable evidence suggests the federal government's efforts to jump-start the economy were successful,"" it concluded, adding that the stimulus bill ""provided an important and timely boost to GDP in 2009 and 2010."" Obama calls for continued government investment in job creation, such as funding infrastructure projects to rebuild roads and bridges, as well as jobs training programs. Republicans say stimulus proves their point: Republicans say the legacy of the stimulus bill showed a big government approach doesn't work. ""Five years later, underemployment is still too high, the number of people that have dropped out of the workforce is astounding, unemployment remains stubbornly high and our economy isn't growing fast enough â€” proof that massive government spending, particularly debt spending, is not the solution to our economic growth problems,"" Rubio's video said. In response to the fresh GOP attacks, the left-leaning ThinkProgress.org website noted that Republicans who opposed the stimulus bill in 2009 were happy to receive its benefits in ensuing years, with some claiming credit for projects funded with stimulus money they had opposed. Government intervention in response to the recession began in the final months of the Bush administration that preceded Obama, with bailouts of the financial system and auto industry. Obama continued and built on that strategy with the stimulus bill and expanded auto bailout. The stimulus plan included almost $300 billion in tax relief as well as spending on various programs and initiatives including education, medical research, health care, infrastructure, local law enforcement, energy and job training. CNN's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","White House report says stimulus bill achieved its goal of reversing downturn .

He said: 'They started pelting the deceased with all those loose oranges, killing him on the spot.' Two men  have been arrested in South Africa after a man was pelted to death with oranges . However, he warned that an investigation was still underway and that some 'complicated' aspects of a case still had to be verified.

ff80d9afddebbd299149eef01c340093f343b18c,"New York (CNN) -- Northeast Florida State Attorney Angela Corey has made it clear that she alone will decide whether George Zimmerman will be charged in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's attorneys termed as ""courageous"" her decision not to present evidence to the grand jury that the original prosecutor, Norman Wolfinger, scheduled to convene on April 10. The Trayvon Martin family was also pleased that Corey would make the charging decision. But the question remains, will George Zimmerman be charged? Tuesday, in a bizarre development, George Zimmerman's attorneys, Hal Uhrig and Craig Sonner, during a news conference held in front of the Seminole County Courthouse, announced that they had withdrawn from his representation. They said they had lost contact with their client over the previous two days and revealed Zimmerman's unusual behavior -- including phone calls to Fox News host Sean Hannity and the special prosecutor, Corey. The attorneys also said that they are concerned with Zimmerman's emotional and physical well-being and even suggested that he may be suffering from PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). In short, they said that their client had gone rogue. Clients fire attorneys every day, for no reason or any reason. And attorneys withdraw from cases around the country daily. But it is rarely done so publicly and with so much information divulged about the inner workings of the lawyer-client relationship. Rogue clients that are potential defendants spook prosecutors. It can be a nightmare to try to locate and arrest a fleeing defendant. Remember Joran Van Der Sloot. Not surprisingly, within hours of the now-infamous withdrawal, Corey issued a statement saying she would be holding her own news conference within 72 hours ""to release new information regarding the Trayvon Martin shooting death investigation."" Many suspect that the announcement that Zimmerman had gone rogue forced the special prosecutor's hand. By all accounts though, Angela Corey is a seasoned career prosecutor who doesn't bend to public opinion or political pressure. During her 25 years as an assistant state attorney, Corey tried hundreds of cases, including more than 50 homicides. During her three-year-plus as state attorney of the 4th Judicial Circuit, Jacksonville's Duval County jail has seen an increase in the population, despite a drop in crime in the city. Some say this is a direct result of her aggressive prosecutorial bent. But her career hasn't been without controversy. Recently she came under intense fire for charging 12-year-old Cristian Fernandez as an adult in the killing of his 2-year-old brother, making Christian the youngest person in Florida ever to be charged as an adult. Corey, a devout Episcopalian, references her faith in discussing her cases, which some would say is a no-no for a prosecutor. In a written statement she provided in response to her detractors about the Fernandez case, Corey defended her decision to charge Fernandez as an adult by stating, ""We are blessed in the 4th Circuit to have a great working relationship with ... public defenders,"" and ""We asked for prayers for our two-year-old victim, David, and for Cristian Fernandez."" In discussing the investigation into the shooting death of Martin she said, ""What we are asking people to do is take a step back. Pray for Trayvon. Pray for his family. Listen to their words. I believe these are wonderful people who are asking for a peaceful approach to this case, while still demanding the answers they deserve. And I look forward to meeting with them to try to help them on this journey. Our victims always have a tough plight."" If she files charges against Zimmerman, it would be wise not to ""overcharge"" the case. Corey needs to be able to prove her case beyond a reasonable doubt. To prove manslaughter in Florida, Corey's team would have to prove that Zimmerman's acts caused Martin's death. Manslaughter would not be difficult to prove but for Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. Florida's law states that a person who is not engaged in an unlawful activity and who is attacked in any place where he or she has a right to be has no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force ... to prevent death or great bodily harm. So even if Zimmerman killed Martin, he was justified in doing so if he believed he was in danger of being killed himself or of suffering great bodily harm. It seems the Sanford Police certainly believed Zimmerman's claims. But there is an exception. If Zimmerman was the initial aggressor, he cannot avail himself of the protection of the ""stand your ground"" law. Former Florida State Rep. Dennis Baxley, the co-sponsor of the law, told me by phone that the law doesn't apply to Zimmerman if he pursued Martin and was the initial aggressor. And he is right. Florida's statute makes it clear that the justification is not available to a person who initially provokes the use of force against himself, unless such force is so great that the person reasonably believes that he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that he has exhausted every reasonable means to escape. And that is what this case ultimately boils down to -- who started the fight. And the answer to that question is far from clear. Martin left the home of his father's fiancee on February 26 to buy skittles and an ice tea. He was unarmed. Zimmerman left his home to go to Target and was carrying a concealed weapon for which he had a permit. Martin was 17 years old, Zimmerman, 28. The police report describes Martin as 6 feet tall and 160 pounds and lists Zimmerman as 5-foot-9. Zimmerman sees Martin, deems him ""suspicious"" and calls the police. Zimmerman tells the dispatcher he is following Martin. The dispatcher tells Zimmerman ""we don't need you to do that."" Martin notices Zimmerman is following him and tells his girlfriend, Dee Dee, with whom he is on the phone. She tells him to run, and he agrees to walk quickly. Zimmerman says that he returns to his parked SUV and is attacked suddenly by Martin. Dee Dee hears someone ask Martin why he is there. Martin asks Zimmerman why he is following him. Dee Dee believes she hears Martin being tackled. Witnesses say they heard angry words, heard someone crying for help (many explain it sounded like the voice of a younger person) and then a single gunshot. The screams for help stop. Three witnesses saw Zimmerman straddling Martin in the grass. The incident happens 70 yards from the home Martin was walking to, not near Zimmerman's SUV. Martin is found dead, laying on his stomach. Zimmerman is bleeding from his nose and the back of his head and has stains on the back of his jacket. Zimmerman isn't tested for drug or alcohol consumption and is allowed to leave the police station with the clothes he was wearing that night.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sunny Hostin.","Sunny Hostin: The state attorney has made it clear that she alone will decide on charges .

ff80e03d2134de20dfdf3028605d3217977def52,"Diving 27 meters underwater, the light turns a deep, hazy blue. Emerging from the darkness, three ballerinas in white tutus stretch their legs on the deck of a sunken military ship. It's not a ghostly apparition but one of a series of haunting photographs displayed in the only underwater gallery of its kind in the world. The 12 sumptuous images of everyday scenes -- from a housewife hanging out washing to a teenager watching TV -- take place against the eerie backdrop of sunken ship USNS General Hoyt S.Vandenberg. The 10,000 ton ship -- located off the coast of Florida -- functions as both the backdrop in these evocative photographs and, for a time, the gallery wall on which they're hung. ""Divers must have been checking their oxygen levels to make sure they weren't seeing things,"" said Jed Dodd, executive director of The Studios of Key West, which showed the Vandenberg Project exhibition. ""Diving is already a dreamlike experience and I think these images really correspond with what people imagine an underwater world might look like."" Viennese artist Andreas Franke, who worked as an advertising photographer for more than 20 years, took the powerful images while on a diving exhibition last year. Sunk just off Key West , an island in the Straits of Florida, in 2009, the Vandenberg is the second-largest artificial reef in the world, attracting a diverse range of marine animals and plant life. But before her most recent reincarnation as a divers' paradise, the historic vessel cruised the waves as a U.S. transport ship during World War II. It was this rich history that gave Franke the inspiration for his unique World War II era scenes. The 45-year-old artist used specialist underwater cameras to capture the ship, before heading back to the studio to photograph models in 1940s and 1950s costumes. The retro scenes were then superimposed over the top of the Vandenberg, creating an eerie underwater world frozen in time. ""It's like bringing the Vandenberg back to life,"" Franke said. ""It's a huge empty ship with fish swimming around -- at 27 meters below the surface, the sunlight is this beautiful blue green color. I shot the models in the studio with the same lens, so the images matched."" Around 10,000 divers visited the underwater exhibition and now, after four months sitting on the ocean floor, the unique pictures have come up for air, displayed in their first exhibition on land. Despite being protected between two sheets of plexiglass and sealed with silicon in a steel frame, the images were not left completely untouched by the ravishes of the ocean. The all-pervasive sea water still left its mark, seeping into the frames and discoloring them with salt stains and algae. ""When we brought the photographs to the surface we found all this growth on them -- it's a third dimension on top,"" Franke said. ""The sea life had created new images. It's very cool, they almost look like Polaroids."" The remarkable pictures, worth up to $30,000, had crossed the realm from photographs to performance art, said Dodd. ""The extra layer of growth tells the story of their voyage to the bottom of the seabed,"" he added. ""When they were first brought into the gallery and unpacked, this intense smell went through the building like a windstorm. They feel like living objects."" While the Vandenberg photographs attract art lovers on land, Franke's latest underwater project is bewitching divers again -- this time off the coast of Barbados. Displayed on the sunken SS Stavronikita, the 12 new images depict Renaissance aristocracy gallivanting in a palatial underwater setting. Much like the Vandenberg, Franke superimposed the baroque scenes on top of the former 1950s Greek freighter, where they are now displayed. ""The shipwreck has been down there 35 years so there's this wonderful, overwhelming growth and coral,"" Franke said. ""If you look at the elaborate hairstyles of the models it fits pretty well with this surrounding."" They may appear pristine now, but if the Vandenberg is anything to go by, the lavish ladies of the Stavronikita may not be so picture perfect when they finally come up for air.

ff815f0c90c39da48fb3756293b73468587d8cbf,"(CNN) -- It took less than 10 seconds to bring a steel, 345-ton relic of the Cold War era crashing to the ground in the Nevada desert Wednesday. The 1,527-foot-tall BREN tower was the tallest free-standing structure west of the Mississippi River. It was also the tallest structure of its kind ever demolished, according to the National Nuclear Safety Administration. The tower stood taller than the Empire State Building (1,454 feet) and the Eiffel Tower (1,063 feet). It was also taller than the iconic Stratosphere (1,148 feet) on the Las Vegas strip. Originally constructed in 1962, the BREN Tower took its name from the nuclear radiation experiment for which it was built: Bare Reactor Experiment - Nevada. BREN Tower was designed to provide a way for scientists to accurately estimate radiation doses received by survivors of the atomic bombs detonated over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. The tower stood 1,527 feet tall because that was the height at which ""Little Boy,"" the first atomic bomb used in warfare, was detonated over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. To conduct research at the time, engineers mounted a small unshielded (bare) reactor on the tower and built a mock Japanese village near the base of the tower. The mock village was intended to simulate the shielding effects that rooftops and walls had on radiation, according to Dante Pistone, public affairs manager for the Nevada National Security Site. Scientists used the research to estimate radiation doses residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were subjected to when the bomb detonated. According to the Nevada National Security Site, the data became a cornerstone of modern radiation research. The tower stood in a rural area about 65 miles north of Las Vegas on the Nevada National Security Site. The enormous proving ground is larger than the state of Rhode Island. In 1992 the U.S. government stopped full-scale nuclear testing on the site. Despite its height, in 1966 the U.S. government decided to move the tower to a different location at a cost of $380,000. The move was made so scientists could conduct further experiments using BREN Tower while not disrupting underground nuclear testing in the area, according to the Nevada National Security Site. Last used for research in 1999, in recent years the tower fell into disrepair. The beacons used to alert commercial aviation at the top of the tower had failed, and the elevator used by workers to ascend to the top was no longer safely reliable. It would have cost close to $1 million to repair the tower to its original state. Wednesday's demolition cost about half of what it would have cost to repair the tower.","BREN was the tallest free-standing structure west of the Mississippi River .

Police in crime-riddled New Orleans have arrested and charged a 24-year-old man in connection with the fatal shooting of a toddler who was being carried home from a park. Keelen Armstrong has been booked with first-degree murder in the slaying . of 13-month-old Londyn Samuels. He was also booked with attempted . first-degree murder in the wounding of the child's caretaker. Londyn was being carried by her . 18-year-old nanny on their way home from the park when someone opened . fire on the teen. One of the bullets entered the baby sitter's back and . then struck the toddler in the chest, killing her. The tragic shooting left the New Orleans community reeling after it happened at around 8.20pm on Thursday, August 29, in the city centre. Mayor Mitch Landrieu declared that 'enough is enough' after the shooting in a city struggling with violence. Londyn's heartbroken father, Keion Reed, 20, got a frantic call from his daughter's wounded baby sitter on the night of the shooting telling him that she and the one-year-old had been shot. 'In the back of my head, this is a bad dream I haven't woken up from yet,' Mr Reed told NBC News. Ironically, . at the time of the attack, Londyn's mother, 22-year-old Andrea .

He announced plans for an evening vigil at an intersection near where Londyn Samuels was killed.

Chief Ronal Serpas said he was surprised at the lack of tips to . Crimestoppers, which offers rewards and promises anonymity to people who . phone in information. ‘We know that people in our community know more than they are telling us,’ Serpas said. ‘We would ask the people of New Orleans that know something about this to ask yourself, “What kind of a man would shoot at a woman holding a child?” That's not the kind of person you want to protect.’ 'Persons of interest': New Orleans police released these grainy photos from a surveillance video showing people walking past the crime scene where Londyn and her nanny were shot . Stand-off: Members of the New Orleans Police Department SWAT team move toward an apartment on the 2800 block of LaSalle in New Orleans after three people refused to cooperate with the shooting investigation . The 18-year-old baby sitter and little Londyn were returning home at 8.20pm Thursday when two shots rang out near the intersection of Washington Avenue and South Saratoga Street. The nanny suffered a non-life threatening wound to the back and was able to reach a neighbor's home and call for help. The motive for the shooting was unknown. Londyn's relatives described her as a happy baby who loved music and food, and was just starting to learn how to walk. ‘She was playful. She was a joy and a blessing,’ her aunt Ashley Samuels told NOLA.com. As police officers fanned out throughout the neighborhood to question local residents overnight, two woman and a man were taken in for questioning following a four-hour standoff with a SWAT team in an apartment building in the 2800 block of LaSalle Street. A $5,000 reward is being offered by Crimestoppers. Police issued images from a surveillance video that shows two people — described as ‘persons of interest’ — walking past a house in the area of the shooting. Tragic trend: Londyn, pictured left with her father and right with her aunt, is the fourth child to be killed in Central City neighborhood since 2010 . Mayor Landrieu, who made the fight against violent crime a major issue in his 2010 campaign, said the city has had some success in cutting the murder rate, noting that there have been 97 so far this year, down from 130 at the same point last year. But he said the death of child demonstrates the need for more community involvement. Since 2010, three children between the ages of one and five fell victim to gun violence in the Central City section of New Orleans. ‘It is a lifestyle of murder and death,’ said Brother Walter Umrani, a community activist who patrols the inner-city neighborhood with his New Orleans Peace Keepers, reported the station WWLTV.","Keelan .

In northeastern Baghdad, 20 people were killed and 55 others were wounded in a suicide attack that targeted Shiite pilgrims, police said. The bomber, wearing an explosive vest, detonated among Shiite pilgrims near the al-Amma bridge in the Sunni al-Adhamiya neighborhood. The victims were among thousands of Shiite pilgrims heading to the al-Kadhimiya neighborhood of northwestern Baghdad to commemorate the death of Mohammed al-Jawad, the ninth of the 12 imams in Shiism. In a separate incident in the town of Balad in the north, at least 12 people were killed and 32 others were wounded when a car bomb exploded Saturday evening outside a coffee shop, police said. The town, which is predominantly Shiite, is located in Salaheddin province some 56 miles (90 km) north of Baghdad and has been the site of previous violence. In August 2012, at least 12 people were killed and 45 others were wounded when a suicide bomber wearing an explosive vest blew himself up inside a coffee shop, police said then.

More than 850 Britons are currently locked up in overseas prisons for drug-related offences and face potential jail sentences of up to 39 years or the death penalty. Offences that may carry cautions in the UK are often punished with long prison sentences overseas - and travellers don't realise it. Drugs crimes often carry the most severe sentences, and in 33 countries around the world they carry the death penalty.

Drug mules Michaella Connolly and Melissa Reid are facing a lengthy spell behind bars in Peru after admitting trying to smuggle £1.5million worth of cocaine out of the country. Grandmother Lindsay Sandiford, 57, is facing the death sentence in Bali after being found guilty of smuggling cocaine. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the charity Prisoners Abroad are launching a campaign to show the consequences of drug use and smuggling around the world. Facing the death penalty: Lindsay Saniford, 57, a British grandmother who is being held in a prison cell in Bali . Thailand - Possession of even very small quantities of drugs can lead to imprisonment. If you are found guilty of being in possession of a small quantity of marijuana you are risking a prison sentence and a heavy fine. If you are found guilty of being in possession of in excess of 20 grams of a Class A drug you would be deemed as a trafficker and could potentially be sentenced to death. United Arab Emirates - Sentences for drug trafficking for possession of even the smallest amount of illegal drugs can lead to a minimum four-year jail sentence. The Emirati authorities count the presence of drugs in the blood stream as possession. Peru - More than 30 British nationals are currently in prison in Peru for drugs offences. Drug smugglers face long terms of imprisonment. Indonesia - Possession, trafficking and manufacture of any illegal drugs are serious offences in Indonesia. The Indonesian authorities have a zero-tolerance policy and those caught face lengthy prison sentences or the death penalty, usually after a protracted and expensive legal process. The FCO said the zero-tolerance . approach of some countries often results in strict penalties which can . come as a shock to British travellers. Prisoners Abroad is currently supporting 80 Britons between the ages of 18 and 30 held in foreign countries for drugs offences. Two thirds of these are still awaiting trial while others are serving sentences from a year to nearly 39 years. Consular affairs minister Mark Simmonds said: 'People continue to be astonished at some of the penalties handed down for certain crimes overseas. In some countries possessing small amounts of marijuana can lead to decades in prison. 'In the last year alone consular staff handled over 650 drug-related cases. We want to reduce this number significantly.' He went on: 'Laws, penalties and sentences vary considerably around the world for the use, possession and trafficking of all types of drugs. When it comes to drugs our message is clear - don't take risks, the consequences are simply not worth it.' Prisoners Abroad chief executive Pauline Crowe said: 'In many countries, men and women find themselves without access to food, clean water and the most basic of medical care. 'We urge people to consider the unsanitary conditions, overcrowded cells and the constant threat of disease before they get involved in drugs. They may have to live through these conditions for many, many years.'","British citizens facing up to 39 years behind bars for drugs offences .

On Friday, President Barack Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai agreed to speed up the military transition in that country, meaning Afghan forces will take the lead in combat operations nationwide starting this spring. That transition was previously seen happening mid-year. ""What's going to happen this spring is that Afghans will be in the lead throughout the country. That doesn't mean that coalition forces including U.S. forces are no longer fighting,"" Obama said. ""They will still be fighting alongside Afghan troops. It does mean though that Afghans will have taken the lead and our presence, the nature of our work will be different. We will be in a training, assisting, advising role. ""It will be a historic moment and another step toward full Afghan sovereignty."" What's at stake in Afghanistan: 4 vital questions . The two presidents spoke to reporters in the White House East Room. The mood was cordial, belying the tense relationship of years past. Besides the accelerated timetable, Obama and Karzai agreed that the United States would hand over full control of Afghan prisoners. That demand had been a major sticking point for Karzai, who in return signaled he could be willing to consider immunity for U.S. forces beyond 2014. ""I can go to the Afghan people and argue for immunity for U.S. troops in Afghanistan in a way that Afghan sovereignty will not be compromised, in a way that Afghan law will not be compromised,"" he said. The United States plans to pull all combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of next year. There is discussion, however, of keeping a residual force there to help train security forces and conduct counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda. Obama has been insistent on legal protections. If there is no immunity agreement, the United States might find itself in a similar situation as when it left Iraq. The refusal by the Iraqi government to extend legal protections for U.S. troops after the end of the war there was a major reason the United States left the country with no residual military training force.

'I don't know the answer to that. 'I think . she had a mix of emotions.' Despite the affair, John Edwards wanted to be by Elizabeth's side on her deathbed. 'He called and said, ""Can I come?"" Cate recalled. 'I said, ""Mom, can Dad come?"" And she said ""yes.""' Looking back on their final moments . together, she said, 'The three of us, especially, have been through so . much together, so we garner a lot of strength from one another, and I . think being together during that time - and also for the kids, to have . their family together during that time - was incredibly important.' Cate Edwards has two younger siblings, Emma Claire, who is 14, and Jack, who is 12, who are now being raised by her father. She was very close to her mother, . telling NBC that she was particularly upset by her mother's absence from . her October 2011 wedding. Family: Cate was very close to her mother Elizabeth (seen here in 2008), who died of cancer in 2010, and ever since Cate has been helping raise her younger siblings Emma Claire and Jack . Big day: Cate got married in 2011, and her sister Emma Claire (right) served in the wedding party. She said that her wedding was one of the biggest days that she missed her mother . Love: Cate Edwards' husband says she's a deeply compassionate woman . But she also misses her mother in small ways every day, she said. 'I mean, I get away with bad grammar,' she said, grinning. 'I never used to get away with bad grammar.' The affair between Edwards and Hunter . began while he was campaigning for the highest office in the land back . in 2004, and he waited until it was clear that he would neither be the . presidential nor vice presidential nominee to sit down in 2008 and admit . that he had cheated on his popular wife Elizabeth. In a 2008 interview, Edwards said that he did have an affair with Hunter but he was not the father of her daughter Quinn. He later retracted this statement. Speaking out: Cate was listed as a possible witness during the trial but she was never called to the stand . Throughout the ordeal, Edwards' aide Andrew Young volunteered to pretend that he was the father of Hunter's child, and they used nearly $1million to cover Hunter's tracks, flying her across country with the Youngs and keeping her hidden in various mansions. That money was the focus of the federal trial against Edwards, where they had to prove that the money used to hide Hunter was given by personal donors who understood that it was not so much a political donation to Edwards' campaign but that it was being used to help hide the word of the affair. Cate was actually listed by the defense as a possible witness in Edwards' case, but she was never actually called to the stand. The public attention surrounding the Edwards family drama did not die down after the trial ended in May, as Hunter released a tell-all book just a few months later where she trashed Elizabeth. In her book 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter and Me', Hunter describes the Edwards' marriage as broken by the time she arrived on the scene. Rielle Hunter announced last summer that she and her longtime lover John Edwards are 'no longer a couple' She wrote that Elizabeth- who at the time was battling her second bout of breast cancer- was a 'witch on wheels' who belittled her beloved Johnny and was very aware that their marriage was on the outs. Hunter has faced much criticism for painting such a grim portrait of Elizabeth in her book, especially since she died in 2010 and she can no longer respond to Hunter's claims. That criticism was echoed by Cate in her NBC interview, set to air on Friday. 'I just thought it was — I thought it was a poor choice, I guess, is all I can say,' Cate said diplomatically. As for Hunter's current role in their family, it remains unclear as she said during her book tour that she and 'Johnny' had just decided to end their relationship, though that announcement came just days after they were pictured enjoying a beach vacation with Quinn for Father's Day.","Cate Edwards, 31, said she was 'devastated' and 'disappointed' when her father told her about his affair .

ff839252e52a58de4016703e1f3dccd8ad8a3a80,"Editor's note: CNN executive producer Suzanne Simons is the author of ""Master of War: Blackwater's Erik Prince and the Global Business of War."" Private contractor Xe flies military personnel in Afghanistan and helps train Afghan border police. The company formerly known as Blackwater, now called Xe much to its chagrin, has been at the center of the contractor debate for years. From the time four of its men were ambushed and murdered in Fallujah, Iraq, in 2004, to a shooting involving a team of its men in a Baghdad neighborhood in which at least 14 Iraqi civilians were killed in 2007, the company has drawn unwanted headlines. Blackwater owner Erik Prince downsized the company earlier this year when business failed to keep pace with investment. He changed the company's name after the Iraqi government banned it from doing business there. But those who thought contractors were going away under President Obama's administration couldn't be more wrong. According to the Department of Defense, there are some 68,000 contractors in Afghanistan today and more than 132,000 in Iraq. But those numbers aren't an accurate reflection of the total number of contractors because they don't include those working for other government agencies such as the Department of State. Many of those tens of thousands are third-country nationals, meaning they were hired from a third country to go to Iraq. Many earn between $400 and $700 a month; while Americans, particularly those performing dangerous security duties, can earn as much in a day. Despite being kicked out of Iraq, Xe still does a healthy business in Afghanistan, flying military personnel from one location to another and helping train Afghan border police charged with making the country's massive, porous borders more secure. It's one of the many jobs that the U.S. military just isn't staffed to tackle on its own. In fact, the U.S. military today is beefed up by a force of nearly a quarter million private contractors. There are even cases where contractors oversee the contractors. And that's the problem. The U.S. has come to rely on them so heavily, in such a short period of time, that the government has come under fire for not managing them adequately. Even among the eight-member team that makes up the Wartime Contracting Commission, a congressionally mandated effort to review the contracting process in Iraq and Afghanistan, the question of whether the United States needs the contractors isn't even an issue. The issue, rather, is how well the government is managing this massive support force called up in the immediate aftermath of the war in Iraq. In its interim report released this month, the Commission found that ""neither the military nor the federal civilian acquisition workforces have expanded to keep pace with recent years' enormous growth in the number and value of contingency contracts."" The report also said, ""the government still lacks clear standards and policy on inherently governmental functions. The decision has immediate salience given the decisions to use contractors in armed-security and life-support tasks for military units."" One of the biggest nightmares for legislators is that the force that has grown into such a critical modern-day military support structure was for a long time operating in a legal gray zone with no clear avenue of justice should something unsavory occur. That has led to some tough work for both prosecutors and the FBI, as they take on the task of investigating allegations of wrongdoing by contractors overseas. Doug Brooks, head of the IPOA, an industry-friendly voluntary organization made up of 62 companies, spends much of his time doing outreach and making sure member companies measure up to the internal standards. ""We have the power to kick people out of the association,"" Brooks said, but that's about where it ends. They can't prosecute anyone.  But to say that there has been no progress on the legal front wouldn't be fair. Legislation has been passed that essentially holds contractors accountable for their actions under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act, but with everything in this business, there was a hang-up with that, too.  The legislation was written to cover contractors working in support of the Department of Defense, but there are even more contractors working in support of the State Department and other U.S. agencies. The Special Inspector General for Iraq, Stuart W. Bowen Jr. produced a report in February titled Hard Lessons: The Iraq Reconstruction Experience. He then testified before Congress that ""the United States government was unprepared and ill-equipped to mount a major contingency relief and reconstruction program in Iraq in 2003. For the last six years we have been on a steep learning curve."" He also told members of Congress that the United States relies too heavily on the hired help, testifying that ""outsourcing management to contractors should be limited because it complicates lines of authority in contingency reconstruction operations."" Something that retired Lt. Gen. Richard Sanchez would undoubtedly agree with.   Sanchez, who led the U.S. military operation in the early days of the Iraq war, has launched an information campaign aimed at bringing more accountability to the debate. He's even called for a truth commission to investigate policies regarding the interrogation of detainees.   Guess what. Contractors were involved in that scandal, too. As for Blackwater, scandal, or the suspicion of it, played a significant role in its downturn. Plagued by lawsuits and federal investigations, the company now called Xe is a shell of what Blackwater was five years ago. Most of Prince's top executives are gone, budgets have been dramatically curtailed and the company has largely returned to its roots, as a training facility for law enforcement and special forces.   Is Blackwater's fate a sign that things are sour in the industry? Hardly. As IPOA's Brooks puts it, they're here to stay, its about time we made it work. ""I think the other conclusion that companies have come to is that we're going to be working with the private sector. Nobody wants soldiers to go back to flipping eggs, guarding gates, that kind of thing.""","Blackwater, now Xe, has garnered unwanted attention over the past few years .
Though kicked out of Iraq, Xe does a great deal of business in Afghanistan .
Bottom line: U.S. relies heavily on private military contractors .

ff83b52b794802b2066dee0b67879b8b3a3684b2,"(CNN) -- Maria Sharapova remains on course to complete a career slam after she set up a French Open semifinal showdown with Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. The Russian dispatched Kaia Kanepi, from Estonia, 6-2 6-3 and now needs just two more victories to join an exclusive club in the game who have won all four grand slam titles. The world No. 2 has reached the final four at Roland Garros twice before and beat Kvitova, from the Czech Republic, in the semifinals in Stuttgart -- a tournament she went on to win. But Kvitova's only grand slam win to date came at last year's Wimbledon tournament, when she beat Sharapova in straight sets in the final. ""It's nice to be in this position again,"" Sharapova told the WTA Tour's official website. ""It's my third time in the semifinals here. ""Petra's an extremely tough opponent, someone I have had good success in our last couple of meetings, but they're always tough matches. ""The last one in Stuttgart was a tough two-setter for me -- she had opportunities in that second set and when she's confident, she's dangerous. It's going to be another level. I hope I can raise my level, as well."" None of the four French Open semifinalists has tasted success in Paris, but Sharapova has the most major championships to her name, with three overall. The Russian never looked in any trouble against Kanepi, breaking her opponent seven times en route to a swift victory, and the 26-year-old admitted she could not live with Sharapova's power. ""She attacked all the time, I didn't have any time to hit my shots and I just couldn't get any rhythm out there,"" Kanepi explained. ""I was also very nervous and I am just sorry I didn't get to spend more time on the court. Maria is playing really well, she can win the tournament."" Kvitova, the No. 4 seed, dropped the first set against qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan, who knocked out defending champion Li Na in the previous round, but battled back to win 3-6 6-2 6-4. It ended Shvedova's hopes of becoming the first qualifier ever to reach the Roland Garros semis, and propelled Kvitova closer to her second grand slam final appearance. ""Every point that we played was really tough,"" Kvitova said in a courtside interview. ""I knew that I had to change my game. ""It wasn't easy and I'm really happy that my serve helped me and I played my aggressive game again."" The other semifinal sees Australia's Samantha Stosur, the No. 6 seed, square off against Italian Sara Errani, the No. 21 seed.","Maria Sharapova to meet Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in French Open semis .

He gathered a crowd of about 20 Christian youths who forced the bus driver to stop and dragged him from the bus. Without emotion he told the BBC: 'I poured petrol over him. I burned him. I ate his leg, right down the white bone.' Witnesses did not intervene but recorded the footage on mobile phones, including the act of cannibalism.

The New Zealander was on a business trip when she met up with a man from mobile dating app Tinder. The woman told police they met at a restaurant in Kings Cross - Sydney's inner city - before the pair moved on to a bar in Martin Place and was later joined by the man's friends. But she believes her drink got spiked after she felt dizzy, numb and later found herself at an unknown property. She says this was where she was sexually assaulted by the group of men. Scroll down for video . Police warned that Tinder-users should take extra caution when meeting people from online as they are of 'sexual predators out there who use modern technology to find potential victims' This comes after a New Zealand woman met up with a man at Kings Cross, Sydney's inner city, on Saturday night after speaking to him through mobile dating app Tinder . Police say the pair then moved on to a bar in Martin Place where they were joined by the man's friends . The woman was able to leave the property, believed to be in the Botany area in Sydney's south, on Sunday morning. She told colleagues about the incident before they informed police. Police warned that Tinder-users should take extra caution when meeting people from online. 'The vast majority of people who use dating websites and apps do so for the right reasons but there are a number of sexual predators out there who use modern technology to find potential victims,' Detective Inspector Michael Haddow said. He further advised that those thinking of meeting someone from dating websites or apps should bring a friend on the date. 'It's absolutely vital that people using dating websites and apps remember that how a person portrays themselves on the internet can be very different from their real life persona,' Detective Inspector Haddow said. 'With this in mind, we strongly advise people that if they decide to meet a person they have been introduced to via the internet, then ensure the meeting is in a public place and take a friend along with you. 'Having a friend there ensures that one of you can always keep an eye on your drink, and you have someone to turn to who can help you out should you feel threatened or uncomfortable. 'If it's not possible to bring a friend with you, then, at the very least, stay in regular contact with a family member or friend, keeping them abreast of how the night is going and where you may be heading to.' The man, who met the New Zealand tourist in Kings Cross, is described as being of Pacific Islander/Maori appearance. The woman was treated at a Sydney hospital on Monday but has now returned to New Zelaand where she is being supported by family.

One of the firm's suppliers says a band linked to the firm's hugely successful Xbox One console is set for release next year. It will be linked to games on the console, and is also expected to make use of the Kinect sensors the console has to track players. Scroll down for video . Late on the bandwagon? Microsoft has launched a device called 'Microsoft Band' (pictured) that will allow users to monitor their fitness and exercise regime. now it is believed to be working on an Xbox version. Speaking to PCR Joe Officer, head of attach at Exertis - an Xbox One supplier - said: 'The wearable market is always growing and we can expect to see Microsoft rolling out a spate of devices next year in this space,' according to PCR. 'These will be linked to the Xbox One which has loads of health and fitness apps already in it - add that to real time heart rate monitors, health bands, scales and video sensors and users will have day in, day out, real time monitoring of themselves.' The Xbox One already offers fitness games for users that can track their movements in real time. Fitbit and rival exercise bands have been around for a few years, but the world's largest . software company's has only now made its debut into the wearable technology market, launching an exercise band, smartwatch hybrid. Microsoft has revealed its device, called 'Microsoft Band,' which will allow users to monitor their fitness and exercise regime, as well as check their texts and emails. The wrist-worn device has 10 smart sensors that monitor pulse rate, . measure calorie burn and track sleep quality, Microsoft said in . a blog post. It also offers guided workouts, which are drills designed to meet a user's needs and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have run or cycled. The Kinect sensor for the Xbox can already track a  user's movements as they work out in front of the camera . 'Microsoft Band makes it easier to reach your fitness goals. You can track your daily physical activity and review your stats with a glance at your wrist,' the Redmond, Washington-based company writes on its website. 'Just like a personal trainer, Microsoft Band guides you to improved wellness by constantly learning about you, your current fitness level, and your future needs.' Unlike the forthcoming Apple Watch, people won't be able to make phone calls from the device, but like other smartwatches, such as the Motorola 360, they will be able to read texts, emails, social media updates and other notifications. 'It also helps you be more productive with email previews and calendar alerts - right on your wrist,' the company,' Microsoft said. Users will be able to talk to their device using the Cortana personal assistant, which is similar to Apple's Siri. Using Windows 8.1, users can ask Cortana to take notes or set reminders. 'She'll give you driving directions and keep you on top of traffic spots, weather and more,' according to Microsoft. The wrist-worn device (pictured left) has sensors that monitor pulse rate,measure calorie burn and track sleep quality, Microsoft said. It works alongside a health app called 'Microsoft Health' (shown on various devices) that includes a cloud service for users to store and combine health and fitness data . Fitness functions: The band is primarily a fitness band. It features smart sensors that monitor pulse rate, measure calorie burn and track sleep quality. The device also offers workouts put together by Men's Health, for example, and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have ran or cycled. Smartwatch features: The device doesn't allow people to make calls directly, but does push notifications about calls, texts and emails from a user's smartphone to their Microsoft Band. It has Microsoft's Cortana personal assistant built-in so people can talk to the device to ask it to take notes or set reminders, for example. Appearance: The band is primarily made of rubber and features a sleek colour touchscreen. Users can change the background screen's colour and design. Sensors: It has 10 sensors that monitor everything from heart rate and sleep to UV, prompting wearers to apply sunscreen. Price: $199. Availability: US only from today. UK prices and availability haven't been announced yet. Microsoft Band has a rubber strap and colour touch screen with a customisable background. It also has a UV sensor that tells wearers when to apply sunscreen. The device is designed to work alongside iPhone, Android and Windows Phone handsets, and will be available in the United . States from today for $199. UK availability and pricing has yet to be announced. It will compete with the highly anticipated Apple Watch, which was unveiled  on September 9 and is set to go on sale in early 2015 for $349. Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics is already selling its Galaxy Gear smart watch and Motorola and LG also have versions on the market. Microsoft also launched a health app called 'Microsoft . Health' that includes a cloud service for users to store and . combine health and fitness data. The  app will collect data from the fitness . band and will work on iPhones and Android smartphones, as well . as the Windows Phone. Microsoft Health will unite data from different health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper, in a single location. Data from different devices and services, such as steps, calories and heart rate will be combined, enabling an 'Intelligence Engine' to say which exercises were most effective during a workout and suggest a recommended recovery time. Over time, data can be combined with a calendar, enabling the Intelligence Machine to get smarter and offer suggestions for workouts that fit with a user's schedule, Microsoft said. As well as being a fitness tracker, the band enables wearers to see their emails, calender, texts, social media updates and other push notifications on their wrist. The device will be available in the US in limited quantities from today for $199 . Microsoft Band contains built-in GPS and 24-hour heart rate monitoring, which the company says is to help wearers reach their fitness goals. 'By combining the power of each of our sensors, Microsoft Band is able to give you real-time insights into your performance today and your milestones into the future,' the company says . Ben Wood Chief of Research CCS Insight said Microsoft's move to launch a health-tracking wearable isn't surprising and puts it in direct competition with Apple's iHealth and Google Fit as well as the plethora of proprietary health platforms from companies such as FitBit, Jawbone and Withings. 'Consumers now have an overwhelming choice of health-related cloud platforms to choose from...It's going to be a tough decision to choose whether to place their loyalty with Apple, Google or Microsoft given the immaturity of all three platforms. 'The Microsoft Band enters a highly competitive market where the company has little or no brand. At $200 Microsoft is targeting the higher tiers of the fitness band market – its going to have make a big marketing investment to raise awareness with US consumers. 'There are already numerous other products with heart rate sensors that track fitness and sleep including the new product Fitbit announced earlier this week. 'It's interesting that Microsoft is clearly positioning its product as a fitness band rather than a smart watch given it has many of the features several smart watches already support. It is banking on the fact that consumers don't want to replace their watches and that this will be what it calls the 'band for the other hand''. Fitbit has revealed a trio of new trackers this week - including a $250 smartwatch, which it hopes can take on the Apple Watch. Called Surge, the watch has GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality. The firm has also added a heart rate monitor to its traditional tracing wristband, now called the chargeHR. Fitbit's new range includes the $129 Fitbit charge, the $149 chargeHR while also has a heart rate sensors, and the $249 Surge which has GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality. Fitbit's new range: The $129 Fitbit charge, the $149 chargeHR (pictured) have a heart rate sensors, and the $249 Surge comes with GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality .

The violent, long-distance rampage took Pedro Maldonado Sr. from one end of the state to the other. While the Broward County Sheriff's Office continues to piece together a time line, detectives believe Maldonado shot and killed his 47-year-old wife, Monica Narvaez-Maldonado, and their 17-year-old son, Pedro Maldonado Jr., with a crossbow in their Weston townhouse sometime on Monday. Weston is located about 13 miles west of Fort Lauderdale. The sheriff's report says Maldonado, 53, then drove about 460 miles north to Tallahassee in an attempt to kill his older son, JosÃ© Maldonado, who attends Florida State University. ""His dad did try to shoot him with the same handheld crossbow and the arrow hit Jose's ear,"" Dani Moschella, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's department, told CNN affiliate WSVN. ""Then his father tried to choke him, and JosÃ© luckily was able to get away."" JosÃ© Maldonado never reported the attack to police, but it was his father's confession to a friend on Tuesday that set authorities on his trail. The Broward Sheriff's report says Pedro Maldonado called a friend in Miami and admitted to killing his wife and son. A short time later, authorities found their bodies in the South Florida townhouse. Did Montana newlywed blindfold husband before pushing him off cliff? Later in the day, authorities learned that Maldonado might be in the Lake City area, about 100 miles east of Tallahassee.

A survey by Anglian Home Improvements into the impact of reduced daylight over the winter months found that the vast majority of us feel it has a negative impact on our wellbeing. Their report claims 79 per cent of us feel that limited hours of daylight has a negative effect on our mood. A spokesman for the company which quizzed 2,000 respondents said: ‘The survey shows a clear link between natural daylight, mood and motivation. ‘It’s encouraging to learn that little changes, like making sure you sit near a window or somewhere with as much natural light as possible, can make a big difference to how we feel and cope with winter.’ It has been suggested that the concept of ‘Blue Monday’ was based on junk science drummed up by a travel company as a clever ploy to have us booking holidays to sunnier climes. It is thought the date was picked out by psychologist Cliff Arnall after he came up with a scientific formula based on the length of time until next Christmas, holiday debt and the likelihood of giving up New Year’s resolutions. Mr Arnall first wrote about ‘Blue Monday’ seven years ago - in a press release for Sky Travel, a now defunct British TV travel channel. He based the theory on the ‘hibernation’ effect - a time of year when people feel tired, don’t exercise, stay indoors and eat comfort food. He has said previously: ‘It is the combination of factors that make life right now particularly uncertain. ‘There is threat of job redundancy and the cost of food and fuel are going up.’ Since the idea of Blue Monday has become well known Mr Arnall, from Brecon, Wales, has admitted the idea of a single most depressing day was ‘not particularly helpful’ because it became ‘a self-fulfilling prophecy’ and that achieving happiness and being less materialistic was a year-round aim.","Woes include travel chaos, feeling poor after Christmas and lack of daylight .

ff8624fc068e825c6c0ba602ae8c2aa889ee7abb,"(CNN) -- A former Florida middle school principal stabbed four people Friday at a group home for the hearing impaired, killing two of them, then struck five others with a car, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office said. The suspect -- identified by the sheriff's office as Anthony Giancola -- was taken into police custody after being tracked down by K-9 unit members. He has been arrested and formally booked on two counts of first-degree murder, sheriff's spokeswoman Cecilia Barreda said. Authorities said they first learned around 10:45 a.m. that four people had been stabbed at the group home in Lealman, a community just north of St. Petersburg. One man, later identified as 27-year-old Justin Lee Vanderbergh, was pronounced dead at the scene, the sheriff's office said. Three women were sent to a local hospital, where one of them -- 59-year-old Mary Anne Allis -- ended up succumbing to her injuries. The other two, ages 25 and 43, suffered what the sheriff's office said were non-life-threatening injuries. All four stabbed were the only residents of the one-story home, Barreda said. After talking with witnesses, authorities identified the suspect as the 45-year-old Giancola. The suspect fled the scene and headed toward a motel in nearby Pinellas Park, where a man and woman were assaulted, authorities said. The sheriff's office said the man's injuries ""appear to be life-threatening."" From there, the suspect left and is thought to have spoken briefly to people outside a duplex before abruptly leaving, then returning in his vehicle -- slamming into three women and one man in the process. The women were all transported to an area hospital, while the man chose not to go. The sheriff's office said the suspect then drove west and struck another person, this time a 13-year-old boy. The child suffered only minor injuries. The suspect ended up at the Egg Platter restaurant in Pinellas Park, where he left his vehicle, entered another vehicle and fled. He was detained shortly after 1 p.m., the sheriff's office said. Barreda explained that the sheriff's office is only responsible for levying charges in certain areas, adding that Giancola could face more charges from police in other jurisdictions for the alleged assaults and hit-and-runs. He is now in Pinellas County Jail awaiting his initial court appearance. It was not clear whether he had retained a lawyer. This is not Giancola's first run-in with the law. In February 2007, when he was a principal at a middle school in Hillsborough County, he was caught buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer -- an exchange captured on video that happened inside his principal's office while school was in session. Months later, he pleaded guilty and that June told CNN that there was ""no excuse for my behavior."" Giancola said at his sentencing that he hoped to become a drug counselor after being released from jail. ""Before I could ever hope to go on and help anyone again, I need to help myself,"" Giancola told CNN. ""I'm very thankful I was arrested, and it kind of brought that crazy train to an end."" Then, in early 2010, Giancola was arrested again and charged on two counts -- intent to purchase cocaine and loitering -- according to online records from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. CNN's Greg Botelho and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","Anthony Giancola is in custody on 2 first-degree murder counts, with more charges possible .

The remarks come from Nebraska-based Judge Richard Kopf, who has a reputation for provocative commentary on his personal blog. Kopf, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, criticized the high court's ruling last week in the so-called ""Hobby Lobby"" case. The decision gave some for-profit businesses the right to deny birth control coverage to their employees if they opposed on religious grounds. The 5-4 decision against a provision of Obamacare was predictably divided in public opinion. The senior judge made clear his views on Saturday. ""Five male Justices of the Supreme Court, who are all members of the Catholic faith and who each were appointed by a President who hailed from the Republican party, decided that a huge corporation, with thousands of employees and gargantuan revenues, was a 'person' entitled to assert a religious objection to the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate because that corporation was 'closely held' by family members,"" he wrote. ""To the average person, the result looks stupid and smells worse."" And he went further. ""Next term is the time for the Supreme Court to go quiescent-- this term and several past terms has proven that the court is now causing more harm (division) to our democracy than good by deciding hot button cases that the court has the power to avoid. As the kids say, it is time for the Court to stfu."" Kopf helpfully linked to the Urban Dictionary to help decipher the popular acronym. It is not the first time his words have attracted attention on his blog, which he describes as enlightening ""the role of the federal trial judge."" During last year's budget battle in Washington and partial government shutdown, Kopf spoke for many federal judges in expressing frustration over forced furloughs and reduction of court services. But most judges hold their tongue on such matters, in an effort to appear above the fray. Not Kopf: ""Tell Congress to go to hell-- all federal court employees are essential."" And he was criticized for a March blog posting entitled: ""On being a dirty old man and how young women lawyers dress."" He later offered his regrets at the comments, saying, ""The only thing bigger than my ass is my ego."" There was no immediate reaction from the Supreme Court to Kopf's latest comments, and unclear whether the 68-year-old judge would be subject to some internal sanction. CNN spoke with Kopf's office, which had no comment other than to confirm the latest posting was his. Federal judges in particular have to adhere to a Code of Conduct, which says in part they ""should respect and comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary."" Moreover, it also says they must avoid even the appearance of impropriety. This prohibition covers professional and personal conduct. The wide-ranging and often deeply personal thoughts on Kopf's blog-- which he has authored since February 2013-- reflect what he says is a desire that ""federal trial judges be seen as individuals with all the strengths and weaknesses (baggage) that everyone else carries around."" In the wake of the ""stfu"" comment, he is again rethinking his online future. He wrote on Monday: ""Blogging will be light while I figure this out. While I will make up my own mind, advice (anonymous or otherwise), particularly from experienced lawyers and judges, would be welcome.""

The home appliance company Beko has secured the rights to feature their design on the sleeve of both the team’s jersey and the club’s training kit, as Barcelona demonstrate their full immersion into the corporate world. Barcelona have traditionally been resistant to excessive commercialism, refusing to follow the lead of their global rivals and until 2006, they remained steadfast in their determination not to have a sponsor on their shirt. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Barcelona unveil their new kit for the 2014/15 season . Sold: The Beko logo can be seen on the sleeves of Barcelona's home kit after the deal was announced .

However, they finally relented and allowed the children’s charity UNICEF to occupy centre stage on their famous blaugrana shirt, before the Qatar Foundation, another charity, took pride of place from 2010. However, in 2013 many fans were left disappointed when the club made the step away from 112 years of history to allow Qatar Airways to emblazon their name across the scarlet and blue jersey in a five year sponsorship agreement. Now, Barca have not one but two sponsors on their shirt. The club are also further exploring the potential of the Catalan brand, with Beko becoming a global sponsor for the next four years. A statement read: ‘FC Barcelona and Beko announced today the signing of a new agreement which will see the global home appliance group become the club’s worldwide sponsorship partner for the next four years.

Two men pleaded guilty Thursday to a 2011 beating at Dodger Stadium that left San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow brain damaged and severely disabled. They were immediately sentenced by an angry judge who called them cowards and the sort of people that sports fans fear when go to games. Louie Sanchez, 31, saying he kicked and punched Stow, pleaded guilty to one count of mayhem that disabled and disfigured the victim. He was sentenced to eight years in prison with credit for 1,086 days. Marvin Norwood pleaded guilty to one count of assault likely to produce great bodily injury and was sentenced to four years. His credit for time already in custody appeared to account for at least the majority of that term. Scroll down for video . Marvin Norwood, left, and Louie Sanchez even appeared to smirk as they were sentenced to several years in prison on Thursday . 'Cretins': David Stone - the father of beating victim Bryan Stow - lashed out at his attackers, and comforted his daughter Evin Collins - left . They were sentenced after Stow's family addressed the court. David Stow, the victim's father, placed a Giants ball cap on a podium. 'The years you spend in prison is what you cretins deserve,' he said. The victim's sister, Bonnie Stow, described her brother's life. 'We shower him, we dress him, we fix his meals,' she said. 'We make sure he gets his 13 medications throughout the day. He takes two different anti-seizure medications to prevent the seizures he endured for months after you brutally and cowardly attacked him.' Superior Court Judge George Lomeli called out Sanchez for smirking during sentencing. 'You not only ruined the life of Mr. Stow (but) his children, his family, his friends,' the judge said. Paramedic Bryan Stow, pictured before the attack, was suffered traumatic brain damage from the attack . He said the men only seemed to care when they will getting out of jail. 'One day you will be released,' he said, 'and Mr. Stow will forever be trapped in the condition you left him in.' The judge said he often takes his son to football games and 'my biggest fear is that we might run into people like you, who have no civility.' He concluded, 'it's only a game at the end of the day and you lost perspective.' Stow, a 45-year-old paramedic from Santa Cruz who attended the 2011 opening day game in Los Angeles between the Dodgers and the Giants, was beaten nearly to death in a parking lot after the game. He suffered brain damage and is permanently disabled, requiring 24-hour-a-day care. The beating prompted public outrage and led to increased security at Dodgers' games. A civil suit by Stow is pending against the Dodgers organization and former owner Frank McCourt. Sanchez and Norwood were arrested after a lengthy manhunt that briefly involved the arrest of an innocent man. The two acknowledged their involvement during a series of secretly recorded jailhouse conversations. Norwood was recorded telling his own mother by phone that he was involved and saying, 'I will certainly go down for it.' Stow, seen after the attack, no longer can care for himself and requires the constant attention of his family . The words the two men spoke in a jail lockup, unaware they were being recorded, were played at a preliminary hearing as they were ordered to stand trial on charges of mayhem and assault and battery. In a 12-minute conversation, Sanchez acknowledged he attacked a Giants fan, and Norwood said he had no regrets about backing him up. 'I socked him, jumped him and started beating him,' a transcript of the conversation quoted Sanchez, who also apologized to Norwood for dragging him into the fight. 'That happens, bro,' said Norwood. 'I mean, what kind of man would I have been if I hadn't jumped in and tried to help you.' Witnesses testified about the parking lot confrontation, saying Stow was jumped from behind and his head crashed to the pavement. Witnesses at the hearing said Sanchez taunted Giants fans throughout the game. Two witnesses who attended the March 31, 2011, game told of being bothered by Sanchez, who was throwing peanuts and spraying soda on a woman in the bleachers. His sister testified that Sanchez was drunk. Corey Maciel, a fellow paramedic who came with Stow from Northern California to cheer for the Giants, told of seeing his friend attacked and throwing his own body over him to prevent further harm. 'As soon as he was punched, he was unconscious and fell back on his head,' Maciel testified. 'He was unable to brace himself. I saw his head bounce off the concrete. I heard the crack.' The assailant then kicked Stow in the head at least three times and again in the torso, according to the testimony. Maciel said he heard profanities and one person say, '(expletive) the Giants. That's what you get.' 'I threw my body over Bryan's head to stop any more physical contact,' Maciel said. Another friend, also a paramedic, held the injured Stow's head to protect his spine. But he had already suffered devastating injuries. Last spring, Stow returned home after two years in hospitals and rehabilitation centers. His family said he requires constant physical therapy and remains severely disabled.","Bryan Stow was beaten nearly to death by rival fans while attending an LA Dodgers game .

ff86997232b53c55576f614c9e74d61b8207ef9a,"(CNN) -- The fledgling International Premier Tennis League suffered a blow when two of the world's most recognized female athletes snubbed the event. Max Eisenbud, the agent of both Maria Sharapova and Li Na, told CNN on Thursday that neither would be appearing in the team tournament that is set to make its debut in Asia this November. Sharapova transcends tennis and has long been a magnet for sponsors -- the Russian is perennially listed as the world's richest female athlete by Forbes -- while China's Li is one of the marquee names in Asia, having captured a second grand slam title at the Australian Open in January. Li was ""confirmed"" as one of the entrants by the League in a press release last May. ""Maria and Li Na will not be participating,"" Eisenbud said in an email. Mahesh Bhupathi, a grand slam doubles winner and the main man behind the project modeled after cricket's highly successful Indian Premier League, will now be hoping he can secure the likes of Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Roger Federer, the 17-time grand slam champion and still the biggest name in the sport, told Gulf News this week he generally backed the idea. The player list is expected to be revealed Friday. ""Firstly, I want to see whether it takes off or not,"" Federer told Gulf News. ""I know a lot of people have invested in it or are part of it. Anywhere where tennis grows is a good thing, so I hope it takes off and becomes very successful. ""In Asia, there is enormous potential (for tennis to grow), in places like China and India due to the amount of people that live there and the excitement they have for tennis."" The tournament sees five teams -- based in Mumbai, Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and another city yet to be officially revealed -- play each other over a roughly three-week period. Matches are contested over five sets but will employ no-ad scoring. One set is played in each of men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, mixed doubles and legends doubles. Optimism was initially high, with Boris Becker a founding partner of the league and Djokovic -- now coached by Becker -- calling it a ""revolutionary idea."" However, there have been delays in the player auction and the League was originally supposed to have six teams, not five. ""I think it will be great for tennis if it can be pulled off,"" said Eisenbud. ""I just don't see how it could ever work, but I hope I am wrong,"" he added without elaborating. A tennis insider who spoke on the condition of anonymity told CNN he didn't know if the TV revenue was in place to fund salaries and other costs. However, Peter Hutton, CEO of MP and Silva, the firm distributing television rights, said there has been ""considerable interest both in Asia and outside."" ""We've been waiting to see the selection of the franchise squads before finalizing any broadcast deals,"" he told CNN. ""Mahesh's personal credibility and his contacts within the world of tennis have made people sit up and take notice, and we believe that the 'made for tv' format is a good model on which to grow audiences for tennis worldwide."" Bhupathi didn't return an email seeking comment Thursday. Apart from who will show up, another question is: How can players complain about a long tennis year but then commit a chunk of the off-season to a tournament? Pros from the U.S. and Europe also face the prospect of making the long trip to Asia -- after completing the Asian chunk of the schedule weeks or a month before.","Maria Sharapova and Li Na won't be competing in the new IPTL, their agent says .

ff86a753ef4a053e3d24d769f028b57567cb3d57,"(CNN)Books, filled with prayers for peace, splattered with blood. Sacred vestments shredded by bullets and knives. Lifeless bodies in the sanctuary. The rabbis had gathered to ask God to bestow blessings upon their troubled land. Their prayers were interrupted by two men wielding butcher knives and a gun. An Israeli police officer and four rabbis were killed, including an American whose family is considered ""rabbinic royalty."" Combined with the site of the slaughter -- a synagogue in West Jerusalem -- the targeting of rabbis struck at the soul of Jews around the world, several Jewish leaders said Tuesday. ""This is an attack on all of us,"" said Rabbi Shmuel Herzfeld, who leads Ohev Sholom Synagogue in Washington. ""Any terrorist attack is a horror. But to attack people while they are engaged in prayer, are talking to God, is a new low."" In fact, both sides in the seemingly endless fight between Israelis and Palestinians have attacked people at prayer. In 1994, a Jewish extremist murdered 29 Palestinians worshiping in Hebron. In 2002, Palestinian extremists attacked a Passover Seder in Natanya, killing 30. Like those assaults, Tuesday's murders threaten to ignite another inferno of unholy violence. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack, but Hamas and other Palestinians praised the terrorists, identified by police as two cousins from East Jerusalem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office vowed to ""respond with a heavy hand"" to the killings. The attackers, identified as Ghassan Abu Jamal and his cousin Udayy Abu Jamal, were killed by police responding to the synagogue assault, authorities said. Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokesman for Hamas, linked the attack to the discovery Sunday of a Palestinian bus driver hanged in his bus not far from the synagogue where the rabbis were killed. But relatives of the terrorists told The New York Times  the men were motivated by Israel's recent closure of Jerusalem's Temple Mount/Noble Sanctuary compound, a site holy to both Jews and Muslims. The site has since been reopened, but the dispute has fueled small-scale attacks by Palestinians that have killed six Israelis in recent weeks. In the United States, the horror of Tuesday's terror attack unified Jews across the political spectrum, even those who sharply disagree with Netanyahu's handling of the Israeli-Palestinian crisis. In an editorial, the Jewish Daily Forward said the frustration of Palestinians ""living under occupation"" is understandable. But killing innocent men at prayer is morally indefensible, the newspaper said, noting that the synagogue is in West Jerusalem, not in ""contested territory."" Killing innocents anywhere is detestable, Jewish leaders said Tuesday. But there is something especially heinous about killing people while they pray. ""We look on our ministers, priests, rabbis and mullahs as intermediaries between ourselves in the divine world,"" said Peter Machinist, a professor of Hebrew at Harvard University. Within the slain rabbis' ultra-Orthodox tradition, respected rabbis are assumed to have a ""hot line to heaven."" ""So an attack on them is a little closer to being an attack on God,"" Machinist said. The four rabbis killed were: Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, 58; Aryeh Kopinsky, 43; Moshe Twersky, 59; and Calman Levine. Goldberg was a dual British-Israeli citizen, and the other three were U.S.-Israeli citizens. ""This was an attack by Palestinian terrorists of pure evil and would have been utterly deplorable wherever, whenever it had occurred,"" said Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the former chief of rabbi of Britain. ""But for this terrorist attack to occur in a synagogue, deliberately targeting innocent Jews deep in prayer, is something that strikes at the soul of Jewish people around the world."" Obama condemns 'horrific' Jerusalem terror attack . The Muslim Political Affairs Council also condemned Tuesday's attack. ""We strongly believe that houses of worship should be a sanctuary for all people, not a place of violence as we regretfully witnessed today. Islam commands its followers to protect houses of worship,"" the group said in a statement on Twitter. Moshe Twersky, originally from Boston, comes from an almost Kennedy-like clan of respected scholars and rabbis. His father, Rabbi Isadore Twersky, was a world-renowned expert on Jewish theology and founding director of Harvard's Center for Jewish learning. Twersky's maternal grandfather was Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik, a philosopher and professor at Yeshiva University who was considered one of the most important minds in Modern Orthodox Judaism. ""It's a very prominent family in Jewish life, in Jewish scholarship, in Jewish theology,"" Machinist said. Herzfeld said Soloveitchik was responsible for training thousands of rabbis who passed through Yeshiva University in New York, where his legacy still burns bright. Twersky's brother, Mayer, teaches at the university. Family legacy aside, what makes Tuesday's attack all the more galling, Jewish leaders said, is that the rabbis planned to engage in the very opposite of terrorism: praying for peace. ""That's what's so horrible about this,"" said Herzfeld. ""These people were trying to do their part to bring good into this world through their dedication to God."" 'Grief and outrage' at Jerusalem synagogue slayings . Other Jewish leaders noted that the rabbis likely did not expect their morning service to be interrupted by an assault. ""If you are truly at prayer, you are most vulnerable,"" said Jane Eisner, the Forward's editor-in-chief. Worshipers are not looking around for potential terrorists; they are focused on God. During the central prayer of Jewish services, the Amidah, it is considered sacrilegious to interrupt worshipers. ""Amidah"" means ""standing"" in Hebrew, and Jews are taught to imagine themselves standing before God, asking for his blessing, said Herzfeld. By tradition, the last prayer asks for peace in Israel. It's unclear whether the rabbis had reached that point when the slaughter began.","Killing of rabbis strikes at soul of Jews around the world, Jewish leaders say .

A motorist caught running red lights and swerving between lanes claimed he was 'under the influence' of drum and bass music. Delivery driver Aaron Cogley, 25, said he was 'high' on the 'intoxicating effects' of his favourite music, which he said made him drive erratically. Police spotted him running two sets of red lights in Bristol and then 'cut up' another driver. Aaron Cogley was banned from driving for 12 months at Bristol Crown Court, pictured, after he admitted dangerous driving but said it was because of the 'intoxicating' effects of drum and base . Bristol Crown Court was told Cogley then rounded a corner so sharply his van rocked on its chassis. Officers pulled him over but he passed a drink and drugs test. When asked why he was driving erratically he blamed his drum and bass. Cogley, of Portishead, Bristol, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and his defence team argued he had been 'intoxicated' by the music. David Miller, defending, said: 'It was stupid. He was carried away because of the intoxicating effects of drum and bass music.' Passing sentence, Recorder Mr Kevin De Haan QC described drum and bass as 'Intoxicating for some. Very irritating for others.' Cogley was ordered to do 80 hours unpaid work, was banned from driving for 12 months and ordered to pass an extended driving test and pay a £60 victim surcharge. Mark Hollier, prosecuting, said police in an unmarked car spotted Cogley driving his Ford van in the streets near Bristol Royal Infirmary. Cogley was seen swerving between lanes and driving erratically in the roads surrounding Bristol Royal Infirmary, pictured . He 'cut up' a motorist, drove slowly through two sets of red lights before swerving from lane to lane as he headed towards a train station. Police rushed the vehicle and Cogley was arrested and breathalysed, but blew a zero reading. Mr Hollier said: 'When asked about it he said he was listening to drum and bass and was in a hurry.' Recorder Haan QC told Cogley: 'It's always serious, dangerous driving. 'Even if you only went up to 40mph you were lucky that night. 'You could have had an accident and been hurt, or worse you could have hurt someone else. Police thought you had taken something.' The court heard that Cogley would now lose his job as a delivery driver.","Aaron Cogley, from Portishead, Bristol, was stopped after running red lights and swerving between lanes .

Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult deals with a school shooting and has themes of bullying and sexual content . A two-minute time limit for speaking . was imposed on those attending the meeting and when Mr Baer exceeded . this, during a strident outburst, he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Immediately after his arrest his . daughter, Marina, 14, railed against the school authorities. She told . them: ‘This just shows that you resort to force at the first turn of . conflict. And I'm appalled. I don't trust you and I honestly don't feel . safe around you people.’ Footage of the drama was quickly uploaded to the internet.

ff885f08387febf39f5a29c56b6a04bd4b94117b,"India is to send its last ever telegram this weekend, bringing to an end a 162-year-old service originally set up in the heyday of the British Raj. With one final STOP at the end, the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), India’s state-run telegram service, will wire its final message to an as yet unknown location on Sunday. The service, the last of its type in the world, still sends around 5,000 telegrams a day and employs 998 people in its 75 offices. All stop: A worker taps out a telegram at the Central Telegraph Office in New Delhi. India disbanded the world's last major telegram service on Sunday . Final posts: An Indian telegram messenger holds up some of the last messages to go out at the Central Telegraph Office in New Delhi . But that is a far cry from its peak in 1985 when it was relaying some 60 million messages every year and employing 12,000 people. Today the remaining customers consist mainly of local government offices sending administrative messages to remote areas which are still not covered by the phone networks. Back in the days of the British Raj, the telegram service proved an absolutely vital means of control for a colonial power ruling over a vast expanse of land. The first 27-mile stretch of line was laid by the East India Company between Calcutta and Diamond Harbour as early as 1851. To . cope with India's stifling heat and humidity, the cables used were far . thicker than those in Europe and North America and were covered with a . layer of cloth and pitch to keep out the dust and monsoon rains. Origins: A team of workers lays the underwater cable that stretched from India to Britain in 1870 . Mechanics: A museum employee in Bhopal with an 1837 telegraphy machine of the type used in the early years . The network grew exponentially. One of the most famous early messages was . sent to Lord Dalhousie in Calcutta in April 1852 announcing the fall of . Rangoon during the during the second Anglo-Burmese war. And when Indian troops rebelled in . 1857, sparking a widespread uprising against colonial rule, the telegram . is credited with playing a crucial role in helping the British mobilise . and regain control. After the uprising was quelled, Lord Dalhousie famously credited the telegram as having 'saved India for the British Empire'. BK . Syngal, former Managing director of VSNL, which had a mandate to send . telegrams overseas until 2002, told the Hindustan Times: 'The telegraph . allowed the British to relay information across large parts of India in . almost real time. Communication: Mahatma Gandhi, who led the struggle for Indian independence, relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds . 'This leap in communications proved decisive'. In 1870, underwater cables were laid between India and Britain providing a vital link between Westminster and Britain's largest and most valuable colony. But like many innovations introduced by the British, the telegram was quickly adopted by Indians for their own use. Mahatma Gandhi, who led the struggle for Indian independence, relied heavily on telegrams to rally support and appeal for vital funds. And during the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, the telegram would prove a vital link between families and friends at opposite ends of the country. Santosh Sharma, who sixty-six years ago left Pakistan for New Delhi, remembers how she then used telegrams to keep in touch with her loved ones. 'Crossing the border meant risking your own life,' she told AFP, 'At that time the telegram was the only way to keep families informed, give speedy updates and reunite.' Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru also relied on the telegram famously sending British Prime Minister Clement Attlee a message to request help from London when Pakistani troops invaded Kashmir. R.K. Rai, a retired telegraph operator in . New Delhi, remembers the service in its pomp as hundreds of workers . crashed out the dots and dashes of Morse Code used on telegraph . machines. He told AFP: 'The whole office sounded like a factory,' he remembers. 'Sometimes we felt we knew every significant detail of our customer's lives. 'The word privacy did not exist in anyone's dictionary then.' The service continued to be invaluable up until the 1990s with the advent of mobile communications. Today Raj's old office, a colonial style building in the centre of capital barely sends out 10 messages a day and will soon be closed. He added: 'The new technology is so fast it just surprises me. Communication is a game of speed, the fastest will always win the game. 'Eventually the telegraph system had to face defeat.'","India's state-run BSNL network is the world's last major telegram service .

ff89646f30872d538d626ccb91ce36ef16a59050,"(CNN) -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began explosions Monday night at the Birds Point-New Madrid levee at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The explosions, near the southern border between Missouri and Illinois, marked the start of a three-stage process to intentionally breach the levee -- and, in the process, pave the way for tons of water to flood 130,000 acres of Missouri farmland -- to alleviate pressure caused by historically high water levels in the rivers. At 5 p.m. Monday, the water level outside Cairo, Illinois, was 61.44 feet -- well above the flood stage of 40 feet -- according to the National Weather Service. Maj. Gen. Michael Walsh ordered the intentional breach. ""(The system) continues to be under enormous and unprecedented pressure,"" said Walsh, the president of the Mississippi River Commission. ""Because of that ... I've ordered the district commander to operate the project."" Walsh said that historic and still-rising flood waters made it imperative to begin the explosive operation as soon as possible. The multistage process is expected to continue through Tuesday. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster's office tried to block the move, challenging the Corps' authority to breach the levee. But the U.S. Supreme Court, in a ruling from Justice Samuel Alito, denied Missouri's bid. On Monday, Gov. Jay Nixon issued a statement saying he had talked with Walsh about the attempt ""to relieve pressure on other parts of the levee system and save lives."" He said Missouri authorities are ready for the blast and subsequent flood. ""I urge Missourians to continue to cooperate fully with state, county and local law enforcement, as they have at every stage of this process,"" Nixon said. ""Together, we will ensure that Missouri families stay safe in the coming days. And together, we will recover and rebuild."" Without an intentional breach, authorities had warned of massive flooding that could wipe out Cairo. Already, Cairo's mayor ordered the city's 2,800 residents to evacuate. Walsh acknowledged the human dimension of his plan, which has irked many in Missouri, where hundreds more have been evacuated. Nixon has estimated that it will take tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars to recover property and rebuild lives as the water rushes through the floodway, including washing out farmland he described as ""literally the most productive part of our continent."" ""It's a heart-wrenching story,"" Walsh said. ""It takes a long time to recover from something like this."" He said the fate of Cairo was just one of many factors in his decision, saying he hoped the move would alleviate issues throughout the Mississippi River system. Water levels and flooding have hit record highs in many spots, putting severe strains on systems meant to prevent uncontrolled floods and the resulting loss of life and property. With rain continuing to fall and water levels continuing to rise, Walsh said the situation would only get worse without drastic action. ""Nobody has seen this type of water in the system,"" he said. ""This is unprecedented."" And he did not rule out similar moves elsewhere, including possibly more purposeful explosions at other levees along the Mississippi and its tributaries. The area, in Missouri's so-called ""Bootheel,"" is one of four floodways along the system that could be opened up. Walsh said he expected the Birds Point-New Madrid levee breach will cause river crests to drop three to four feet ""for a few days,"" even as he voiced concerns that water levels could very well rise again. ""This doesn't end this historic flood,"" said Walsh. ""This is not going to be over when we operate this.""","NEW: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers begins intentionally breaching the levee .

A convicted murderer who killed a pensioner in 1994 will be detained indefinitely in a secure mental hospital after a cold case probe found him responsible for killing two others in the same year. Robin Ligus, who was jailed for life for killing Robert Young in 1994, was told he will only return to prison to resume his original sentence if he is ever deemed 'fit and safe' to be freed from the specialist unit. The 59-year-old former painter and decorator, from Shrewsbury, was found responsible for the unlawful killings of both Trevor Bradley and Brian Coles by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court in July. The month-long trial heard that Ligus, who was desperate for money to buy drugs, killed Mr Bradley near Melverley in April 1994 by knocking him out and setting his car alight. Jurors also ruled Ligus committed the unlawful killing of Mr Coles, who was bludgeoned to death with an iron bar at his home near Whitchurch, Shropshire, in October 1994. But he was acquitted of involvement in the death of Bernard Czyzewska, whose body was found in the River Severn in Shrewsbury a month after Mr Coles’ murder. The serial killer, who watched today's proceedings via a videolink to HMP Woodhill in Buckinghamshire, was originally jailed for life in 1996 after admitting the November 1994 murder of Shrewsbury pensioner Robert Young. Victims: Robert Ligus was found not to have been responsible for the death of Bernard Czyzewska, left, but responsible for the death of Trevor Bradley, right . Victim: Brian Coles was one of three men found dead in 1994 . Ordering Ligus to be detained under the . Criminal Procedure Insanity Act for the unlawful killing of Mr Coles and . Mr Bradley, Mr Justice Treacy noted that both offences took place many . years ago. The judge told the court: 'They took . place in circumstances of considerable violence in the context of crimes . committed for gain... in the same timeframe as the brutal murder of . Robert Young. 'That sequence of events reveals a highly dangerous individual.' Ligus will be moved to a secure psychiatric hospital in Northampton within the next 28 days. West Mercia Police charged the father-of-three with the murders of Mr Bradley, Mr Coles and Mr Czyzewska in September last year after a cold case review into their deaths. Unusually, the defendant, who uses a wheelchair, was present in the dock for only one day of his trial, having been judged mentally unfit to take part in the proceedings. Because of Ligus's mental state, jurors were instructed to rule on whether he did the acts alleged against him, rather than being required to return verdicts of guilty or not guilty.","Court rules Robin Ligus to be held in a secure mental hospital indefinitely .

ff8a32be16120500b9011b5c5af14a84d4639963,"Mitt Romney has made millions of dollars through a tax loophole in the Netherlands, it was claimed today. The Republican presidential candidate received the money through his continued involvement with Bain Capital, the private-equity company he established in 1994 before launching his political career. Mr Romney received a severance deal when he departed the firm in 1999 that paid him in capital gains tax rather than a salary, according to a report by the website Follow The Money and Dutch newspaper de Volkskrant. This means that the GOP candidate would have to pay significantly less tax. Thumbs up: Mitt Romney greets supporters while boarding his campaign plane after a rally at Orlando Sanford international airport in Florida today. It was today claimed that he has made millions of dollars through a tax loophole in the Netherlands . It has also emerged that Mr Romney and his wife Ann were allowed to continue investing in Bain until at least 2009 and were still receiving tax-free income in 2010 and 2011. The Netherlands connection is complicated but boils down to the country offering huge tax breaks to multi-national firms such as Bain, which is reported to have avoided $100million (80million euros) in dividend taxes there. Bain managed this by, in 2004, investing in the Irish pharmaceutical company Warner Chilcott. At the time it was registered in Bermuda, but it moved to Ireland five years later after Barack Obama's administration cracked down on the island's tax breaks. In 2010, Bain moved its interest in Warner Chilcott to Dutch firm Alter Domus, which provides administrative services for multi-national companies. If a Dutch company owns more than 5 per cent of the shares in another firm, then that firm is exempt from paying capital gains tax. The report claims that there is a discrepancy between Mr Romney's tax filings in the U.S. and the tax-exempt shares worth $450,000 that he donated to his son's charity the Tyler Foundation in 2011. Big business: Mr Romney received a severance deal when he departed Bain Capital in 1999 that paid him in capital gains tax rather than a salary, it is alleged . The investigators came to their conclusions by studying Bain's tax returns, Mr Romney's own tax filings and Dutch Chamber Of Commerce documents. According to an investigation by Bloomberg News published last month, Mr Romney has benefited from a now-outlawed loophole that enables him to use the tax-exempt status of the Mormon church to reduce his own tax bill. Then the chief executive officer of Bain Capital, he set up the arrangement in June 1996, the year before Congress clamped down on the practice. As someone whose arrangements were already established, he was allowed to keep them in place. Called a charitable remainder unitrust, it is one of several strategies Mr Romney has adopted to reduce his tax bill. Such tax avoidance is legal and common among very rich people but it has been turned into an issue by the Obama campaign. In the second presidential debate, President Barack Obama slammed Mr Romney for paying 'lower tax rates than somebody who makes a lot less'. In this case, Mr Romney used the tax-exempt status of Mormon Church to defer taxes for more than 15 years. While Mr Romney will benefit, the trust will probably leave the church with less than what the law now requires, according to tax returns obtained by Bloomberg this month through a Freedom of Information Act request. Charities don’t usually owe capital gains taxes when they sell assets for a profit and trusts like Mr Romney’s permit funders to benefit from that tax-free treatment. Mr Romney has donated tens of millions of dollars to charities, principally the Mormon church.","GOP candidate receives the money through his involvement with Bain Capital, the private-equity company he established in 1994 and left in 1999 ."

ff8af5815c2b95f9e399751243781beb8a230b1c,"Sometimes it takes a disaster to inspire innovation. There is a major drought in California. It's not the first state to face a water shortage recently, and it's definitely not the first time California has had to battle drought, but it could drag on for a decade and have a significant impact on all Americans who rely on California farms for food. Residents, the government and the agriculture industry are hoping for some high-tech solutions for a very old problem. Surprisingly, given its California location, Silicon Valley isn't a hotbed of drought and water research. Most local investors and venture capitalists aren't looking to invest in something that will take at least 10 years to pay off. They want software, cheap-to-make mobile apps that gather and monetize data about people, and consumer goods like phones, smart watches and futuristic thermostats. ""Water doesn't always fit the venture capital model,"" said Scott Bryan, COO of Imagine H2O, a San Francisco nonprofit focused on helping water-technology companies get their ideas off the ground. As the United Nations observes World Water Day on Saturday, it's fitting that the biggest water research and innovation hubs are scattered around the globe. Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Israel are global leaders in the industry out of geographic necessity. In the United States, there are water-research centers clustered in Fresno and San Diego in California, and in Fort Collins, Colorado, Boston and Milwaukee. In Milwaukee, the roots of the water industry go back 100 years and are tied to the city's big breweries. Now there are 150 water-tech companies in the region, and five of the 11 largest companies in the world either have their headquarters or a major operation there. Green roofs and tree trays . Dean Amhaus runs The Water Council, which has created the Global Water Center, a Milwaukee complex with almost 100,000 square feet of research space, labs, offices and conference rooms. Researchers and entrepreneurs come together to collaborate on water-technology issues. The space houses intriguing startups such as Hanging Gardens, which builds ""green"" roofs that help collect storm water. There also are products that help detect leaks, waste-water treatment research, and tools for better tracking water usage and waste. Agriculture accounts for 70% of all our water usage, so much of the current technology focuses on helping farms use water more efficiently. Solutions range from the high-tech, like using big data and infrared aerial monitoring to give farmers more precise water information, to the simpler but ingenious, such as specialized plastic trays that fit around the bases of young trees. Imagine H2O's latest class has a crop of promising agriculture technology companies. WatrHub wants to be the Bloomberg Terminal of agriculture. The Toronto-based company was founded by a former Microsoft employee and a former Apple employee. They're using their experience working with big data sets to scrape together all the available information that might be useful to water and wastewater systems in North America. Getting better information is also what inspired the two founders of WellIntel. They have invented a monitor that gathers real-time data from water wells using sonar. Farms or rural homes with wells on their property can choose to keep their information private or share it anonymously with WellIntel, which uses the data to help government agencies and others see the bigger picture of water shortages. Then there's the plastic tray, the brainchild of an Israeli company called Tal-Ya which claims it can reduce water consumption by up to 50 percent. The lightweight square funnels rainwater or irrigation water toward the base of a tree and blocks sunlight, which kills weeds. It also captures any evaporating soil moisture, condensing it and trickling it back to the roots. As a bonus, the reflective surface redirects light back to the plant to aid in light absorption. All the companies have seen a recent uptick in interest in their products. ""Everybody for the most part has been tuned out on water (shortages) because within the U.S. it's not really been a big issue,"" said Amhaus. ""The situation in California has raised huge attention to the fact that we actually do have a problem."" 'Forcing innovation' Companies and industrial farmers have financial incentives to test new water-saving technologies. But convincing regular consumers to change their ways is trickier. One part of public awareness means doling out practical advice on how to save water at home, such as only watering lawns at night, not running the dishwasher until it's completely full, and taking shorter showers. Oftentimes, people won't be spurred to action without some sort of incentive, or at least evidence that a lack of water has a negative impact on their lives. Eventually, the fruits and vegetables people expect to get in grocery stores won't be there, or they'll be much more expensive because they're imported from other countries. Saving money on water bills isn't going to be a big motivator, according to Amhaus. ""Right now water has been cheap and it will continue to be cheap,"" he said. ""It's not the price, it's whether its even going to be available."" Christian Siems sells equipment to farms and vineyards and works with Tal-Ya. He sees first hand the steps the agriculture industry is taking to combat a looming water shortage. The drought has inspired many companies to test out new solutions.

This incident has shown me people are amazing and in moments of true chaos - the impossible can happen.' Having seen her photographed as one of dozens of stunned and shocked survivors outside the mall following the shooting, Dang's father spoke to media outside his home to update them on his daughter's progress. Steven Dang told 10News he believes his daughter Elaine Dang suffered injuries to her chest, arm and leg. 'The chest … something metal came in her chest and then the arm and the leg,' he said.

According to a LinkedIn profile in her name, she went on to UC Berkeley and then taught underperforming kids through Teach for America. Asked what his emotions were when he first heard of his daughter being at the attack he said, 'I cried and then I'm afraid....Scary, but I'm happy right now...she do OK.' This comes as Mohammed Ali, Chief Investigations Editor at KTN, tweeted a picture of people that may be the attackers. It is CCTV footage of two men, carrying guns. They are not in army fatigues. If indeed it is the terrorists, it is one of the first images of the deadly attack and carries haunting echoes of the terror attack carried out in Mumbai in 2008, which left over 160 dead and injured more than 600 people.

Lord Tebbit suggested sales of junk food would be higher in areas where food banks are most popular . People use food banks to get basic items free and spend their remaining cash on junk food, Lord Tebbit claimed yesterday. The former Cabinet minister said there was a ‘near infinite demand’ for anything free. The Tory peer was speaking in a House of Lords debate about food banks – which Labour claim are booming because Coalition austerity policies leave many people unable to make ends meet. But Lord Tebbit suggested more people were using them because the number of banks has increased and they would prefer not to pay for food. It follows research showing the number of families claiming they are going hungry has fallen over the past five years – as the number of food banks has risen. The peer said: ‘There is always a near infinite demand for valuable goods that are given away free. ‘One can even notice it in the catering departments of this building. If food is given away at prices grossly below the markets more is used.’ He invited environment minister Lord de Mauley to ‘initiate some research into the sales of junk food in areas where  people are living for their basic food on the food banks’. The minister declined. Earlier this month Tory welfare minister Lord Freud said the demand for food banks was difficult to understand. ‘Clearly nobody goes to a food bank willingly,’ he added. ‘However, it is very hard to know why people go to them.’ The intervention came after a series of peers in the House of Lords had called on the Government to tackle the scale of food bank usage in the UK. Lord Palmer, an independent crossbench peer, said it was a ‘scandal in today’s society that food banks have to exist at all’. Labour peers’ leader Baroness Royall . of Blaisdon said food banks in the South West gave aid to more than . 40,000 adults and 20,000 children last year. She . described it as down to ‘desperate pressing demand due to a cost of . living crisis’ and called for Lord de Mauley to visit one. Lord de Mauley said he had visited a food bank and they were run by ‘wonderful people and donated to by hugely generous folk’. The Government has repeatedly questioned whether food banks are responding to growing need . ‘They perform a very valuable service distributing food to people who really need it and they tend to operate at a local level,’ he said. ‘Britain has a great tradition of charitable giving and I think it would be a bad day when we started to interfere with that.’ Only 8.1 per cent of Britons admitted to being unable to afford food in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 . Last . year Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked outrage when he . claimed families become so poor they are forced to turn to food banks . because of their own ‘decisions’. He suggested that many cash-strapped families have brought their problems on themselves.He added: ‘I appreciate that there are families who face considerable pressures. ‘Those . pressures are often the result of decisions that they have taken which . mean they are not best able to manage their finances. ‘We need to ensure that support is not just financial, and that the right decisions are made.’ A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found Britons were among the least likely in the developed world to say there were times when they could not afford food, an international report found. Only 8.1 per cent reported this in 2012, down from 9.8 per cent in 2007 – before the economic crisis and when Labour was in power. The study, which represents industrialised nations, flies in the face of Left-wing claims that cuts in public spending are leaving thousands of families going hungry. The number of food banks has increased over the past few years, with charities claiming that more than half a million people across the country have visited them. It emerged this month that more than a third of councils are subsidising food banks at a cost of £3million to the taxpayer. While most town halls paid for support such as management and administration, some were even paying for the food.","Former Tory minister says there is a 'near infinite demand' for anything free .

An electronic voting machine in Pennsylvania has been removed from service after it changed votes for President Obama into those for Mitt Romney. An 18-second clip posted onto YouTube shows a voter's finger repeatedly pressing the button for Obama, but the check mark instead comes up next to Romney's name. This is the latest in a flurry of voting glitches across the country today from West Palm Beach in Florida where ballot counting machines broke down, to vast swathes of New Jersey where text alert systems for residents sent them to the wrong polling stations. Scroll Down for Video . The YouTube video clearly shows the voter's finger touching the screen to vote for Barack Obama (left) but lighting up for Mitt Romney instead (right) In comments attached to the clip, . the anonymous user named 'centralpavote' said that 'all the other . buttons worked fine' and asked voters either side if they were . experiencing similar problems - which they denied. NBC News has reported that since the clip was posted to Reddit this morning, it spread across the Internet and the offending machine has been retired from service. The video which was filmed on the YouTube users Android phone shows the potentially serious malfunction affect only a vote for the incumbent president. A vote for any other of the candidates for the presidency and vice presidency resulted in a successful choice - it was only a vote for President Obama that caused the machine to change to Mitt Romney. 'I initially selected Obama but Romney was highlighted,' said 'centralpavote' on the introduction to his video on YouTube. Christie Tipton casts her ballot using an electronic voting machine similar to the one in Pennsylvania that refused to cast a vote for Barack Obama . A school in Philadelphia has been asked to cover up a mural of Barack Obama that was on display in front of voters today . They were criticised for only using three pieces of paper to cover the mural - leading to accusations of bias from Republicans . 'I assumed it was being picky so I deselected Romney and tried Obama again, this time more carefully, and still got Romney. 'Being a software developer, I immediately went into troubleshoot mode. 'I first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting Jill Stein to actually highlight Obama. Nope. Jill Stein was selected just fine. 'Next I deselected her and started at the top of Romney’s name and started tapping very closely together to find the ‘active areas’. 'From the top of Romney’s button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama’s name was all active for Romney. 'From the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the Obama button (basically a small white sliver) is what let me choose Obama. 'Stein’s button was fine. All other buttons worked fine.' The voter reported the problem to an electoral official who declared it a non issue. 'I then called over a volunteer to have a look at it,' said 'centralpavote'/ . 'She . him hawed (sic) for a bit then calmly said 'It’s nothing to worry . about, everything will be OK.' and went back to what she was doing. 'I then recorded this video.' However, . far from evidence of electoral fraud, experts have weighed in with the . theory that this is a calibration problem specific to the machine. 'It's a concern but not because of . fraud... that's an obviously miscalibrated iVotronic (ES&S) voting . machine,' said Jospeh Lorenzo Hall, Senior Staff Technologist at the . Center for Democracy & Technology to Gawker. 'We would recommend that poll workers would recalibrate the machine and everything would be fine. Bob Warhola casts his vote at a polling place inside a residential garage, Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2012, in Forest City, Pennsylvania . 'Also, with some models of voting system if you place a thumb on accident while resting on the machine it can 'bias' the calibration of the touchscreen up towards the errant thumb. 'That could be happening to, if it's only for this one voter.' Further controversy over voting . continued at a polling place in a Philadelphia school where workers . ignored a judge's order to cover a mural of President Obama 'in its . entirety'. The art work . which is positioned behind voting machines contains the words 'change!' and 'hope' together with a quote from the president and a painting of . him. However, electoral . poll workers only covered up the mural with three pieces of paper - . leaving the Obama logo and quote from the serving president in full view . of all prospective voters. Seeing an attempt to influence the votes of those attending the polling place in Ward 35, Republicans were outraged. A poll worker assists a voter with the voting booth curtain before voting during the U.S. presidential election at the Penrose recreation center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania today . 'It . is an absolute disgrace,' said Shannon Royer, deputy secretary for . external affairs and elections in Pennsylvania to Fox News. 'Election . materials and electioneering inside the polling place are prohibited by . state law. This can be interpreted as trying to influence voters inside . the polling place. 'I am told discussions are going on now about covering the mural.' However, even though the voting machine whistle-blower . has kept their anonymity, other better known individuals are unwittingly . breaking the law by posting pictures from the ballot box online. Talk show host Sean Hannity didn't surprise anyone with the contents of his ballot when he tweeted a photo of it. What may be a surprise is that very act appeared to break the law. The ballot that the Fox News Channel host tweeted showed him voting for Mitt Romney on the Conservative Party line, and continuing to vote for Conservatives across the undercard. Yet New York State law says that it's illegal for someone to reveal the contents of a prepared ballot, perhaps a pre-social media era statute designed to guard against voter intimidation. It's a misdemeanor that would be up to a district attorney to prosecute, said John Conklin, spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections. Fox News host Sean Hannity apparently tweeted pictures of his ballot today. This may be a misdemeanor under New York State elections law which prohibits voters from showing a ballot after it is prepared for voting . Voters cast their votes using electronic voting machines during the U.S. presidential election at a voting location in Valley City, Ohio today . The idea of showing off a completed ballot on Twitter, Instagram or some other social media site wasn't considered by the Founding Fathers. But it was a hot topic for discussion online early Tuesday, and the website gizmodo.com published a guide of how individual state laws might affect such an act. In fact according to new data from Pew Research 22 percent of registered voters in the United States have indicated on Facebook or Twitter who they voted for today. However, the question of whether using your smartphone to photograph your ballot is illegal depends entirely on the state in which you are voting. Some states such as Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada and Texas, 'expressly prohibit the use of photographic and recording equipment inside polling places.' The state of Wisconsin is cracking down hard on those who post completed ballot pics to Facebook or Twitter - explaining that it constitutes election fraud under that state's law and is a Class I felony.

The Spurs, overriding favourites to defend their crown having won it in such a convincing manner last term, needed a late three-pointer from Tony Parker - who scored 23 points in total - to clinch victory. Before tip-off, San Antonio staff and players were presented with their championship rings. The inscription inside the ring was 'Good to Great', which was coach Gregg Popovich's mantra last season.

The Spurs were imperious throughout the regular season last time around, boasting a sensational win-loss record of 62-20. The franchise took this form into the play-offs which culminated in their 4-1 thrashing in the best-of-seven NBA Finals series against the Miami Heat. In coach Gregg Popovich they have someone who understands when to utilise his squad and how to maximise their talents too. Criticisms of Spurs in the past have been that they are an ageing side - but the experience of Parker, Tim Duncan, Parker and Manu Ginobli is brilliantly off-set by Kawhi Leonard. The 23-year-old was the Finals' MVP last season and his qualities on both side of the floor will be a key component to a cohesive Spurs side. Ginobili (right) is experienced and impressed against the Mavericks in San Antonio on Tuesday . Before tip-off the San Antonio Spurs unveiled their latest championship banner . Spurs' likely threats in the West are likely to come from the Oklahoma City Thunder, Los Angeles Clippers and the Golden State Warriors. The Houston Rockets - who travelled to the Staples Centre to face the LA Lakers on Tuesday - are likely to struggle following the departures of two starters in Jeremy Lin and Chandler Parsons. Over in the East, the Conference is shaping up to be one of the most hotly-contested in years. LeBron James' (right) move back to the Cleveland Cavaliers has made them strong contenders out in the East . All of the pre-season focus has been on LeBron James' move back to the Cleveland Cavaliers from the Miami Heat. The four-time MVP won successive NBA titles with Miami, in 2012 and 2013, as he formed an unbelievable trio with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. James' return to the Cavs immediately makes them a dangerous franchise to be reckoned with. In Kyrie Irving they have a star in the making alongside James, and the acquisition of Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves only makes them stronger. However, the pressure on Cleveland to deliver so soon is a season premature considering they finished outside the play-off spots last year. Miami Heat will be relying heavily on the talents of Chris Bosh (left) following James' departure . For the Heat, despite the loss of James coach Erik Spoelstra's can still rely on the talents of Bosh and Wade. Miami have contested the last four NBA Finals series and the experience within their squad should see them come at least close to matching that feat again. The additions of Danny Granger and Britain’s Luol Deng means success should continue to roll at the American Airlines Arena. Arguably the team that both the Heat and Cleveland will be most wary of is the Chicago Bulls. Derrick Rose's (left) from two serious knee injuries and the signing of Pau Gasol (left of second picture) make the Chicago Bulls strong contenders for the Eastern Conference title this season . The Bulls finished fourth in the East last season but have been strongly tipped to go all the way in the Conference this campaign. In centre Joakim Noah, they have the current defensive player of the year - and his tough-to-beat traits reflect that of coach Tom Thibodeau’s mindset. The signing of Pau Gasol adds some much needed offense but it is the return of Derrick Rose from injury that has increased expectations at the United Center. After suffering two serious knee injuries the 2011 MVP looks fit once more and ready to lead Chicago back to their Michael Jordan-inspired dominance in the 1990s.

ff8dbf71a05c826e6931aec0a21a97d3fbed5d6d,"A U.S. senator warned on Thursday that ISIS, the militant terror group sweeping across Iraq, aims to destroy an American population center and is working on a plan to do it. 'They're crazy out there and they're rapidly developing a method of blowing up a major U.S. city and people just can't believe that's happening,' Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe told the Fox-25 television in Oklahoma City. Inhofe, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned that leaders of ISIS 'are really bad terrorists. They're so bad even al-Qaeda is afraid of them.' Rep. Jim Bridenstine, a fellow Oklahoma Republican and a committee member, told the Tulsa World that ISIS Islamists are 'cutting children's bodies in half. They're shooting them. I've never seen anything like it.' Scroll down for video . The Oklahoma senator warned that the US faces a novel and potentially catastrophic threat from ISIS, and said President Barack Obama isn't up to the task of defeating the terror group . The warnings came after a stomach-churning video released Tuesday showed the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley at the hands of an ISIS militant, and on the heels of a press briefing where Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the U.S. military's job is to 'get ready' for whatever battle might lie ahead. ISIS is 'as sophisticated and well-funded as any group that we have seen,' Hagel said, appearing alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey. 'They're beyond just a terrorist group,' Hagel said. 'They marry ideology and a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well funded. ...This is beyond anything we've seen, so we must prepare for everything.' 'It's a long-term threat,' he conceded under questioning from reporters, adding moments later that 'the president has been very clear on mission creep. And he's made it very clear that he will not allow that.' Gen. Dempsey warned that America's involvement in Iraq will continue for years to come, citing the intensity of hatred among ethnic, religious and tribal groups there. 'The conflict against those groups – most of which are local, some of which are regional, and some of which are global in nature – that's going to be a very long contest,' he said. Rep. Jim Bridenstine said if America is going to do battle with ISIS, 'we have to win' 'It's ideological. It's not political. It's religious in many cases. So, yes, it's going to be a very long contest.' Bridenstine said hours later that 'if we're going to do these kinds of operations, we have to win.' But a frustrated Inhofe said Thursday night that he fears President Obama isn't up to the task, despite the tough words he delivered Wednesday before hitting the golf course. 'Obama's lofty rhetoric is undermined by fainthearted follow-through and lack of meaningful action,' he told the World. 'The president's limited strikes in Iraq have not halted ISIS' momentum but only temporarily redirected it,' said Inhofe. 'Without sustained pressure, ISIS will regroup and continue its campaign of terror.' 'We're in the most dangerous position we've ever been in as a nation,' he told Fox-25. A top Marine general agreed on Wednesday, writing on the DefenseOne website that if the U.S. military doesn't 'eradicate' ISIS now more attacks on the West will come. General John Allen praised Obama for the ordering airstrikes on ISIS camps in northern Iraq, but he urged him to 'move quickly to pressure the organisations entire ""nervous system,"" break it up, and destroy its pieces.' 'The U.S. is now firmly in the game and remains the only nation on the planet capable of exerting the kind of strategic leadership, influence and strike capacity to deal with IS[IS],' he wrote. 'It is also the only power capable of organizing a coalition's reaction to this regional and international threat.' ‘This group,' he wrote, 'is not a flash in the pan that will go away of its own accord or if we don’t poke at it.' General Allen praised Obama for recent airstrikes, but urged him to 'move quickly to pressure the organisations entire ""nervous system""' Allen also denied that the U.S. military was war weary, saying it's fully capable of attacking and reducing ISIS. ‘We should do it now, but supported substantially by our traditional allies and partners, especially by those in the region who have the most to give – and the most to lose – if the Islamic State’s march continues.' ‘If we delay now, we will pay later.' The president told a global audience this week from his Martha's Vineyard vacation spot that the U.S. 'will continue to do what we must do to protect our people.' 'We will be vigilant and we will be relentless. When people harm Americans, anywhere, we do what's necessary to see that justice is done.' 'We act against ISIL, standing alongside others,' Obama added, hinting at his 'coalition' strategy rather than a plan to strike unilaterally with overwhelming American force. Inhofe, though, warned that without a concrete plan, Obama's words ring hollow. 'Relentless': Obama drew fire this week for golfing as an angry nation mourned the death of journalist James Foley at the hands of an ISIS militant . The video, uploaded to jihadi websites on Tuesday, shows the beginning of Foley's decapitation – and then his severed head resting on top of his prone body . 'You have to come up with something that we're going to do,' the senator said, 'because they're holding another hostage in place.' 'And the problem is, the president, quite frankly – he says all these things and he never does them.' With the right strategy, he added, the U.S. could defeat ISIS on its home turf before the threat arrives on America's doorstep. 'This idea that they're coming and infiltrating the United States – sure, some are coming in who have had an association with ISIS. But the majority of them are still over there,' he said. The senator also defended the United States government's sweeping intelligence programs that have drawn barbs from civil libertarians, suggesting that information dragnets would play a part in keeping ISIS at bay. 'You have to have an intelligence process going on to stop attacks on America,' he said.","Oklahoma senator said Obama needs a plan to crush the terror group .

ff8e3c34c016c32fe522515f0d33d528f7b0683b,"(CNN) -- Tokyo faces the possibility of being hit by a massive earthquake within the next four years, according to Japanese researchers. The University of Tokyo's Earthquake Research Institute predicts there is a 70% probability that the capital's metropolitan area will experience a magnitude-7 quake within four years and a 98% probability within the next 30 years. Nearly one year ago, a magnitude 9.0 quake struck off Japan's central Pacific coast, triggering a devastating tsunami and aftershocks that left more than 15,700 dead, according to a government report in December on Japan's recovery from the catastrophe. About 4,500 were listed as missing. Nearly 700 aftershocks registering magnitude 5 or greater followed last year's quake, the government report said. The March 11 earthquake -- dubbed ""Tohoku"" after the region in which it occurred -- also damaged the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station, where three reactors experienced full meltdowns, creating a nuclear crisis for a country already grappling with disaster. The research institute cited for its findings the Gutenberg Richter Law, which states that an increase in small tremors will likely increase the number of larger earthquakes. According to another paper published in September, the institute concluded that the quake ruptured a fault area nearly 500 kilometers in length and 200 kilometers wide offshore. The fourth strongest quake recorded in history, Tohoku caused abrupt stress changes in the upper plate and triggered widespread seismic activity throughout the Japanese island. The northern part of Ibaraki Prefecture, in particular, saw a significant increase of shallow seismicity after the quake compared with the extremely low rate eight years prior, the researchers said. Should Tokyo's inhabitants be worried? The research institute's findings carry great consequences for the 42 million people who live in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The Central Disaster Management Council has estimated that a large-scale earthquake in the next few decades could result in 11,000 deaths and an economic loss of 112 trillion yen (US$1.5 trillion). Its goal is to halve the estimated death toll and reduce the estimated economic loss. How precise are seismic forecasts? Gary Gibson, a seismologist at Australia's Seismology Research Centre, called the Earthquake Research Institute's findings ""not at all unexpected,"" given the level of seismic activity and their model. ""Seismologists cannot predict with certainty when, where and how large the next big earthquake will be,"" he wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""However, it is possible to forecast the probability of an earthquake in a particular time range (e.g. the next four years), location area (e.g. the Tokyo region), and magnitude range (e.g. greater than magnitude 7.0). ""Long-term forecasts use average activity levels from all known past earthquakes, geological data from fault displacements, and data about plate movement and deformation from very precise GPS measurements and other methods to determine these probabilities."" What is the government saying? The government's Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion had put a 70% probability of a magnitude-7 quake in Kanto region, which encompasses Tokyo and Yokohama, within 30 years, based on long-term seismicity and hazard studies. Scientists have already dubbed as ""Tokai"" an expected 8.0 quake near Suruga Bay, where large quakes have historically struck every 100-150 years, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The last one, a magnitude-8.4 quake, occurred in 1854 -- nearly 160 years ago. According to Gibson, the seismologist, the enhanced seismicity in the area affected by the Tohoku quake may fall towards normal levels and could affect the research institute's findings. Results for the six-month period after the quake would become available after this coming March 11, the quake's anniversary, he noted. Why is Japan so prone to earthquakes? The Japanese archipelago and neighboring areas rest on or around four tectonic plates -- the Pacific, Philippine Sea, North American and Eurasian plates -- whose movements account for one of the most seismically active places on earth. Can Tokyo withstand a 7.0 quake? Gibson said that while the area is a very active one seismically, building standards are high, therefore reducing the damage caused by earthquakes. Buildings in Tokyo held up well in the face of the ""Tohoku"" quake. Reinforced concrete and anti-seismic systems in buildings are among features that have helped absorb shocks when earthquakes occur. Watch Tokyo's quake-proof communities . ""A magnitude 7.0 earthquake is very much smaller than the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake,"" he wrote. ""It would need 1,000 magnitude-7.0 earthquakes to release as much strain energy as the magnitude 9.0. The fault rupture size is tens of kilometers, rather than hundreds of kilometers, and the fault displacement two to three meters rather than 20 to 30 meters."" Serious damage could be limited, if it occurs offshore, he added. And the shallower the quake, such as within 10 kilometers of the surface, the more localized the damage. CNN's Junko Ogura contributed to this report.","Forty-two million people live in Tokyo metropolitan area .

Ian Frankland, 54, used an extended dog lead fitted on his bicycle to take his German shepherd Mali for a walk by the river. But he was stopped by police who claimed the dog caused a traffic tailback which could have had 'catastrophic consequences' when it wandered into the middle of the road while trotting behind him. Scroll down for video . Grandfather-of-five Ian Frankland, 54 has been left with a £3,000 legal bill after he was convicted of dangerous cycling at Blackburn magistrates' court . The incident occurred in June in Clitheroe, Lancashire when Mr Frankland had used the Trixie Biker Set he bought on Amazon to take five year old Mali to the river where he planned to take pictures of wildlife . Mr Frankland was pulled over by police when Mali trotted in to the middle of the road behind him . When a police constable told Mr Frankland to pull over on the road that varies in speed limit between 30mph and 50mph, he tried to ride off before pulling out a camcorder to start filming the officer, a court was told. Mr Frankland was then detained and placed in the back of a police van when he initially refused to give his personal details. He relented when he was told Mali would be placed in kennels. He was found guilty at Blackburn magistrates' court of dangerous cycling on a public road and failing to stop when directed by a police officer and failing to give his name and address. He was fined £260, with £340 costs. He now faces a bill of £2,000 for his own defence costs. The maximum fine for dangerous cycling under the Road Traffic Act 1988 is £2,500. Today, Mr Frankland, a mechanic, said: 'The whole thing is outrageous - I've been made to feel like a bank robber when as far as I'm concerned, I've done nothing wrong. I'm not allowed to cycle on pavements so I had to go on the road and as far as I could see the traffic flowed fine. 'I wasn't going at any break neck speed, vehicles were going past and I wasn't causing any obstruction. It's ridiculous that I'm now being branded a danger to the roads. 'There are so many on the internet and when researching them they are the safest way of riding a bike with a dog. 'Everyone recommends them even the veterinary practices because it's one of the best forms of exercise. This was ideal because it was quick release and it had an expanding lead. 'I'd used it 30 or 40 times myself and my wife mainly on country roads to get some exercise and him having a runabout. Now I'm warning other people not to use it after what's happened. In my eyes I've not broken the law.' Mr Frankland was spotted cycling on Mitton Road in Clitheroe with Mali behind him when he was pulled over . The 54-year-old said he did not believe he had committed a criminal offence when he cycled along the road .

The incident occurred in June in Clitheroe, Lancashire when Mr Frankland had used the Trixie Biker Set he bought on Amazon to take five year old Mali to the river where he planned to take pictures of wildlife. He added: 'We set off back and I wasn't holding anyone up on the road. There was nothing stuck behind me, it was 120 yards of straight road, there are no double white lines so anyone wishing to overtake me could have done. 'Traffic only stopped when the police officer pulled up in a van and told me to stop. He shouted stuck his head out of the window and said ""that's inappropriate."" 'I simply said I was on my way home. I dismounted but he came running down and grabbed me by the shirt and neck and pulled my bike and wanted my address. 'I got my camcorder out because I'd seen on BBC Breakfast that under no account did people need to give their details to a police officer if they hadn't committed an offence but he took me to the back of the van and threw the mountain bike into the hedge and was frisking me and patting me down. 'I said ""what do you think you are doing?"". He said he was searching me to make sure there was nothing that can harm me or him.' PC John Scorah told the court he was driving along Mitton Road (pictured) when he saw Mr Frankland cycling towards him . Mr Frankland said: 'For anyone to accuse me of being a bad dog owner it really disgusts me. I would give my own life before seeing my dog come to any harm' Mr Frankland said he was later kept in cells at Burnley Police station for three hours. He added: 'The prosecution kept saying if I pleaded to a lesser charge they would let the rest go and I'd have a £40 fine but my wife and I didn't think that is British justice. 'I kept saying I was was not guilty. I was literally being badgered into a situation where they wanted me to plead guilty to a lesser charge but that's not me. I can't live my life on a lie. 'My wife has told told me to sell the bike and everything with it because she is that disheartened. I'm feeling like I've been penalised for being a law abiding citizen and trying to be healthy and keeping my dog healthy. 'For anyone to accuse me of being a bad dog owner it really disgusts me. I would give my own life before seeing my dog come to any harm. 'I was very disappointed at the verdict. I thought we are meant to have the best justice system in the world. Even my own barrister said he had never come across this. I've driven motorbikes, wagons, motor homes and cars - why should I be victimised for something like this?' A court heard Mr Frankland was close to the kerb but his dog, Mali (pictured here as a puppy), was near to the central white line and there were a queue of cars behind him . In court PC John Scorah told the court he was driving along Mitton Road when he saw Mr Frankland cycling towards him. Mr Frankland was close to the kerb but his dog, Mali, was near to the central white line and there were a queue of cars behind him. PC Scorah said: 'I had never seen anything like it in 25 years of policing. I stopped and shouted out of my window for him to stop. 'There is no way a dog should be running or walking down the centre of the road, let alone tied to a bicycle. If there had been a reaction to a cat or a person or anything like that the consequences could have been catastrophic.' PC Scorah said he had to run after Frankland and take hold of his bike to make him stop. He said: 'He pulled out a camcorder and started filming me. I didn't want to arrest him and would probably have dealt with the whole matter with a caution if he had co-operated.' After the case Nick Lloyd, of The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: 'Riding with your dog may act as a visual distraction and has the potential to affect your balance. Even animals that are well-trained may be distracted.

Women choosing to delay starting their families until later in life mean the average age when giving birth has risen by four years since the 1970s. Experts said it was a sign of women opting to concentrate on their careers before settling down, while also a sign of ‘how seriously couples take the responsibility of having children in the 21st century’. Last year there were 698,512 births in England and Wales, down by 4.3 per cent since 2012. However, the average age of mothers rose to 30years, compared with 29.8 years in 2012. It is the first time the average age has surpassed the three-decade mark since records began in 1938. The Office for National Statistics said: 'The average age of mothers has been increasing since 1975, with increasing numbers of women delaying childbearing to later ages. 'This may be due to a number of factors such as increased participation in higher education, increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing importance of a career, the rising opportunity costs of childbearing, labour market uncertainty, housing factors and instability of partnerships.' Fertility decreased among all age groups last year, but the biggest fall was among women aged under 20 and 20-24, down by 13 per cent and 8.9 per cent respectively. The ONS added: ‘In most developed countries women have been increasingly delaying childbearing to later in life, which has resulted in increases in the mean age at first birth and rising fertility rates among older women. ‘Although fertility rates for women aged 40 and over have been rising fast, fertility among women in their forties is still considerably lower than for women in their thirties. Women aged 30-34 currently have the highest fertility of any age group.’ Ann Furedi, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: 'The average age of mothers in this country has hit 30 for the first time as many women are deciding to start their families later in life. UK mothers are now on average older than women elsewhere in the world when they have their first baby. 'There may be many reasons for this, including the time it takes to achieve educational and professional development, as well as financial security - and it may also be a reflection of how seriously couples take the responsibility of having children in the 21st century. 'We need to support women's choices to have children at the age that is right for them. We certainly need policies in place that enable women to better combine family and working life, and in particular ensure that younger mothers don't suffer setbacks. 'While pregnancy and birth in older women may present slightly different challenges for healthcare professionals, the answer is not to cajole women into having babies before they are ready but to ensure our family planning and maternity services are set up to cater for the changing needs and choices of women today.' Almost half of all babies (47 per cent) were born outside marriage, up from 41 per cent a decade ago. In 1938, when records began, just 4.2 per cent of babies had parents who had not tied the knot. The percentage of babies born in England and Wales to mothers from outside the UK also reached a record high, hitting 26.5 per cent compared with 25.9 per cent in 2012 and 11.7 per cent when these records were first collected in 1969.","98,512 births in England and Wales, down by 4.3 per cent since 2012 .

David Moyes and his Manchester United squad flew home from Germany to uncertain futures on Thursday as the Barclays Premier League champions faced up to a season that is effectively over with one month left. The United manager ducked out through a side door to avoid camera crews at Manchester airport as the official charter plane arrived home from Champions League disappointment in Munich.

Saving face: United's next game is against Moyes's former club Everton - who won at Old Trafford in December . As for United’s players, there are as many as 10 with genuine question marks over their future and midfielder Darren Fletcher warned last night that it is up to them to prove that they are worthy of being retained beyond this summer. Fletcher, whose own future is far from secure, said: ‘We now have five league games left with nothing really to play for. That is a unique experience for us and we are  disappointed and hurting, but we have to go into these games and we have to win them. ‘He (Moyes) will definitely look back . on this season and realise it was a disappointment, but I fully expect . there to be some signings.

Some United fans are wondering why the board seem to be tolerating a  season of such disappointment. However, there was no word from United on their current malaise on Thursday as chief executive Ed Woodward stayed in Germany to talk to Bayern Munich officials about a possible summer deal for midfielder Toni Kroos.

United gave Bayern a scare,  taking the lead through Evra. But the Germans seemed to possess a killer instinct United don’t have. ‘We need to rise to that standard, said Fletcher. ‘I don’t think we are as far behind as some people think.

One of the most iconic football stars of his generation, David Beckham is to retire at the end of the season to bring down the curtain on a glittering career. As well as winning over 100 caps for his England and lifting 19 trophies in two different continents, it was his ability to maximize the power of the ""Beckham brand"" that allowed the footballer to transcend his sport and appeal to a worldwide mass audience. Beckham's marriage to former Spice Girl and fashion designer, Victoria, probably helped as well. ""Brand Beckham is dead, long live Brand Beckham!"" sports business expert Simon Chadwick told CNN. ""Beckham's transition from athlete commodity to sporting statesman and entrepreneur is now complete."" This year, Beckham became the first ever sportsman from outside of China to be invited to become the ambassador for the sport in the country. He is estimated to be Britain's wealthiest sportsman, earning in excess of $46 million a year, according to France Football magazine. ""I wouldn't have achieved what I have done today without my family,"" said Beckham in a statement. ""I'm grateful for my parents' sacrifice, which made me realise my dreams. ""I owe everything to Victoria and the kids, who have given me the inspiration and support to play at the highest level for such a long period."" Beckham's decision to retire comes days after the 38-year-old won his latest title with French club Paris Saint-Germain. ""I'm thankful to PSG for giving me the opportunity to continue but I feel now is the right time to finish my career, playing at the highest level,"" added Beckham. The Englishman, who won the Champions League with Manchester United in 1999, also won league titles with Real Madrid and Los Angeles Galaxy before arriving in the French capital earlier this year after signing a short-term contract. ""If you had told me as a young boy I would have played for and won trophies with my boyhood club Manchester United, proudly captained and played for my country over one hundred times and lined up for some of the biggest clubs in the world, I would have told you it was a fantasy,"" said Beckham. ""I'm fortunate to have realized those dreams."" Despite playing for some of the world's top clubs, Beckham singled out captaining his country as one of his ""proudest achievements"". ""I knew every time I wore the Three Lions shirt, I was not only following in a long line of great players, I was also representing every fan that cared passionately about their country,"" said Beckham, who won 115 caps for England. ""I'm honoured to represent England both on and off the pitch. I want to thank all my team-mates, the great managers that I had the pleasure of learning from. ""I also want to thank the fans who have all supported me and given me the strength to succeed.'' Beckham had the chance to join PSG in January 2012, but opted to stay in the U.S., ending his American mission with his second MLS Cup title before announcing that he would not fulfill the second year of his contract extension. ""Nothing will ever completely replace playing the game I love, however I feel like I'm starting a new adventure and I'm genuinely excited about what lies ahead,"" said Beckham. ""I'm fortunate to have been given many opportunities throughout my career and now I feel it's my time to give back."" Many of Beckham's former teammates and managers spoke of the positive impact his professionalism had on the clubs he played for. ""He was a great teammate and a role model for young players,"" said LA Galaxy Bruce Arena. ""He had achieved so much, but wanted to keep on achieving."" But former PSG winger David Ginola told CNN that he had had a conversation with Beckham a few weeks ago when the Englishman confided he had begun to question his fitness to play at the highest level.

ff8f80168a504fba291195c0b2fe53ceffa46a2d,"BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (CNN)  -- Three hours before the game, the car park outside the rugby stadium in Bloemfontein, seems to be filled with more ""braais"" (barbecues) than cars. Black players such as Bryan Habana typify the new multiracial Springboks. It is a typical, even iconic, white South African scene. At first glance, off the field, it might appear that nothing has changed in South African rugby -- the sport that came to symbolize white domination -- since the days of Apartheid. Most of the spectators are white, Afrikaans and guzzling brandy and coke. On their ""braais,"" they are cooking the local favorite ""boerewors"" -- a distinctive local farmer's sausage. But appearances can be deceiving. On the field, history is being made. South African rugby has changed. And the game's most ardent fans -- in the heart of Afrikaner country -- don't seem to mind. Facing Wales, South Africa's rugby team -- the reigning world champions -- took to the field with a new black coach, Peter de Villiers, and seven black players out of a team of 15 --- the most black players ever. Fourteen years after democracy, it seems South Africa's messy post-Apartheid race relations are slowly being worked out on the sports field. ""This is a new era. It changes the face of rugby. Historically and politically it's always seen as a white preserve. But the appointment of Peter de Villiers is a huge change in terms of mind set,"" South African rugby president Oregan Hoskins told CNN. Is South African sport doing enough to tackle the legacy of Apartheid? Have your say . The man at the heart of this rugby revolution is easy to miss. Amid the thick necks and even thicker thighs of a Springbok training session, de Villiers is the short, slight man who seems to have perfected the art of disappearing into the crowd. In fact, the largest thing about him is his bushy moustache. It took us months to pin him down for an interview and he already has a reputation for dodging the media. I couldn't figure out if he was nervous or just deeply suspicious of the press. But when I met him, I realized he doesn't really care what people read or write about him. He's deeply religious. The whole interview is peppered with references to God or the Bible and he makes a point of saying that his life is certainly not going to be defined by him being the Springbok coach. That said, he admits that ""since my childhood I've wanted to be a Springbok. To be a part of the set-up. But politics didn't allow us."" He says he was a good player -- but as a colored man he was barred from the white rugby set-up. In fact, during Apartheid, black and whites were not allowed to play sport together or against each other. The races were separated in all spheres of life. Fourteen years since those days, has the sport managed to transform itself from white domination to a multi-racial institution? Yes, say the fans. White, Afrikaans and by now tanked up with brandy and coke, we could not find one person who resented the new black Springboks. One group of burly men who were braai-ing Springbok meat on kebabs, told us: ""It is our team, we have to support them -- Don't think it bothers anyone as long as we can see them win."" And that's probably the point. South Africans are a competitive hard-nosed bunch; they hate to see their side lose. So as long as the world champions are winning, the supporters will love them -- white or black. To complicate matters further, three of the Springbok's black players are Zimbabweans. Not South Africans. But nobody seems to mind the ""foreigners"" either.","In South Africa, rugby union was once symbolic of white domination .

The archive, which consists of around 220 drawings, blueprints, specifications, memoranda and letters, effectively tells the story of how it was developed during the crucial period in the early years of the war. A unique archive charting the wartime development of the jet engine by the pioneering engineer Sir Frank Whittle is expected to fetch up to £30,000 at auction next month. This sketch of how the engine would work (pictured) is among the papers for sale . It will be sold at Bonhams' sale of Books, Maps, Manuscripts and Historical Photographs in London on November 12, when experts expect it to fetch between £20,000 and £30,000. Bonhams specialist Matthew Haley said: 'This is one of the most important and complete archives on a technological development which has shaped all our lives. 'It is a fascinating insight into the often tortuous way in which an idea takes shape and progresses through trial and error against the backdrop of the misunderstandings and professional frustrations common to any project.' Sir Frank, a British RAF engineer air officer, is credited with single handedly inventing the turbojet engine - one of the major technological developments of the 20th century . The development of the jet engine influenced not only the course of World War Two but underpinned the huge expansion of commercial aviation in the post war period. It enabled planes to fly at high altitude and at speeds of over 500 miles per hour for the first time. A 2002 BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons ranked Sir Frank at number 42. The archive is contained in a 'special file,' which belonged to Henry Nathan Sporborg, who was senior director and chief engineer of British Thomson-Houston. The archive, which consists of around 220 drawings including this one, blueprints, specifications, memoranda and letters, effectively tells the story of how it was developed during the crucial period in the early years of the war . The company manufactured the engine for Frank Whittle and Power Jets Ltd, under contract from the Air Ministry, between January 1940 and June 1941. Sir Frank had been working on his idea of a jet engine since 1930 and with financial backing, had established the company, Power Jets Limited, to develop the idea further. He attracted no interest from the War Ministry, however, until the late 1930s when the combination of the threat of war and the technological advances which Whittle was able to demonstrate changed official minds. The development of the jet engine influenced not only the course of World War Two but underpinned the huge expansion of commercial aviation in the post war period. Pictured is a letter from the Ministry of Aircraft Production . By 1940 the Ministry was writing to Mr Sporborg emphasising the importance of the work. One extract from the papers that will be sold, said: 'I hope that if you are fully aware of the great importance that the Air Ministry attach to the development of this Whittle engine you will take all steps in your power to ensure that no unnecessary delay occurs in the completion of these engines and that you will do all in your power to assist Power Jets Limited in their work.' Sir Frank's genius lay in realising that propeller engines, with their hundreds of complicated working parts, were approaching the limit of their capacity. Another intricate drawing by Sir Frank Whittle showing the workings of the jet engine. His genius lay in realising that propeller engines were approaching the limit of their capacity. To enable planes to fly at speeds of over 500 miles per hour he proposed using a variant on the internal combustion engine with the hot gases used for propulsion . To enable planes to fly at high altitude . and at speeds of over 500 miles per hour he proposed using a variant on . the internal combustion engine, which directly heats the air by . combusting fuel, with the resultant hot gases used for propulsion. With far fewer components than propeller engines this also had the advantage of being much simpler to maintain. Sir Frank is reported to have said: 'Reciprocating engines are exhausted. They have hundreds of parts jerking to and fro and they cannot be made more powerful without becoming too complicated. 'The engine of the future must produce 2000 horsepower with one moving part: a spinning turbine and compressor.' His work was developed some years earlier than that of Germany's Dr Hans von Ohain who was the designer of the first operational jet engine. Each worked separately and knew nothing of the other's work. Whittle was the first to register a patent for the turbojet engine in January 1930, while Mr von Ohain was granted a patent for his turbojet engine in 1936. However, Mr von Ohain's jet was the first to fly in 1939 - Sir Frank's jet first flew in in 1941. Sir Frank, who was born in Earlsdon, Coventry, retired from the RAF in 1948, was a founding member of the Royal Academy of Engineering and received a knighthood. He later relocated to America and died in 1996 at his home in Columbia, Maryland.

Thin-haired with a large nose and deep-set eyes, it is the unremarkable face of a man who may be the most notorious murderer in history. Astonishingly, it is also the first time anyone has attempted to put together an e-fit of Carl Feigenbaum, one of the men most likely to be Jack the Ripper. The 54-year-old German merchant seaman went to the electric chair in New York in 1894 after the brutal murder of his landlady Juliana Hoffman. E-fit: Carl Feigenbaum was a German sailor who expert Trevor Marriott believes was Jack the Ripper . SIR JOHN WILLIAMSHe was an obstetrician, someone who specialises in pregnancy and women’s reproductive tracts, and treated Queen Victoria’s daughter Princess Beatrice. One of his descendants, Tony Williams, put him forward as the Ripper in 2005 book Uncle Jack, which he co-wrote with Humphrey Price. Their argument is that he killed the women as part of his research into infertility. ROBERT MANNHistorian Mei Trow points the finger at mortuary attendant Robert Mann. He was well educated in anatomy, lived locally and came from a poor background. The first two victims, Polly Nichols and Annie Chapman, are known to have been delivered to his mortuary. PRINCE ALBERT VICTOR . He killed the women after being driven insane by syphilis, according to an article in The Criminologist in 1970 by Dr Thomas E A Stowell. MONTAGUE JOHN DRUITTDruitt was a barrister who came under suspicion because he committed suicide just after the final murder. However, he lived in Kent – and most Ripper experts believe the suspect was local to Whitechapel. DR THOMAS NEILL CREAMCream, a doctor specialising in abortions, was hanged in 1892 for several murders he committed in London and his last words were reportedly ‘I am Jack…’. A psychopath with a self-confessed penchant for mutilating women, even his own lawyer believed he was the Ripper. Now, to mark the 123rd anniversary of the first murder, Ripper expert Trevor Marriott has composed his portrait from a detailed description made when he was admitted to prison. And if the former murder squad detective is correct, it may finally put a face to this most elusive of murderers. Mr Marriot put together the picture for a BBC documentary which airs tonight and identifies Feigenbaum as the man most likely to be Jack. He comprehensively reviewed the five key murders of prostitutes Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly. He then got on the trail of his suspect after investigating groups of people who may have been in Whitechapel at the time of the killings, which took place between August and November 1888. These included sailors as the district - famed for its prostitutes and taverns - is just a short distance from London's docks. Mr Marriott began examining crew lists for ships that were in dock in the autumn of 1888. It was then he had a breakthrough. Feigenbaum, already among 200 names in the frame, had been aboard a boat called the Reiher, which had been in the East End in the critical period. For Mr Marriott, the puzzle began to piece itself together. Gaps in the killings indicated the perpetrator had been a traveller. Feigenbaum had admitted he was overcome by the desire to mutilate women. And then there was his lawyer's dramatic statement after his execution at Sing Sing jail. 'I believe that Carl Feigenbaum, whom you have just seen put to death in the electric chair, can easily be connected with the Jack the Ripper murders in Whitechapel, London,' William Lawton told reporters. 'I will stake my professional reputation that if the police will trace this man's movements carefully for the last few years their investigations will lead them to London and to Whitechapel.' He detailed a confession Feigenbaum made late one night. 'I have for years suffered from a singular disease, which induces an all absorbing passion,' the prisoner told him. 'This passion manifests itself in a desire to kill and mutilate every woman who falls in my way. 'At such times I am unable to control myself.' Brutal: Mary Ann Nicholls, left, had her throat cut while Annie Chapman, right, had her womb removed . Gruesome: Catherine Eddowes, left, had her stomach ripped open and . Elizabeth Stride, right, had an artery severed on the right-side of her . neck . Lawton believed his client had . intended to mutilate landlady Mrs Hoffman, 56. But she screamed so much . as he cut her throat that, fearing he would be caught, he fled. Police quickly captured him. He was put to death on April 27 1896 but the execution was not without drama. Officials gave him three huge bolts of . electricity, administering the final burst as they did not believe he . was alive - but neither were they convinced that he was dead. There are many, however, who doubt that Feigenbaum was actually Jack the Ripper. Little is known about his life beyond the thinnest of details and prosecutor Vernon M.S. Davis described him as a 'cunning fellow, surrounded by a great deal of mystery'. Grisly: A drawing of Feigenbaum being electrocuted, left, and right, a 19th century version of the wanted poster depicting the Ripper attacking one of his victims . The most concrete information is his physical description, catalogued so carefully on the Sing Sing remand form. He had  grey eyes, dark brown hair and . a 'medium sized head' with a hat size of 6 7/8 or 7, stood  5ft4½ tall . and weighed 126lbs. The prison official noted he had thin hair on the top of his head and a slim neck. 'Eyes small and deep-set,' he noted. 'Eyebrows curved. Forehead high and heavily arched. 'Nose large, red and has raw pimples. Teeth poor and nearly all gone on left sides. 'Anchor in india ink on right hand at base of thumb and first finger. 'Round scar or birthmark on right leg below left knee.' Feigenbaum appears to have had a number of aliases, living as an itinerant seaman across Europe and America. And it is his relatively humble profession that make many believe he could not possibly been the Ripper. It . has usually been presumed that the surgical precision of the . mutilations indicated a killer with intimate knowledge of the human . anatomy. However, Mr Marriot . argues that the removal of the women's organs may actually have taken . place in at the mortuary, the body parts reserved for medical training.","German merchant seaman, 54, had penchant for mutilating women ."

Mitt Romney has attempted to shift attention away from the controversy over when he truly left Bain Capital by accusing Barack Obama of favouring political donors with government contracts in a form of cronyism that ‘stinks to high heaven’. Appearing on Fox News, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee said: ‘This is a tough time for the people of America. But if you’re a campaign contractor to Barack Obama, your business may stand to get millions or hundreds of millions in cash from the government.' In a conference call with reporters, Romney advisers said they were gathering examples of Mr Obama's ‘Chicago-style politics’ to prove to voters there was an insidious ‘pattern’ of contracts being awarded to donors. Crony capitalism? President Obama has been accused of giving government contracts to campaign donors . Under fire: Mitt Romney has found himself under attack for his record at private equity firm Bain Capital . The Romney campaign also released a new internet ad using a clip of Mr Obama singing Al Green's Let's Stay Together to insinuate suggest ties between donors and the Obama administration. It was also a retort to an Obama television commercial featuring Mr Romney's off-key rendition of America the Beautiful. Ed Gillespie, a senior Romney aide, said: ‘There are countless examples of this over the past three and a half years, whether it’s the Department of Energy or the stimulus bill, or the Department of Health and Human services and the Obamacare bill, and over the course of the next few days we're going to be highlighting some of these examples of how the Obama economy works.’ The Romney campaign has highlighted Solyndra, a California solar energy company that went bankrupt, and Westly Group, a venture capital firm whose affiliated companies have received federal loans and grants. Steve Westly, the company's founder, is a major Obama campaign fundraiser. But the Romney campaign said it would not release details of its campaign ‘bundlers’, as Mr Obama has done. The decision provides further ammunition to Democrats, who have accused Mr Romney of a lack of transparency. Mr Romney has said he will not release any tax returns beyond those for 2010, which have already been made public, and 2011, which are still being finalised, despite pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to do so. Accusations: The Romney campaign is keen to highlight Mr Obama's support of failed company Solyndra . Protest: Democrats and campaigners are pushing Mr Romney to release more details of his tax returns . Mr Gillespie told Laura Ingraham, a conservative talk radio host, that the Obama focus on Bain was designed to distract from the President’s poor economic record. ‘What we’re seeing here is what Barack Obama warned about in 2008 in his acceptance speech in Denver, when he said, you know, when you don’t have anything to run on, you try to make big elections about small things.’ Pressed on the issue of tax returns, Mr Gillespie said that Mr Romney wasn’t budging. ‘He’s releasing 2010 and 2011 and we’re happy to talk about those. ‘But the fact is what we really want to talk about are the Romney plans for creating jobs in our economy, for turning this economy around, getting it moving again, stopping the excessive regulation, the mandates and the onslaught of taxes and debt. That’s what the American people want to talk about and the constant effort to hold up shiny objects and distractions – we’re going to keep focused on what the voters care about and what matters to them. ‘It’s not Mitt Romney’s tax returns. It’s their tax returns and are they able to have income to file a tax return? Do they have a job? We have over half a million people – fewer Americans working today than when Barack Obama took office.’ Swing state campaign: Mr Obama travelled on Air Force One to an airport near Cincinnati, Ohio . Mr Romney has found himself on the defensive over federal documents filed by Bain Capital that conflicted with his statements about when he left Bain Capital. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in February 2001, Bain Capital listed Mr Romney as the company's ‘sole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president’. It said Mr Romney's ‘principal occupation’ was as Bain's managing director. Mr Romney's campaign, backed up by a number of independent fact checkers, has repeatedly said Mr Romney had almost nothing to do with the company's operations after February 1999, when he began work on the imperilled 2002 Winter Olympic Games. The significance of the period from 1999 to 2001 is that it covers the time when Bain oversaw investments that either sent jobs abroad or filed for bankruptcy. It is also when Mr Romney stated in federal disclosure forms that he was not active in Bain Capital. Mr Romney has said that neither Senator John McCain, the 2008 Republican nominee, nor Senator John Kerry, the 2004 Democratic nominee, released more than a years' worth of tax returns as candidates. But the Obama campaign has been successful in making Mr Romney’s estimated wealth of at least $250million a key focus of the campaign, for the time being at least. Mr Romney also faces difficulties explaining his secrecy over his tax returns because his father Governor George Romney of Michigan released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968.","Romney campaign accuses Obama of giving government funds to donors .

What could be the site of the largest mass human sacrifice in the bloody history of Mexico's ancient civilisations has been discovered. Archaeologists working at the site near to Mexico City have so far unearthed 150 skulls with just one or two vertaebrae attached - suggesting they were hacked off the victims. Dated to between 600 and 850AD, the skulls were found in an area miles from the nearest large city of the day, and researchers say the discovery could challenge existing notions about the area's ancient culture. An ancient skull found near to Mexico City: Researchers have found what could be the the site of the largest mass human sacrifice in the bloody history of Mexico's ancient civilisations. This skull is from an earlier find . 'It's absolutely remarkable to think about this little nothing on the landscape having potentially evidence of the largest mass human sacrifice in ancient Meso-America,' said Christopher Morehart of Georgia State University. He is co-author a study detailing the findings published this month in the journal Latin American Antiquity. Dr Morehart, an archaeologist at Georgia's anthropology department, and colleagues stumbled across the site while using Google Earth to investigate ancient waterworks surrounding the ancient kingdom of Teotihuacan. That mysterious city, home to the famous Pyramid of the Sun, flourished from 200 to 650AD but, to date, the civilisation that built it remains unknown. It was in the now-drained Lake Xaltocan, which was at the time surrounded by nothing more than rural farmland, that Dr Morehart discovered a site which showed evidence of looting, LiveScience reported. Closer investigation revealed the skulls, as well as a shrine with water-deity statues, incense burners and agricultural pottery like corncob depictions, which researchers said suggested a ritual purpose tied to farming. Dr Morehart told LiveScience that carbon dating of the skulls suggested they were at least 1,100 years old. Most were from men. The find is similar, but much earlier than, the discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath Mexico City reported in October last year. Archaeologists excavating the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan, on the site of the modern-day Mexican capital, found the 500-year-old remains around a sacrificial stone in the city's Sacred Precinct . But while the provenance of that burial site was quickly ascertained, there is no clue as to how assembled the Lake Xaltocan cache of skulls. Bloody history: The find is similar, but much earlier than, the discovery of 50 decapitated skulls and 250 jaw bones beneath Mexico City reported in October last year. This picture is from that discovery . The team chose not to release photos of these latest skulls because the sacrificial victims may be historically tied to indigenous people still living in the area. Destiny Crider, an archaeologist with Luther College in Iowa who was not part of the research team said that the findings could lead to a revision of historical accounts of the region. The site is not associated with Teotihuacan or other regional powers, she told LiveScience, and its location is unlike the great pyramids within cities where such sacrifices usually took place. She also suggested that the shrine and the fact that most of the victims were male suggest they were carefully chosen and not simply the result of indiscriminate slaughter of locals. Many researchers believe the kingdom of Teotihuacan fell as a result of a disastrous drought, and there followed a period of warfare as smaller regional powers competed for supremacy. Dr Crider suggested the political instability could have spurred merciless innovation in the region's bloody sacrifice rituals. 'Maybe they needed to intensify their activities because everything was changing,' she told LiveScience. 'When things are uncertain you try new strategies.'","Find could challenge the conventional account of Meso-American history .

Plastic manhole covers are being trialled in a drastic move by a local authority after scrap metal thieves stripped an area of the traditional road coverings. Councillors in North Somerset have ordered the trial after scores of the covers were stolen earlier this year. The move comes as scrap metal theft reaches almost epidemic proportions across the UK. Plastic replacement: The cheaper covers are being tested in North Somerset following a spate of thefts . Nineteen manhole and drain covers, which are made out of wrought iron and cost an average £4000, were stolen in just 48 hours across North Somerset in March. The new plastic replacements cost only £400 and are built to last for 15 years where their metal counterparts require replacement after five years. North Somerset Council is now working with motorcyclists in the Nailsea area to determine whether the plastic anti-skid cover are a safe alternative. North Somerset Council spokesman, Nick Yates, said: 'We are trialling a new type of cover in one location in Nailsea. It is made of plastic and is anti-skid. 'We are now working with a local motorcycle group to monitor and get feedback from the group into the performance of the cover over the coming months. Metal target: Manhole and drain covers are being stolen countrywide as the cost of scrap metal rises . 'The new covers are also less likely to be stolen as they have no scrap value. We are trialling one of the plastic covers and if this proves successful, we would hope to use them in other areas across the district.' Local residents have also complained that the covers at Church Lane in Backwell have yet to be replaced despite them being stolen  nine months ago. The council has cordoned off the area around the missing covers to warn drivers and pedestrians, but residents say work needs to be done urgently to replace them. Some councils have reported the theft of manhole covers, wheelchair ramps and even children's playground equipment. Rail . companies are having power and signalling equipment stolen on a daily . basis across the network with British Transport Police admitting number . of thefts 'is huge'. As . police admit they are failing to keep up with the thefts around the . country sparked by the global rise in metal prices there is growing . pressure on the government to reform the 1964 Scrap Metal Dealers Act. The . coalition is considering licensing scrap metal dealers, banning them . from dealing in cash and giving police powers to close rogue traders . down. Ministers are considering the crackdown on the industry worth £5bn a year to the economy. It is thought that more than 15,000 tonnes of metal is stolen in the UK each year. One resident said: 'There is no street lighting to speak of along Church Lane and to have these open manholes surrounded by barriers in the middle of the road is a safety hazard. One of the cordons is just around a blind bend and when you come around the corner you are on top of it before you have noticed. 'I wouldn’t have thought it would have taken more than six to eight weeks to order replacements and get them fitted. 'I believe there are some concerns about the fitting of these manholes because of the utilities which may be under the road. 'But other companies seem to manage to carry out work without these problems, so why can’t North Somerset Council. I am concerned that nine months on, these covers have not been replaced.' Mr Yates said the covers were being replaced but there had been delays because surveys needed to be carried out first. The metal covers need to be drilled into the road surface and sometimes cables and pipes lie underneath. The council is also appealing to anyone who sees anything suspicious to report it immediately to the police.","Thieves stripped area in Somerset in under 48 hours .

His body was found by a teenaged jogger on June 17, 2013, in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's house in North Attleborough, Massachusetts. Lloyd, 27, had been shot five times at close range. Also on Wednesday, prosecution witness Vanessa Sanchez took the stand. She told jurors that she and her boyfriend had met the football player and his fiancée, Shayanna, along with another couple at the South Street Cafe in Providence, Rhode Island on June 16 at 11pm - around four hours before Odin Lloyd was killed. Hernandez and Shayanna left around midnight, Miss Sanchez said. Providence is about a 30 minute drive from the couple's home in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. Prosecutors contend Hernandez and two friends, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, picked up Lloyd at his Boston home about 2.30am, before driving him to the North Attleboro industrial area where his body was found. All three men have pleaded not guilty. Hernandez, 25, had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was cut from the team shortly after being charged with Lloyd's murder in June 2013. He also faces various firearms charges . On Tuesday, a woman who cleaned Hernandez's home testified that his fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, was visibly nervous and spent time on the telephone, looking out the window and crying after hauling away a large trash bag in the trunk of a car the day after Lloyd was killed.

'He was really bloated and didn't look well - we could see he had eaten a 750g tin of Quality Street so we took him to the vets.' After spending two days in vets' care, Booster was sent home but still seemed to be in pain. When Mr Kelly returned to weeks later, an X-ray revealed the pet had swallowed five rubber balls that were lodged in his stomach.

The dog owner knew something was wrong with his pet after finding him writhing in pain and bloated 'to the size of a cow' one morning after Christmas . Adam Coulson, of Plymouth Veterinary Hospital where Booster was treated, said the dog's pain came after gases from the chocolates stopped his blood flow. 'His immediate problem was that all of the gas blowing up his stomach was preventing blood from flowing back to his heart, and so his circulation was failing.' It was only weeks later Mr Coulson discovered the toys lurking in his stomach. 'X-rays showed some very strange shadows in his abdomen and exploratory surgery yielded two balls and three toys from his now slightly sagging stomach. 'However, not a Quality Street in sight.

The 19-year-old, who claims that he walked across the border with Turkey to join a group fighting Bashir Assad's forces last night took part in a live web Q&A with wannabe jihadists. During the online livechat he incited children as young as 16 to 'put their faith in Allah' and join the holy war.

(File picture) A British teenager - who claimed to be a jihadist - tried to recruit youngsters on the site ask.fm . The teenager responded to questions on the social media website askfm, using the alias Abu Dujana. During the insightful question session, he described wages for jihadists - $40 a month plus $40 for each family member - and detailed some of the hardships of war, the scarcity of food on the frontline and going to the toilet in a hole in the mountain. He said he had flown to Turkey, several months ago, and crossed the border easily before joining his group. If caught by authorities 'just say you are a journalist', he counselled. The young mujahideen said he accepts he cannot return to Britain on pain of jail, but so far he did not miss life back home. He said: 'Saving lives is better than a red passport', adding, 'I only miss my family, nothing else. Ok I miss coco pops, i admit that...' He explained: 'What motivates me is that the muslims of sham are being killed, tortured and raped and as muslims we must believe that they are also family.'

ff9346940e3926222007b27849d89abdb2e84e97,"(CNN) -- Dutchman Edgar Davids has lifted the European Champions League trophy, won league titles in Italy and the Netherlands and played in a World Cup semifinal against Brazil in 1998. So why has a soccer star like Davids, who won 74 international caps for the Netherlands between 1994 and 2005, decided to become joint head coach of Barnet, who are currently rock bottom of the lowest tier of professional in England. ""I'm happy to explore my possibilities and share my knowledge and experience with Barnet Football Club,"" the 39-year-old told the London club's official website. ""I am very excited about the challenge ahead."" Blog: Does international soccer need a shake up? After a playing career which spanned two decades and saw Davids strut his stuff at the San Siro and the Nou Camp, the one-time midfield dynamo will now be pacing the touchline of Barnet's 6,000-capacity Underhill Stadium in north London. In addition to his coaching responsibilities, Davids also hopes to make a playing return for ""The Bees"" as soon as possible. Barnet would be the third English team Davids -- who was nicknamed ""The Pitbull"" in recognition of his fiesty playing style -- has turned out for following two years with Tottenham Hotspur between 2005 and 2007 and a brief spell with second-tier Crystal Palace in 2010. A spell in English football's lower reaches is in stark contrast to previous stages of Davids' career, following stints with Ajax, AC Milan, Barcelona and Juventus. ""I am delighted to welcome Edgar to our club,"" said Mark Robson, the current Barnet head coach who will now job share with Davids. ""His experience as a player throughout his illustrious career will be a massive benefit to all our players and I look forward to forming a strong partnership with him"". Davids is also known for the goggles he sports while playing, a necessity due to him suffering from the eye disease glaucoma. Barnet has spent the majority of its history at the lower end of English football, winning the Conference -- the division immediately below England's top four professional leagues -- on two occasions.","Edgar Davids becomes joint head coach of English club Barnet .

ff93b3f02e965ff3f13f5b5069d0bad1fc52c40e,"Police have released images of three Chelsea football fans they believe were involved in an allegedly racist incident on a Paris Metro train. The Metropolitan Police are appealing for help to identify the trio, who they think were among a group of Chelsea supporters who pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song while on the way to a Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain in the French capital on Tuesday. Friday's appeal comes as Chelsea  suspended another two people from Stamford Bridge following investigations into the incident, taking the total number to five. Chelsea fans were filmed chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' while on the train . Chelsea fans stopped a black man getting on the train before their side's match with Paris Saint-Germain . The man was twice prevented from getting on the carriage as the fans pushed him back on to the platform . The Metropolitan police released images of three men they are keen to speak to following the incident in Paris . The three singled out by the Met in images taken from the Metro are not the same as the trio initially suspended by Chelsea. The club reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the racist altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris. Footage captured by a bystander appears to show a commuter, identified in media reports as French-Mauritian Souleymane S, being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'. The club had already suspended three men while its investigations continued, and on Friday evening announced that two more people would be barred. 'Chelsea Football Club has suspended a further two people from Stamford Bridge as a result of ongoing investigations into the incident on the Paris Metro on Tuesday evening. This makes a total of five to date,' a statement on the club website said. 'If it is deemed there is sufficient evidence of their involvement in the incident, the club will issue banning orders for life.' A club spokesman revealed Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich (right) is 'disgusted' by the incident . Chelsea insist they have apologised in writing to Souleymane and invited him and his family to London to attend the second leg of the European clash against PSG on March 11, while a spokesman stated that owner Roman Abramovich is 'disgusted' by the incident. In an interview given to BBC Radio 5 Live on Friday afternoon, Souleymane argued that Chelsea hold a degree of liability for the conduct of their fans and has yet to receive any contact from Stamford Bridge. 'Chelsea are partly responsible and I have brought a complaint. They have partial responsibility because it's their supporters,' Souleymane said. 'Chelsea need to call my lawyers and they haven't done that yet, unlike PSG. Their director general has called my lawyer and he called me. I haven't had any reply from Chelsea. Nothing.' Mourinho, speaking about the incident for the first time, has revealed his own anguish but stresses that the men involved should not be viewed as genuine fans of the club. 'We feel ashamed but maybe we shouldn't because we - I - refuse to be connected with these people,' Mourinho said. 'I'm connected with Chelsea and the many good things this club defends and represents. I left Chelsea in 2007 and I couldn't wait to come back. 'I felt ashamed when I knew what happened, but I repeat I'm a proud Chelsea manager because I know what this club is. 'I feel ashamed to have been connected with this sad episode that happened and I have no more words.' Jose Mourinho (left) admits he feels 'ashamed' by the racially-motivated incident involving Chelsea fans . Mourinho, who wants Souleymane to visit Stamford Bridge because he 'probably has the wrong idea about Chelsea', confirmed that his views are shared in the dressing room. 'The reaction of the players is the same reaction that we all have,' said Mourinho. 'I have a squad at Chelsea where 12 or 14 players have African nationality or an African connection. 'Our dressing room has always had big principles of equality over everything - race, religion, everything. 'So the dressing room reacted in the same way I did, with disappointment and obviously condemning the situation and supporting the gentleman involved. 'But there is also the feeling that while we feel ashamed, maybe we shouldn't because we are not this and these people don't belong to us. 'Since minute one we have done absolutely everything because we have zero tolerance to this. We have to keep feeling our club is a great club and has no space for people like this.' Branislav Ivanovic gives Chelsea the lead on Tuesday night in their Champions League last 16 tie with PSG . The Chelsea team applaud their travelling fans at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday night . Mourinho's weekly press conference ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League match against Burnley at Stamford Bridge was dominated by discussion of the racist abuse witnessed on the Paris underground. A club spokesman opened proceedings with a statement in which he said Chelsea were 'appalled by what we saw', branding the incident as 'unforgivable' and declaring that 'the people involved do not represent Chelsea football club'. When Mourinho was asked how offensive it is that the supporters used the name of club captain John Terry to justify their actions, the spokesman intervened by saying: 'We're not interested in any excuses or stories to try and cover these actions'. Terry was given a four-match ban and fined £220,000 in 2012 after being found guilty by the Football Association of racially abusing QPR defender Anton Ferdinand. Chelsea fans let off a flare inside the Parc des Princes during the last 16 first leg encounter on Tuesday night . Chelsea fans are kept back by police after the final whistle of the Champions League match on Tuesday night . Mourinho was also referred to his comments relating to last October's calls to introduce the 'Rooney Rule' when he declared 'there is no racism in football'. 'I was asked about players choosing players or managers or not choosing them because of their race. Maybe I am naive, but I think that no club refuses a top manager or player because of his race,' he said. 'This is what I said. I did not say there is no racism in football. This not football, this is society, it is public transport. Maybe the people with Chelsea scarves don't even like football or Chelsea. I don't know.' Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck met with Kick it Out chairman Lord Ouseley on Friday as a demonstration of club's commitment to fighting discrimination and racism.

And a spokesman for Scandinavian Airlines said reports of danger to the plane or passengers were ""blown out of proportion."" Knut Morten Johansen said the flight wasn't forced to change course, but that the pilot took normal advice from air traffic control. ""No security borders were breached,"" he said, adding that it was a ""totally safe flight."" Byden said Swedish fighter jets were immediately deployed to identify the aircraft and later determined it was a Russian intelligence plane. He said the Russian military aircraft's transponders were turned off to avoid commercial radar. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman maintained the flight was a safe distance from civilian aircraft. ""No prerequisites existed for an air accident related with a flight of a Russian warplane in the international air space over the Baltic Sea on Friday,"" Maj. Gen.

ff9497372de52b36806b8c93acb22aa68ed0c22e,"(CNN) -- The Hillsborough County, Florida, sheriff on Wednesday offered a personal apology to a disabled man who was dumped onto the floor from his wheelchair while in deputies' custody. Brian Sterner has been using a wheelchair since a 1994 wrestling accident. ""I am personally embarrassed and shocked by the horrific treatment Mr. Sterner received,"" Sheriff David Gee says in a statement on the department's Web site. A video now making the rounds on television networks and various Web sites shows a deputy tipping Brian Sterner, 32, out of a wheelchair at the county's booking center in Tampa on January 29. ""I cannot and will not even try to offer an explanation for what is seen on the video, other than to say, that once it was brought to my attention, I immediately initiated an internal investigation,"" Gee said. Sterner had been picked up by sheriff's deputies on a warrant for a charge of fleeing and attempting to elude police in an incident in October of last year, his attorney said. ""This deputy ... she looked at me, she didn't believe that I was a quadriplegic, I guess, and she walked behind me with those handles on the back of that hospital-grade wheelchair and she just dumped it straight forward,"" Sterner told Tampa television station WTSP.  Watch the incident on tape » . As Sterner lay crumpled on the floor, two female deputies frisked him. ""I told them how to pick me up and put me back in the chair, but without sensation -- I don't feel anything from my chest down -- so I didn't know they were broken then, my ribs,"" he added. John Trevena, Sterner's attorney, said the sheriff denied that his client's ribs were broken, saying that X-rays showed no fractures. Sterner spent five days in the jail's infirmary before being released on $2,000 bond, Trevena said. The deputy responsible for dumping Sterner from the chair has been suspended without pay, Gee said in his statement. The three supervisors who were on duty during the incident have also been suspended, but with pay, the sheriff's public information office told CNN. ""The incident involving Mr. Sterner was not caused by a lack of training or procedure,"" the sheriff's statement said. ""It represents aberrant behavior that is totally out of context with policies, practices and standards of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office. ""Last year over 72,000 inmates were processed through central booking, more than 230 of them came to jail in wheelchairs,"" he added. Gee said he offered his personal apology to Sterner for ""the treatment he received."" ""I want to assure him, and the public at large, that this incident is not indicative of the behavior of the over 3,500 men and women of the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office who perform their duties with pride and professionalism on a daily basis,"" he said. Trevena said his client would likely not file a lawsuit in the matter, because Gee has pledged to ""make it right.""  Watch a legal analyst discuss the incident » . ""He was very apologetic, very contrite,"" the attorney told CNN in a phone interview Wednesday, referring to a conversation he had with the sheriff Tuesday. ""I don't believe a lawsuit is going to be necessary. He said he will do anything and everything to make it right."" Trevena said Gee is handing the matter over to the state's attorney to review for possible criminal charges. The lawyer said the arrest was a complete surprise to Sterner, who had received only a ticket after police stopped him in his hand-pedal-controlled car for failing to yield in October. At the time, the attorney said, Sterner also submitted to a blood test and no illegal substances were found in his blood. Sterner became disabled in a wrestling accident when he was 18, Trevena said. Sterner took his story to WTSP a few days after he was released from custody, his attorney said, and the station obtained the booking video from the sheriff's department.

ff95cbf06bc9e4b2b0c4bb7b46794e63cacaa834,"(CNN) -- Henrik Stenson's accountant must be grinning from ear to ear after the Swedes's incredible winning streak last year. But the world No. 3 isn't getting carried away. ""Like someone said: 'Money is only paper,' right? It's not really going to make you much more happy or extremely sad if you lose a bit,"" Stenson says. Easy to say, perhaps, after netting a cool $20 million in prize money in 2013. But it's not the fiscal peaks that have helped shape the 37-year-old's apparently easy-going attitude to money as much as one spectacular loss. Stenson was a victim of the convicted fraudster Allen Stanford and reportedly lost several million dollars in the Texan's $7 billion Ponzi scheme, which was uncovered in 2009. The Swede said it wasn't so much the scale of the losses but rather the way in which the money went. ""It was probably more about, you know, how you lose something when you think something is a safe investment when it turns out it (isn't),"" Stenson told CNN's Shane O'Donoghue. ""That's got to be more disappointing than taking it to the casino -- you lose, but you know what the risks are. That was probably more what upset me the most about the whole thing. ""I guess I was in a position where I can make up for it in a pretty short space of time. Other people wouldn't be so lucky. For me, it's like a closed chapter. I moved on long ago, but I keep getting reminded of it now and again,"" he says, before breaking into a smile. Getting up and down . He can afford to smile after becoming the first golfer to win both the PGA Tour's FedExCup and the European Tour's Race to Dubai in the same season. Stenson claimed the $10 million prize for winning the FedExCup after winning the season-ending Tour Championship at Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club in September before storming to a six-stroke victory in the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai eight weeks later. It was an unprecedented end to a season which saw Stenson return to golf's top table after recovering from a debilitating and prolonged slump. After winning golf's ""fifth major,"" The Players Championship at Sawgrass in May 2009, Stenson looked set to join the sport's elite with strong showings at the U.S. Open (ninth place) and the U.S.PGA Championship (tied sixth) later that season. A tie for third in the Open Championship at St Andrews the following year only seemed to confirm his status as a serious contender for a major title. But things fell apart in the second half of 2010 before completely unraveling in 2011 with a succession of missed cuts and only one top 10 finish all year. As if the loss of form wasn't sickening enough, Stenson then picked up a waterborne parasite on holiday in November 2011 which led to a bout of viral pneumonia. ""He lost what we call the ground force because physically he was poorly,"" says Pete Cowen, Stenson's long-time swing coach. ""If you lose your physical strength you lose all your control."" That lack of power sent Stenson tumbling down the rankings from a career high of world No. 5 in 2009 to 230th. It wasn't the first time Stenson had gone from golden boy to nowhere man. A year after clinching his maiden European Tour victory in 2001 (at the now defunct Benson and Hedges International Open) the Swede missed 14 cuts and won just over â‚¬40,000 ($55,000). ""It was big slump. They were really tough times,"" he recalls. ""I was really lost with my game, I lost my confidence."" On course for recovery . The second, more recent reverse was less to do with any technical deficiencies than with ""frustrations,"" he says at not being able to compete like he used to. ""The most important thing I did with my old sport psychologist (Torsten Hansson) was to start working on the long-term planning. When you are down and out, it's so easy (to go for) short-term solutions,"" Stenson said. ""The quick fixes don't work. I think you've got to put a plan in place and work towards it -- slow but steady progress -- and eventually you will get to the point where you want to get."" With a new physical and psychological regime in place, Stenson started to see the green shoots of recovery with victory at the South African Open in November 2012. ""That was hugely important, especially the way I won it because I held the lead for most of the weekend and then dropped back on Sunday and I managed to come back on the back nine. That was huge for the confidence ... after three-and-a-half years without a win."" Stenson's season-ending victories may have grabbed all the headlines but his comeback year also included his best-ever performance at a major championship -- second to Phil Mickelson in the Open Championship at Muirfield -- backed up by a third- place finish at the U.S.PGA Championship. A major breakthrough? So can he break his duck in 2014 and become Sweden's first major winner? ""If my game is in good shape and it's my week, I definitely think so,"" he says. Cowen can also see his pupil of 13 years clinching that elusive prize. ""He's a complex person,"" says Cowen. ""One day he's up, the next day he's down. When he's up, he's very, very good, but when he's down, you know ... but that's what the best players are like. ""I would think Henrik is one of a few players who can win tournaments on ball striking alone. He's certainly got the game. There are quite a few players who deserve to win majors, but unfortunately you have to win them."" Stenson will get his first chance at Augusta National in April, but before that will be lining up at Dove Mountain, Arizona for the WGC Match Play Championship on February 19 -- a tournament that he won in 2007. Whatever happens this coming week and for the rest of the season, Stenson appears well equipped to deal with what comes his way. ""You know, you are going to have your ups and downs. I might have had two (downs) that were deeper than most, but the belief never went away. ""What we learn is to never give up. If you keep at it, if you keep the belief, you can achieve great things.""

In his final address as G20 chair, Mr Abbott on Sunday thanked world leaders for attending the most influential gathering of world leaders in Australian history. He said there had been a strong spirit of cooperation and moments of candour between the leaders, and a commitment to actually implement their 'action plan'. Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott speaks at the conclusion of the G20 summit in Brisbane on Sunday . US President Barack Obama waves before boarding his flight home after attending the G20 Summit . 'We have published these growth strategies so the world can see what we are committed to and the world can hold us to account,' he told reporters in Brisbane. 'People right around the world are going to be better off and that's what it's all about.' The overarching G20 goal was to boost global economic growth by 2.1 per cent by 2018, which if translated would add $2 trillion to economic activity. Barely had the official G20 summary been released, the leaders were already dashing home, with US President Barack Obama in the air after the summit wrapped up on Sunday. President Obama was spotted boarding his helicopter Marine One at Victoria Park in Bowen Hill before arriving at RAAF Base Amberley, south-west of Brisbane on the outskirts of Ipswich to board his Air Force One plane home. While Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't even hang around that long, citing the need to get back to Moscow and catch up on his sleep as he headed to the special G20 airport in Brisbane before proceedings had even finished.

Meanwhile, Mr Abbott said in his final statement that a working session on trade, which he described as one of the most productive of this G20 weekend, had delivered a unanimous agreement that expanding global trade would directly benefit countries and people right around the world. 'Trade is a key driver of growth, perhaps the key driver of growth, and we're focused on domestic reforms to facilitate trade as well as the importance of a strong global trading system.' He also said a global infrastructure hub would be launched in Sydney as part of a wider initiative to address a global $70 trillion gap in infrastructure by 2030. It would be funded by government and private sector contributions, he said. South African Prime Minister Jacob Zuma is farewelled as he departs Brisbane on Sunday .

Energy ministers would meet for the first time early next year to take work forward on a G20 energy efficiency action plan, Mr Abbott said. 'Energy I'm pleased to say is now at the heart of the G20's agenda,' he said. The communique from the Brisbane summit also included specific mention of climate change. Mr Abbott said all leaders had voiced support for strong and effective action to address climate change. 'Our actions will support sustainable development, economic growth and certainty for business and investment and, of course, we will all work constructively towards the climate change conference in Paris next year.'

The G20 leaders committed backed a global crackdown on tax avoidance by multinational companies. 'If banks get into trouble taxpayers should not be bailing them out,' Mr Abbott said. 'And big business must pay its fair share of tax and it must pay its fair share of tax in the jurisdiction where they earned the profits.' It was put to Mr Abbott that there had been some disagreement among leaders on the extent to which climate change featured in the communique, and that US President Barack Obama had argued strongly against the prime minister's position on the use of fossil fuels. Mr Abbott has pledged to work with world leaders to deliver real outcomes . Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott speaks to the media during a press conference at the conclusion of the G-20 summit in Brisbane on Sunday . 'As for coal, without going into the details of who said what to whom and exactly what intervention was about what subject, I should remind everyone that right now there are 1.3 billion people right around the globe who have no access whatsoever to electricity,' Mr Abbott said. 'And not only was the communique drafting process constructive and collegial but the discussion in the room today was very constructive and collegial. 'I just want to make that absolutely crystal clear, that from the very beginning, climate change was in the draft communique.' U.S. President Barack Obama gestures as he answers questions during his news conference on Sunday . President Barack Obama, Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shake hands at the start of their meeting at the G-20 Summit in Brisbane on Sunday . The prime minister said labour market reforms were also crucial, of which lifting female participation was the 'principal commitment'. He said that if female participation was closer to male participation in every country of the G20, 'billions if not trillions of dollars in additional growth' would be unlocked. Meanwhile, Brisbanites will soon get their city back as the riot fences are removed and special laws that made it illegal to carry reptiles on some streets expire. Police declared it a triumph, with no major incidents reported from the 6000 officers deployed to patrol the often empty streets in the city's CBD and south bank areas. The mercury soared, with snipers atop Brisbane rooftops reporting extreme temperatures beyond 60 degrees Celsius. Protests were numerous, colourful, but peaceful. Inside the giant Brisbane convention centre, 3000 journalists from across the globe bunkered down to cover the G20 proceedings. In the end the business side of the two-day spectacle was distilled into an unassuming three-page communique.

The world leaders also discussed the fight against the terrororist group ISIS as well as the Ebola epidemic . The overarching goal is to achieve more than two per cent economic growth in the bloc above business as usual by 2018. The real test will be whether countries come good on their promises, but that's really for the next G20 host - Turkey - to oversee. There were also commitments to crackdown on tax avoidance, bolster financial markets from shocks and shore up the banks deemed 'too big to fail'. But despite the Abbott government's wish for a narrow agenda under its G20 presidency, there was much more to the G20 than just jobs and growth. Climate change and the Ebola outbreak were hot topics, dominating talks on the sidelines of the main event.

That was awesome, just like Fridays! Wonder if those horses were neighbors. Whether you live next door or halfway around the world, we welcome all of our viewers to CNN Student News. First Up: Roof Collapse . AZUZ: So, let's say you're a Steelers or Packers fan. You're heading to the Super Bowl in Dallas, Texas to get away from the cold weather in your hometown. But when you show up in Texas, the wind chill is 10 degrees below zero! Believe that! That's what it felt like in Dallas yesterday. Throw in several inches of snow and ice, parts of the city just shut down. One Packers player said it was funny to see everything closed. He said in Green Bay, this would've been a normal day. What we're about to show you, though, is not normal. Watch this. That's the power of this snowstorm. The roof of the building in Massachusetts completely collapsed under the weight of all the snow. Luckily, everyone who was inside got out safely ahead of time. Prayer Breakfast . AZUZ: The National Prayer Breakfast has taken place in Washington, D.C. every year for nearly six decades. During yesterday's prayer breakfast, President Obama gave a very personal speech about his religious faith. He talked about how his faith sustains him and how he asks God for strength. The president wasn't the only speaker at the event. U.S. astronaut Mark Kelly -- he is the husband of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords -- gave the closing prayer. He also talked about his wife's recovery from a shooting attack in Arizona. The president also talked about violence that's taking place in a different part of the world. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We pray that the violence in Egypt will end, and that the rights and aspirations of the Egyptian people will be realized. And that a better day will dawn over Egypt and throughout the world. Egypt Unrest & Social Media . AZUZ: People who support and people who are against Egypt's government continued to fight against each other in the country's capital of Cairo on Thursday, though the fighting wasn't as intense as it was the day before. In an interview with Christiane Amanpour of ABC News, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who's the main focus of these protests, said he was very unhappy about the fighting. He also said that he would leave office right away, but that he didn't want to risk plunging his nation into chaos. Political protests certainly aren't a new idea. They've been happening for centuries. But as Karen Caifa explains for us now, there is a very modern twist to these protests in Egypt. (BEGIN VIDEO) KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT, WASHINGTON, D.C.: Pictures that speak a thousand words. Protests fueled by 140 characters. The unrest in Egypt targets the 30-year tenure of leader Hosni Mubarak, protests led by a generation that's come of age and found their voice in the era of social media. NASSER WEDDADY, AMERICAN ISLAMIC CONGRESS: You have a generation right now, an entire generation that was born under the Mubarak rule, that has taken to the streets and they want him out. CAIFA: While the percentage of Egyptians engaging in social media is small compared to that in the United States, like young Americans, it's young Egyptians making the most use of it. So before they took to the streets, they took to Twitter and to Facebook to mobilize, organize, to share their anger with each other and with the world. But at points during the height of the unrest, those tools went dark, with reports of the Egyptian government cracking down on Twitter and Facebook use, and cutting off internet access. A move criticized by the White House. ROBERT GIBBS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: We believe that the people of Egypt have a right to freedom of expression and freedom of speech, and that includes the use of the internet. CAIFA: And even with postings from within Egypt limited, the events stayed among the top trending topics on Twitter, piquing the interest of social media users worldwide using a number of hashtags. WEDDADY: The demonstrations that you're seeing right now in the streets, that's an example of online activism going back into the real world. (END VIDEO) Health Care Debate . AZUZ: An effort to overturn the controversial Health Care Reform Law will not be moving forward in the U.S. Senate. Senate Democrats blocked the move by Senate Republicans on Wednesday in a 51-to-47 vote that was right down party lines. Two Democratic senators didn't vote. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives voted to overturn the law last month. But with the Senate vote on Wednesday, this debate may be over in Congress. But it's not over in the courts. Earlier this week, a federal judge in Florida ruled that the health care law is unconstitutional. Another judge has ruled the same way. But two other federal judges have said the opposite. All this, what this means, this will probably end up in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. So there's a good chance we haven't heard the end of this health reform law debate. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Linser's social studies classes at Bellevue High School in Bellevue, Washington! On the Chinese calendar, what year has just begun? You know what to do! Is it the Year of the... A) Rabbit, B) Ox, C) Snake or D) Tiger? You've got three seconds -- GO!  The Chinese calendar has just kicked off the Year of the Rabbit. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Chinese New Year . AZUZ: All right. The Chinese calendar is lunar; it's based on the moon. And in a 12-year cycle, every year is assigned a different animal from ancient times. Astrologers describe the rabbit as kind and gentle, so maybe this will be a year of calm in China. Who knows? One thing we do know. These Year of the Rabbit celebrations are hopping, and they're going to go on for two weeks. The new year kicks off a fifteen-day Spring festival. There are parades, like this one. A lot of fireworks and festivities. And we're not just talking about things that happened in China. These celebrations happen in cities all around the world. Digital Dating Abuse . AZUZ: There was a time, when you wanted to ask someone out, you'd pass them a note that said ""Do you want to go out with me? Check yes or no."" And you'd really, really hope she didn't say maybe. These days, dating, of course, as you know, is a lot more high-tech. But the technology can also be used in harmful ways. We have a report now about some of the potential problems of dating in a digital world. (BEGIN VIDEO) CINDY SOUTHWORTH, NATIONAL NETWORK TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: What else makes digital dating abuse, do you think? CAIFA: Inside this classroom at Jefferson Middle School in Washington, D.C., lessons about the technology that connects teens, but also brings new challenges. Many parents are aware of cyberbullying. But others may not know the signs of digital dating abuse. And a recent survey found that more than half of teens know someone who's been a victim. PATRICIA PRIDE, JEFFERSON MIDDLE SCHOOL PRINCIPAL: A lot of the things that happen on Facebook, on MySpace, on the social networks on the weekends, we see filter into the school on Monday morning. CAIFA: Digital dating abuse includes things like excessive or harassing text messages or emails, accessing or manipulating a boyfriend or girlfriend's Facebook or MySpace page, or ""sexting"" with racy photos, all by simply using a mobile phone. SOUTHWORTH: It doesn't necessarily cause dating abuse. You can take the phone away and there's still going to be a controlling relationship, but it's definitely playing out through the technology. CAIFA: So, ""Love is Not Abuse,"" a nationwide coalition that teaches teens about the dangers of domestic violence, now has a bigger focus on the role of the internet and social networking, during and after a relationship. SOUTHWORTH: You're texting a lot, and it's a good thing and both people are happy. But what if you try to break up and the texting keeps happening? CAIFA: The students here were the first to take part in the new curriculum, a kickoff to February's National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. It will soon roll out across the country, a campaign to help students understand that abuse is real, even if it's in the digital realm. In Washington, I'm Karin Caifa for CNN Student News. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go today, we're taking you to an obstacle course where the obstacles are alive! It's at an alligator farm in Florida. And it includes a zip line that takes you right over the gators! The woman on the zip line's thinking, ""cool, gators!"" And the gators are thinking, ""cool, lunch!"" Fearless flyers are strapped onto safety lines at all times. And in truth, you're zipping along about 50 feet over the reptiles' reach. Goodbye . AZUZ: Still, you'd think they would put up a gator something. Maybe these are helpful animals. Maybe if you fall in their pit, they'll just offer you gator-aid. I think that's one of the best one's we've done in awhile. Today's sign-off line from Facebook.com/CNNStudentNews comes from Lindsey, who says a bicycle can't stand alone because it is two-tired.

ff97b21662b03f58759986da5532c554bf36cff8,"President Obama followed through on his threat to 'isolate' Russia for sending troops into the Ukraine against his wishes, suspending all military relations between the two countries on Monday. All scheduled military exercises, meetings and port visits are now cancelled in light of what Mr Obama considers a violation of international law. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent . troops into the Ukrainian sovereign region of Crimea over the weekend, . claiming he was trying to protect ethnic Russians from . 'ultra-nationalistic forces' in the country. 'We call on Russia to de-escalate the crisis in Ukraine and for Russian forces in Crimea to return to their bases, as required under the agreements governing the Russia Black Sea Fleet,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a statement. Kirby added that while there has been speculation in the media about U.S. ship movements in the region, the Pentagon has not changed 'military posture in Europe or the Mediterranean'. Meeting with Israel: Mr Obama answers questions about the ongoing in situation in Ukraine while meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office Monday . President Obama is currently working to rally Western allies in a united front against Russia's recent incursion on the Ukraine. 'I spent the weekend talking to leaders across Europe, and I think the world is largely united in recognizing that the steps Russia has taken are a violation of Ukraine's sovereignty, their territorial integrity,' the president said. Russia justified its invasion of the Crimea to the UN Security Council on Monday, with Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin saying 'legitimately elected officials' had asked Russia to intervene. But U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power shot back, saying the move was 'not a consensual intervention...it is an act of aggression'. Defending the move: U.N. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin speaks during a meeting of the U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday . Calling out: U.S. Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power responded to Churkin's statements, saying it was not a 'consensual' incursion but an  'act of aggression' Russia's invasion of the Ukraine has been in response to the 2014 revolution which resulted in the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled to Moscow. President Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel that he sent troops into the Crimea to protect the ethnic Russians in the region from 'ultranationalistic forces'. About 60 per cent of those living in Crimea are ethnic Russians. But Russian forces seem to be acting as more than just peace keepers in the region. Armed men took control of two airports in the Crimea region on Friday in what Ukraine's government described as an invasion and occupation by Russian forces, stoking tension between Moscow and the West . Tensions rising: A Russian soldier on an armoured personnel carrier halted on a road in Ukraine around 20 miles from Sebastapol, where there is a large Russian military presence . Putin sent troops into the Crimea, going against President Obama's request that he not intervene. Above, Armed Russian navy servicemen surround a Ukrainian border guard base in in the Crimea region on Friday . On Monday, Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Maksim Prauta announced that four Russian navy ships were blocking an anti-submarine warship and command ship and had ordered the crews to surrender or face seizure. Russian authorities have denied the incident. A source at the Defense Ministry told Interfax that the deadline to surrender was 5am Tuesday, but another source said no assault was planned and 'this is complete nonsense'. If true, a U.S. State Department spokesman said this would be a 'dangerous escalation' on Russia's part, for which they would be held accountable. As of 6am local time Tuesday, there had been no military action by the Russian forces, according to the Kyiv Post. Surrender? Ukrainian navy ship Slavutich is seen in Sevastopol harbor. Ukrainian Defense Ministry officials say that Russian forces have ordered them to surrender the ship and another an anti-submarine warship by 5am Tuesday. Pictured above on Monday . Ukrainian seamen stand guard on the Ukrainian navy ship Slavutich at harbor of  Sevastopol, Ukraine, which has allegedly been ordered to surrender by Russian forces .

'Not true': Russian authorities deny that naval forces have ordered the surrender of the two Ukrainian warships. Above, Ukrainian seaman stand guard aboard the Slavutich on Monday . Watching and waiting: People stand on board the Ukrainian navy corvette Ternopil at harbor of  Sevastopol, Ukraine on Monday . Back at the White House, Mr Obama said he believes Russia is on the wrong side of history, and should prepare itself for the consequences if it decides to proceed with military action in Crimea. 'But what cannot be done is for Russia, with impunity, to put its soldiers on the ground and violate basic principles that are recognized around the world,' Obama said. 'And I think the strong condemnation it's received from countries around the world indicates the degree to which Russia's on the wrong side of history in this.' President Obama said he is currently looking into ways to 'isolate' Russia including economic sanctions and restrictions on travel for Russian officials. 'What we are also indicating to the Russians is, if, in fact, they continue on trajectory that they're on, that we are examining a whole series of steps — economic, diplomatic — that will isolate Russia. and will have a negative impact on Russia's economy and its status in the world,' President Obama said. He is also calling on Congress to approve an aid package for the Ukrainian government. A united front on Ukraine: Secretary of State John Kerry (left) and Vice President Joe Biden (right) listen to President Obama's talk with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday at the White House . 'One thing they can do right away is work with the administration to help provide a package of assistance to Ukraine, to the people, to the government,' Mr Obama said. 'At this stage, there should be unanimity among Democrats and Republicans … We should be able to come up with a unified position that stands outside of partisan politics. My expectation is that I'll be able to able to get Congress to work with us in order to be able to achieve that goal.' But allies such as France believe there are few options beyond that. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said Russia's control of Crimea would not be easy to resolve. President Obama's latest comments come as he meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House this week. Tomorrow, Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Kiev, where he will further relay Mr Obama's message of Ukrainian sovereignty. The president spoke with Putin on Friday for 90 minutes, but his Russian counterpart did not  take Mr Obama's advice to stay out of the region. So far the U.S. has suspended prep meetings for the upcoming G-8 Summit in Sochi, Russia and declined to send a delegation to the Paralympic Winter Games - also in Sochi.

Antonio Gleidson Rodrigues, 32, the self-proclaimed number one Michael Jackson impersonator in Brazil, has had rhinoplasty in order to imitate the King Of Pop and spends around four hours each day rehearsing his dance moves. Gleidson Jackson, as he likes to be known, had his first operation five years ago when he had his nasal septum corrected to allow him to reach higher notes when singing. Antonio Gleidson Rodrigues, the self-proclaimed number one Michael Jackson impersonator in Brazil, has used acid to lighten his skin and spent £2,000 to look like his hero. He is pictured, right, without his make-up in 2009 . He said: 'I wasn't able to reach notes like Michael before but after surgery I can now sing some notes in falsetto.' Following his first bid at surgery, Gliedson, of Fortalenza, continued in his mission to imitate the world famous pop star by having hyaluronic acid injected into his face, which had a whitening effect, and botox injections to enhance the area under his eyes. The former drama teacher also had surgery to close the gaps in his teeth and his eyebrows tattooed. Gliedson is now hoping to raise enough money by imitating Jackson to have even more surgery. He said: 'If I can afford it in the future, I am thinking of working on my cheekbones so I can get rid of the wrinkles along my mouth - I also want to have my eyebrows arched. 'I would like to have my forehead tattooed and have my nose made even slimmer.' Gleidson Jackson, as he likes to be known, spends about one and a half hours applying make up before showtime . The impersonator also spends around four hours each day rehearsing his dance moves . He was encouraged to become a Michael Jackson impersonator when he was just 19 after his drama students suggested he looked like the pop star. He said: 'It was tough, they teased me for around 15 days and the mothers of the children even got involved. 'By the end of it I was caught up - I had the bug.' Gleidson now says his act and the dedication he has put into improving it is the greatest tribute he can pay to his idol. He said: 'In my concerts I always say that no copy will ever be as good as the original. 'But I can always say that I will always try my best to achieve perfection - just like Michael.' Gleidson, pictured relaxing at his home, was encouraged to become a Michael Jackson impersonator when he was just 19 after his drama students suggested he looked like the pop star . The former drama teacher now says his act and the dedication he has put into improving it is the greatest tribute he can pay to his idol . His aunt Maria Doriane Bastos de Souza, however, worries about the  impersonator. She said: 'He is obsessed, sometimes he will spend hours on the internet looking for things related to Michael Jackson. 'I worry for his health - I want him to come downstairs and eat a sandwich. 'I also worry when he goes into surgery, I never want him to feel disappointed and sometimes surgery doesn't work out the way you would want it to.' Jackson's death in June 2009 rocked the world but there were few who felt it quite as much as Gleidson. Gleidson's aunt Maria Doriane Bastos de Souza, worries about the impersonator, saying he is 'obsessed'. Gleidson is pictured, right, with his mother in June this year . He said: 'My reaction was absurd - I started to cry right away, I still don't understand how this could have happened to Michael Jackson. 'He was a guy who used to drink juice and avoid energy drinks - how could he have died of an overdose. 'In my opinion, to lose that man - the greatest artist of all times - is a real tragedy for the world.

A popular Jeep off-roader favoured by thousands of British school-run families is at the centre of a major fire safety row after U.S. officials blamed it for more than 50 deaths. Car bosses have refused U.S. government demands to recall nearly three million of the 4X4s over 'deadly problems'. Defiant Chrysler is refusing to recall about 2.7 million of the Jeeps which safety officials says are at risk of a fuel tank fire in a rear-end collision. The siting of the 4X4s fuel tank is a 'defect' which poses an 'unreasonable risk to safety,' say safety chiefs – a charge which Chrysler rejects. Some 23,511 of the Jeep Grand Cherokees made between 1993 and 2004 are still on the road in the UK . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has now sent Chrysler a letter asking that the company voluntarily recall Jeep Grand Cherokees - which were also sold in Britain – between 1993  and 2004. Some 23,511 of the Jeep Grand Cherokees from this period are still on the road in the UK, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and traders. The recall request also affects the Jeep Liberty built between 2002 and 2007, which was not sold in the UK. NHTSA found at least 32 rear-impact crashes and fires in Grand Cherokees that caused 44 deaths. It also found at least five rear crashes in Libertys, causing seven deaths. The fire row between Chrysler, its parent company Fiat, and government safety chiefs was the lead item on prime time news broadcasts in the U.S., including ABC News. Chrysler Group LLC, which is now majority-owned by Italy's Fiat SpA insisted in a statement on Tuesday that the Jeeps are safe and it 'does not intend to recall the vehicles'. Such a refusal by a car company is rare. And though the NHTSA can order a recall but needs a court order to enforce it. David Strickland, the safety agency's administrator, said in a statement that he hopes Chrysler will reconsider its decision. Will it be recalled? The 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited . Chrysler Group LLC, which is now majority-owned by Italy's Fiat SpA insisted in a statement on Tuesday that the Jeeps are safe . 'Our data shows that these vehicles may contain a defect that presents an unreasonable risk to safety,' he said. U.S. car safety chiefs opened an investigation into the Jeeps in August 2010 at the request of the Center for Auto Safety in Washington. They found that the Jeeps' fuel tanks can fail when hit from the rear, leak fuel and cause fires if there's an ignition source. The positioning of the tanks behind the rear axle and their height above the road is a design defect,  it said in a letter to Chrysler dated Monday. Chrysler moved the fuel tanks on the Grand Cherokee ahead of the rear axle in 2005, and did the same thing with the Liberty in 2007. NHTSA said the older Jeeps performed poorly when compared with all but one similar vehicle from the 1993 to 2007 model years: 'Particularly in terms of fatalities, fires without fatalities, and fuel leaks in rear-end impacts and crashes.' The agency calculated that the older Grand Cherokees and Libertys have fatal crash rates that are about double those of similar vehicles. It asks Chrysler to recall the vehicles and 'implement a remedy action that improves their performance in rear-impacts and crashes'. Car-makers  usually agree to a recall request, partly to avoid bad publicity. In the last three years, Chrysler has conducted 52 recalls. But Chrysler insists  its review of nearly 30 years of data shows a low number of rear-impact crashes involving fire or a fuel leak in the affected Jeeps and that the the recall request  is based on an 'incomplete analysis of the underlying data'. Chrysler Group LLC chairman and chief executive Sergio Marchionne insisted: 'The company stands behind the quality of its vehicles. 'All of us remain committed to continue working with NHTSA to provide information confirming the safety of these vehicles.' The row comes as Chrysler prepares to launch the latest new generation of its Jeep Grand Cherokee which is unaffected by the safety scare. 'NHTSA seems to be holding Chrysler Group to a new standard for fuel tank integrity that does not exist now and did not exist when the Jeep vehicles were manufactured,' the company said. The dispute leaves owners of the affected Grand Cherokees and Libertys waiting for government or court action. It also leaves Chrysler open to the risk of big liability if there are more crashes and injuries linked to the fuel tanks, said Logan Robinson, a University of Detroit Mercy law professor and former Chrysler corporate counsel. Lawyers could argue that if Chrysler had recalled the Jeeps, people wouldn't have been hurt, he said. But that liability would be limited if Chrysler beats NHTSA in court and a judge rules the company didn't sell defective vehicles, said Robinson. Chrysler called the older Grand Cherokees and Libertys 'among the safest vehicles of their era'  saying they met all federal safety standards in effect when they were built. NHTSA's letter concedes this but adds: 'The existence of a minimum standard does not require NHTSA to ignore deadly problems.' Chrysler has until June 18 to respond to the safety administration's letter. NHTSA has the authority to fine companies if slow to provide data or recall vehicles. The agency fined Toyota Motor Corp. a record $66million for failing to quickly report problems and for delaying a recall. Toyota paid the fine without admitting it violated the law.","Car bosses refuse demands to recall nearly three million 4X4s .

ff9a0c90d769d01144815ad388e194613e73da2f,"Zintan, Libya (CNN) -- In all his years in power, Moammar Gadhafi has never been portrayed as anything but regal in paintings and statues scattered throughout Libya. Until now. Six months into Libya's war, some artists in rebel strongholds are arming themselves with fresh paint. Their belief? A brush can be as mighty as the Kalashnikov in the fight against the strongman. ""Everybody supports the revolution in some way,"" says Mohammed Zamoul, formerly a bulldozer driver. ""Some people fight, I use the brush."" In Tripoli, a massive mural of Gadhafi remains intact. Zamoul's work is far less flattering. His caricatures of Gadhafi sucking on his country's oil reserves, pinned down by a rebel flag and being launched out of Libya on a bomb -- are everywhere around his hometown of Rujban in the country's western mountains. ""Building owners welcome it,"" he says. ""Not one single person said no. I get a lot of support."" Several miles away in the rebel-controlled city of Zintan, Masoud Baji is also using art as weapon. He was a calligrapher before the uprising began in Libya last February. Now, he revels in his new career. Each of his paintings, he says, expresses Gadhafi's persecution of the Libyan people. One portrays Gadhafi as a vampire sucking the wealth of the people. ""He has not left anything for them, he kept us illiterate, without education,"" Baji says. ""He kept everything for himself."" Some of the paintings are humorous. Some make strong political commentary. All are new in a nation where freedom of expression was an unknown under Gadhafi. ""Now we can express ourselves freely, thank god,"" Baji says. ""The chains have been lifted. Everyone can express themselves. Even a simple painting about the tyrant, now we can paint. Before the revolution we could not do that, he would arrest and in some cases kill us."" Zamoul and his assistant, calligrapher Abdul Aziz, bear sizzling daytime temperatures to create their latest fresco -- ""The Lady of the Sea"" beckoning rebel fighters to come and join her in Tripoli. ""What I have inside I can now express and put it on the walls,"" Zamoul says. In this particular expression, he has, perhaps, captured the heart of the Libyan rebels, fighting bitterly to make it Tripoli.","Political art is springing up in rebel-held areas of Libya .

Evil: Clappison, pictured outside Hull Crown Court today, was said by a judge to have 'blighted the lives of her children' A mother who abused her two children and kept them locked in bedrooms that were so cold her son caught frostbite was jailed for 18 months yesterday. Over a five-year period they were beaten, starved, forced to do manual labour instead  of going to school, given cold baths and shut up in the dark. Both children had to sleep in their underwear without bedding or a mattress in an unheated room, Hull Crown Court was  told during Linda Clappison’s cruelty trial. However, the 46-year-old mother managed to fool social workers by getting out toys and snacks  during a visit, and ‘made it look like happy families’. Son Andrew Clappison told the court he endured the living hell between the ages of ten and 16 and even attempted suicide. The daughter, who is now 13 and who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered similar treatment between the ages of six and 11. She also had her head shaved five times by her mother and was ordered to lie about it being her own idea ‘because she wanted to look like Britney Spears’. Mother-of-four Clappison, of Keyingham, East Yorkshire, was convicted of child cruelty last month. The treatment came to light when the girl went to school and told teachers she did not want to go home to her mother. Passing sentence yesterday, Judge Michael Mettyear paid tribute to the young victims, who he described as ‘the sort of children that any parent would admire’. He told Clappison: ‘Custody is inevitable. You have blighted the lives of these children.’ Andrew, 18, told the court he was ten when his mother changed after his father left home because she had had an affair. His elder brother and sister also left when the abuse started. He was kept off school half of the time but, when he did go, as soon as he returned home he was locked in his dark bedroom. Andrew said his mother punched, slapped and kicked him, beat him with a leather belt and banged his head against a wall for no reason. House of hell: The semi-detached house in Keyingham, East Yorkshire . where Linda Clappison subjected her children to a 'living hell' The worst punishment, he said, was being given a cold bath and dunked under the water. He said: ‘I was scared of her. I had to have my tea in my room. She would not let me come downstairs. I was treated like a dog.' Abused: Andrew Clappison, now 18, was beaten and starved by his mother from the age of 10 to 16, and even attempted suicide. In January 2010, Clappison removed his mattress when she caught him trying to keep warm under it. Toys and the lightbulb were also taken out. He said: ‘I was sleeping in the cold all the time.

She spent some of the cash on breast reduction surgery and designer shoes . A woman who stole from her employers and spent some of the cash on breast reduction surgery and designer shoes has been jailed for two years and three months this morning. Amanda Mann, an estate agent lettings manager, of Rhuddlan, near Rhyl, Wales, denied 17 charges of theft involving £7,500 but was previously convicted by a jury. The prosecution alleged that she had been responsible for stealing a far larger amount - in the region of £90,000. The judge, Mr Recorder Timothy Petts, told her today that he was convinced that she had stolen more than the amount in the charges, but it was impossible to say how much. The trial heard how Mann, 43, spent money on Jimmy Choo shoes and on breast reduction surgery at a cost of £6,000. Mold Crown Court was told today that she still denied any thefts, protested her innocence, and blamed others for taking the money. Mann worked for Fletcher and Poole estate agents at Conwy and was promoted to lettings manageress ten years ago. Most tenants paid in cash and Mann dealt with banking. She’d been regarded as a friend by her employer but there had been 'systematic siphoning off of money' which should have gone to the company. Application fees paid by tenants had been stolen, commission fees paid by landlords hadn’t been passed on, and deposit payments had also vanished. Mann had been suspended then sacked in 2011 and police called in. Bank statements showed Mann had £17,000 debts but periodically deposited large sums of cash. She had lived in a flat above the office and paid £300-a-month rent in cash. Owen Edwards, defending, said that his client had settled a £5,000 personal injury claim which could be used for compensation and said if she was allowed her liberty more money could be paid over from her earnings. He suggested that the inevitable prison sentence could be suspended because his client, a woman of good character, suffered from depression. There had also been huge delays in the case being dealt with, he added. Fletcher and Poole Estate Agents, where Mann was the lettings manager. The thefts took place over three-and-a-half years . But Mr Recorder Timothy Petts told Mann that it had to be immediate custody. He said that it was a small, family-run, friendly firm where everyone was trusted in the handling of cash. 'Over a period of time you systematically abused that trust and treated cash receipts as your own,' he said. It was a breach of 'a high degree of trust' where she was the manager, it went on over a three and a half year period, when she 'systematically and deliberately' stole from her employer. It was only brought to an end when she was caught. She had tried to cover her tracks and disguise what was happening and blamed others by making 'wild allegations' which were entirely false. The offences had caused considerable damage to the business and its reputation and her thieving continued when others were being made redundant and when the owner was undergoing cancer treatment, he said. 'This was a considerable period of thieving. Only immediate custody is appropriate,' he said.","Amanda Mann may have stolen up to £90,000, a court heard .

ff9ad312d23755b97b89b6efc7aa912cd51e8d7d,"Thousands of tech, finance, and manufacturing companies have secret agreements with U.S. security agencies to swap sensitive data in return for classified intelligence, sources have claimed. U.S. intelligence organizations, including the NSA, CIA and FBI and branches of the U.S. military, call the firms 'trusted partners', sources told Bloomberg. The sources either worked for the government or for the companies. A former NSA employee said the programs are far greater than what was uncovered by whistleblower Edward Snowden, who lifted the lid on government surveillance programs before fleeing to Hong Kong last month. More revelations: Sources have claimed that government agencies, including the NSA, FBI and CIA, have secret partnerships with large businesses to hand over sensitive information . The relationship between the companies, which include Microsoft and McAfee, and intelligence agencies is legal, and because the firms provide information voluntarily, there is no need for court orders to insist they hand over the information, a source said. The companies are happy to participate . in the agreements because they believe they are helping . to protect the nation or are advancing their own interests by . receiving classified information in return, sources said. They added that the public would be shocked at how much help the government seeks from the companies. Bloomberg explained that Microsoft hands over information on bugs in its software before it publicly reveals a way to fix the problem. The delay means that the U.S. government can exploit  vulnerabilities in Microsoft's system in programs that were sold abroad, including to foreign governments, the sources said. Explosive: The sources said programs extend far beyond the reach of what was revealed by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden (pictured), who leaked information about surveillance programs . While Microsoft is reportedly not told how the information is used, spokesman Frank Shaw . confirmed data was handed over to give the government 'an early start' on risk assessment and mitigation. Security software company McAfee also cooperates with the NSA, CIA, and FBI, the report explained, and shares data about malicious internet traffic, including foreign spy operations. 'We do not share any type of personal information with our government agency partners,' McAfee chief technology officer, Michael Fey, said. 'McAfee's function is to provide security technology, education, and threat intelligence to governments [including] emerging new threats, cyber-attack patterns and hacker group activity.' The agreements deal with such sensitive information that they are usually made strictly between companies' chief executive officers and chiefs of the U.S. agencies, the report said. Partner: Sources said that Microsoft will tell the government about bugs in its software before it tells the public so that the agencies can use the information to infiltrate foreign governments' systems . Only a few people in the company may know of them. Some U.S. telecommunications . companies also provide agencies with access to facilities and data . abroad that would require a judge's order if it were done in the U.S., . one source added. And in return for their help, companies are lavished with gratitude. 'If I were the director and had a relationship with a company who was doing things that were not just directed by law, but were also valuable to the defense of the Republic, I would go out of my way to thank them and give them a sense as to why this is necessary and useful,' said Michael Hayden, former director of the NSA and the CIA. The sources said that in return for the companies' help, some are also given warnings about threats that could affect their business, such as serious Internet attacks and who is responsible. Insistent: Earlier this week, Keith Alexander, director of the NSA, defended the programs as 'critical' to national security. Sources said companies also believe they are helping the nation . The report is just the latest revelation in the NSA leaks scandal, which hit headlines after Edward Snowden released information about Prism, an NSA surveillance system that gathers phone call and email information from telecommunication and internet companies. Since his reveal, Snowden has fled to Hong Kong, but his exact whereabouts are unknown. He emerged briefly in an interview with the South China Morning Post to claim that the U.S. has also been hacking Chinese computers for as long as four years.","U.S intelligence organizations including the NSA, CIA and FBI 'have secret agreements with companies including Microsoft and McAfee'

ff9add1b037fe69b72f1cd7b9da70f89729fe4dd,"South Korean forensics officials say they are sure the body found in a plum orchard last month is Yoo Byung Eun, a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in connection to the fatal Sewol ferry crash that claimed nearly 300 lives. But the country's forensics service said there was no way to determine the cause of death of Yoo, 73, because of the decomposed state of the body. Officials said that fingerprint, dental and DNA evidence confirmed his identity. According to various tests conducted, Yoo was not poisoned or suffocated. They found no trace of poison or alcohol, said Lee Han-Young, head of the Central Legal Medical Center. There were no signs of external force that may have caused death, he added. Yoo had been wanted by South Korean authorities, as prosecutors believed he and his sons controlled the shipping company that operated the Sewol ferry that sank on April 16. Yoo's representatives denied this allegation. His supporters claimed that Yoo had been made into a scapegoat for the ferry tragedy. The sinking killed 294 people on board, including hundreds of high school students who were on a field trip. More than 100 days after the incident, divers are still searching for bodies. Ten people remain missing. Yoo was a religious figure of the Evangelical Baptist Church, which was founded by his father-in-law.  A spokesman for the group confirmed Yoo's death on Friday. It was still unclear when Yoo died. South Korean authorities had been under scrutiny for their inability to find the elusive billionaire despite a massive manhunt, involving 8,000 officers, in the weeks following the incident. Suggestions that police bungled the investigation prompted officers to hold Friday's press conference. The identification process took 40 days, after the body was found on June 12. Korean authorities performed two autopsies and the test results matched, Lee said. Yoo's body can now be turned over to his family, but the whereabouts of most of his children are not known.

ff9b97f9de72c114bce8f584a6572f79bbb1ac31,"(CNN) -- Kurbanjan Samat, a 32-year-old Uyghur photographer, wants to dispel the stereotypes he says many Chinese hold about people from his home region -- an ethnically diverse province in China's far west. He traveled to more than 20 cities to interview and photograph more than 500 people as part of a photography project called ""I'm from Xinjiang"" that aims to bridge the gap between China's Han majority and the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs at a time of heightened tensions between the two groups. Following the conviction of Uyghur extremists for a number of violent attacks in the past year, Samat told CNN that many Chinese outside Xinjiang increasingly associate the province with terrorism. ""The idea occurred to me to tell the real life stories of people from Xinjiang... and show that people from Xinjiang are no different from others,"" he said. A new book will showcase 100 of his best portraits. They include Nefise Nehmat, a Shanghai-based Uyghur lawyer, who is now studying for a master's degree in comparative law at a U.S. university and Zhang Zhiqiang, a Han Chinese adopted by a Uyghur family, who runs a mobile phone business and has converted to Islam. The subjects are shown in a variety of settings -- an office cubicle, praying, in a radio studio and at home, which Samat hopes will dispel a common perception that people from Xinjiang only run kebab stalls or restaurants. Most of the people he approached were willing to have their portraits taken, but some balked at the last minute. Samat, who is based in Beijing and started taking photos in middle school, says he, like other Uyghurs, has faced discrimination, particularly after knife-wielding assailants killed 31 people at train station in Kunming earlier this year -- an attack Chinese media referred to as the country's 9/11. ""During those days, I couldn't even get a cab because I have a face typical of Xinjiang people,"" he said. Samat doesn't expect his book to bring any significant changes but he hopes it will encourage others to understand the people from Xinjiang they encounter in their daily life. Ultimately, he says, he did the project ""not for Uyghurs, not for Xinjiang,"" but for himself. ""If I don't do this, the labels they put on Xinjiang people will be put on me. I don't want to be labeled."" CNN's Zhang Dayu reported from Beijing, Katie Hunt wrote from Hong Kong.","Uyghur photographer wants to dispel stereotypes about Xinjiang.

ff9ba1ee319ec944946d0301d1db213effc4fc79,"By . Reuters Reporter . Last updated at 9:42 PM on 16th February 2012 . The careworn house not far from Santa Monica Boulevard resembles millions of other homes that have been foreclosed on since the calamitous U.S. housing crash four years ago. Garbage spews from trash bags behind the property. A smashed television leans against broken furniture. A filthy toy dog lies on its side, an ear draped across its face. The garden is overgrown. The house needs a paint job. Yet the property on North Rexford Drive, Beverly Hills, California, is no ordinary foreclosure. FORECLOSED: This sprawling, Spanish-style estate is one of many foreclosures in Beverly Hills. Its former owners were $205,000 behind in their payments on mortgages totaling $6.9 million . A sprawling, Spanish-style estate, fringed by majestic pine trees and located near the boutiques of Santa Monica Boulevard, its former owners were served with a default notice in 2010; they were $205,000 behind in their payments on mortgages totaling $6.9 million. Welcome to foreclosure Beverly Hills-style. Some 180 houses in Beverly Hills, the storied Los Angeles enclave rich with Hollywood stars and music moguls, have been foreclosed on by lenders, scheduled for auction, or served with a default notice, the highest level since the 2008 financial crash, according to a Reuters analysis of figures compiled by RealtyTrac, which tracks foreclosures nationwide. As in the default-ravaged suburban subdivisions of Phoenix, Arizona, and Tampa, Florida, plunging real estate prices are the root of the problem in Beverly Hills. But the dynamics of the residential real estate collapse are very different in elite neighborhoods such as this. The majority of delinquent homeowners here owe more than $1 million. Many are walking away not because they can't pay, but because they judge it would be foolish to keep doing so. 'It's a business decision, not an emotional one which it is for normal people,' said Deborah Bremner, owner of the Bremner Group at Coldwell Banker, which specializes in high-end properties in the Los Angeles area. 'I go to cocktail parties and all people are talking about is whether it is time to walk away, although they will never be quoted in the real world.' The mansion, overgrown, abandoned and badly in need of a paint job, is one of 180 foreclosures in the wealthy Los Angeles enclave . She said she had seen in Beverly Hills a big increase in 'strategic defaults,' in which owners who can still afford to make their monthly mortgage payment choose not to because the property is now worth so much less than the giant loan used to buy it during the housing bubble. Strategic default is an especially appealing option in California, one of only a handful of U.S. states where primary mortgages made by banks are 'non-recourse' loans. That means the loan is secured solely by the property, and banks cannot go after a delinquent owner's wages or other assets if they default. Bremner said she helped a client buy a Beverly Hills mansion last year that the prior owner had bought for over $4 million. He decided to stop paying his $3 million mortgage - even though he could easily afford it - when the value of the property had dropped to $2.5 million. 'They were able to comfortably cover the loan,' Bremner said. 'They were just no longer willing to see the value of the property drop.' A huge 'shadow inventory' is building of elite homes that are in default but have not been put on the market. Of the 180 distressed properties in Beverly Hills, only 12 are up for sale. The backlog reflects the pent-up flood of foreclosed properties of all price ranges that are expected to hit the U.S. market this year, especially after five major banks reached a $25 billion settlement last week with the U.S. over fraudulent foreclosure practices. Default is a popular option in California as banks cannot go after other assets, only the property used to secure the loan. That is not the case in most states, including foreclosure ridden Florida, where the pictured home is located . Across the United States, the largest increase in foreclosures and delinquencies, compared with 2008 levels, is with 'jumbo' mortgages - loans too large to be insured by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government controlled mortgage finance providers. Foreclosures on jumbo loans are up 579 percent since 2008, greater than any other form of loan, according to a report last month by Lender Processing Services, Inc. Strategic defaults are now more likely among jumbo loan-holders than any other type of borrower, according to a report issued late last year by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Nearly 40 percent of delinquencies among non-governmental mortgages, which are mostly jumbo loans, are strategic defaults, the report said. 'Now that these homeowners with jumbo loans are finding out you can do this, more and more are doing strategic foreclosures,' said Jon Maddux the CEO of YouWalkAway.com, which advises homeowners who are 'underwater,' the term for those whose loans exceed the value of their home. Nathaniel J. Friedman, a Beverly Hills lawyer, insists he is not a strategic defaulter - that he never missed a mortgage payment in his life. But he stopped making payments on his five-bedroom, six-bathroom Beverly Hills house on Schuyler Road three years ago. Friedman, who had mortgages totaling $3 million with the now-defunct Countrywide Home Loans, returned home one evening in January 2009 to find a letter from Countrywide freezing his $150,000 line of credit, which was linked to his second $900,000 loan. His primary loan was $2.1 million. The property is worth about $2 million today. Friedman says he decided to stop paying out of a sense of vengeance from the moment he received that letter. He has been in negotiations for months with Bank of America, which took over Countrywide after its collapse, to modify the loan. 'I thought to hell with it,' he told Reuters. 'Why should I keep feeding a dead horse if the bank has no confidence in me?' 'I was able to maneuver things my way because of the inertia of the banking sector,' Friedman said. He believes the bank will blink first, and eventually modify his loan.","Majority of delinquent homeowners in Beverly Hills owe over $1million .

Tomas Suchy, 22, was helping colleagues re-stack a pile of boxes which had fallen over in the store room of Interfish in Plymouth, Devon, when the incident occurred. The Slovakian-born worker and three fellow employees had almost finished stacking the pallets in the stock room, where temperatures are -25C, when the pile gave way. Tomas Suchy, 22 (pictured), was helping colleagues re-stack a pile of pallets - each containing 52 boxes -which had fallen over in the store room of Interfish in Plymouth, Devon, when he was crushed by them falling . A co-worker sounded the alarm by shouting 'run away' but it was too late and Mr Suchy was killed instantly by 'catastrophic' head injuries caused by the falling boxes. The boxes weighed 25 kilos and there were 52 on each pallet. Mr Suchy, who studied architecture at university, was hit by a number of pallets and also suffered a number of other fatal injuries, the inquest into his death in Plymouth heard yesterday. Robert Lanjeckl, who had worked at Interfish for a year prior to the accident, told the inquest: 'We had nearly finished the work and then suddenly (a co-worker) was shouting ""run away"". 'The whole wall just fell over.' The inquest also heard from former employees of Interfish, who said it was not an isolated incident and criticised the company over its poor health and safety. Tom Reid, a former forklift-driver at Interfish said that he had been involved in a similar incident in the past, and suffered a shoulder injury from falling boxes of fish. He described the pallets as in 'pretty bad condition' and said that he had warned his manager of the dangers. He said: 'I told my manager: ""This is s***. It is dangerous"". 'He said: ""Do the best you can"" and to ""carry on"".' The Slovakian-born worker suffered 'catastrophic' head injuries after being crushed by pallets, which fell on top of him while he was trying to stack them at food-processing firm Interfish (pictured) in Plymouth, Devon . Emma O'Hara, a health and safety executive, said there was 'no robust monitoring' at the food processing firm. She told Mr Suchy's inquest: 'The boxes were stacked excessively high. Some of the stacks looked unstable and were leaning into one another. 'Some had not been placed directly on the one below and one stack was balanced on only two boxes of fish that weren't palletised. 'There were a number of damaged boxes and pallets. 'There was no safe system of work or instruction to staff. Safe checking relied on (experienced) staff working in the area.' After Mr Suchy's death, the food processing company was handed four prohibition notices and one improvement notice by the Health and Safety Executive. The firm complied with each and introduced a range of measures to ensure similar incidents do not occur. The legal representative for Interfish said: 'Everything the company was asked to do was done.'

Miss Quan, 27, was the daughter of a . former police captain, Randal Quan, who represented Dorner in his failed . appeal against his dismissal from the LAPD and who Dorner blamed for . bungling his case. On Wednesday night, after trying to . steal a boat to escape to Mexico, Dorner drove inland, shooting at . police officers at random. In the early hours of Thursday, he . shot at two officers assigned to protect one of his suspected targets in . Corona, California, grazing one in the head. Less than an hour later, . he pulled up next to a police car waiting at traffic lights in the . neighbouring town of Riverside and ambushed the officers inside with an . assault rifle.

ff9c6e92c2744de61c62f81ff43a6997d6598af6,"(CNN) -- Syrian opposition groups said Saturday that they have formed a breakaway government, but many details were yet to emerge. The Local Coordination Committees, which organizes and documents protests against the Syrian regime, said 188 seats have so far been assigned to the council, but it may be 24 hours before the announcement of a presidential body. Groups including the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria, the Revolution Forces, the Public Council for Revolution Forces and the Superior Council of the Revolution have all joined the LCC in the opposition government, the LCC said Saturday. The groups are trying to create a Syrian National Council aimed at toppling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Syria has been locked in a violent months-long uprising that has seen security forces clash with anti-government protesters calling for free elections and the end of al-Assad's rule. Activists said at least eight people died in protests and random shootings on Saturday, a day after the government said 13 security forces and three civilians died in clashes and an opposition group said 23 people, mostly civilians, died in the fighting. Activists also said women marched near the presidential palace in Damascus on Saturday, demanding the fall of the regime, the release of detainees and the lifting of blockades throughout the country. CNN is unable to independently confirm the claims. Al-Assad, who has characterized the protesters as ""armed gangs,"" has insisted his security forces are battling terrorists intent on targeting civilians and fomenting unrest. The United States, the European Union and a number of Arab countries have called an al-Assad to end the crackdown and step down. Tensions between the United States and Syria escalated after the Syrian ambassador to the U.S. was called Friday to the State Department over an attempted attack a day earlier in Damascus on American Ambassador Robert Ford, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters. ""The ambassador was reminded that Ambassador Ford is the personal representative of the president, and an attack on Ford is an attack on the United States,"" Nuland said. About 100 pro-government protesters tried to storm a meeting between Ford and opposition leader Hassan Abdelazim, trapping Ford and others for more than an hour. Later, his convoy was attacked. The al-Assad regime had earlier accused Washington of inciting ""armed groups"" into violence against its security forces. Nuland said Ambassador Imad Mustapha was asked to compensate the United States for damage to the vehicles. In a Facebook post Friday, Ford said he respected ""peaceful protest"" -- including by pro-government factions to express their opposition to him and U.S. policy -- but insisted that Thursday's incident was ""not peaceful."" He described demonstrators wielding iron bars; throwing tomatoes, eggs and concrete blocks; attacking embassy vehicles; and trying to break into Azim's office. ""Americans understand that we are seeing the ugly side of the Syrian regime, which uses brutal force, repression and intimidation to stay in power,"" Ford wrote. ""We deeply feel for the Syrian families that are enduring the violence, killings and torture and pain. We hope that Syrians find solutions to the crisis soon, but we strongly doubt that the regime's terrorizing the population will end the crisis."" Syrian state-run media, citing the Foreign Ministry, reported Friday that ""necessary measures"" had been taken to protect Ford. Taking a page from the success of Libya's National Transitional Council, Syrian opposition groups meeting in Istanbul worked together to bring the various groups under one opposition umbrella. Among those expected to be represented by the National Council are the Muslim Brotherhood, the Assyrian Organization and the General Authority of the Syrian Revolution, the LCC said. The LCC does not identify its membership out of a fear of reprisals by al-Assad's security forces. CNN cannot independently verify the claims of the group because the Syrian government has denied international journalists access to the country. The meeting concluded the same day news broke that prominent anti-government activist Marwa al-Ghemyan was detained Friday by Syrian security forces at the Damascus airport. Al-Ghemyan was detained as she was preparing to depart the capital and taken to a military security building, the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a statement. The opposition group, which documents Syria's anti-government movement, did not say how it confirmed her detention. Al-Ghemyan was previously detained by Syrian forces on March 4 and released on March 21, the group said. CNN's Elise Labott, Hamdi Alkhshali and Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: Syrian opposition say they have formed breakaway government council .

ff9cc7656670d601db14b4a757ab74961698caab,"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- More than a dozen uncontained wildfires raged Monday across Southern California, threatening thousands of structures and forcing people to flee homes from San Diego to Malibu to Lake Arrowhead. This photo taken from space Monday afternoon shows smoke rising from the wildfires in Southern California. Fire officials said more than 265,000 people have been evacuated and nearly 4,900 firefighters are battling the fast-moving blazes, which began over the weekend. By Monday afternoon, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention had reported 13 active wildfires have consumed more than 98,000 acres and destroyed or damaged at least 50 homes and businesses across six counties. The winds driving the flames are expected to stay strong, coming out of the northeast, at least through Tuesday, according to CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano. ""It's a tragic time for California,"" California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said earlier Monday. He declared a state of emergency in seven counties and asked the National Guard to pull 800 soldiers from patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border to help battle the wildfires. Monday evening, Schwarzenegger asked U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates to order delivery of all available Modular Airborne Fire Fighting Systems (MAFFS) to help fight the fires.  Watch fires devour homes and land » . Citing the proliferation in the number of fires, Schwarzenegger wrote, ""Your immediate assistance is necessary to deploy Department of Defense aircraft located in Wyoming, North Carolina and Colorado to assist California in our firefighting effort."" According to the White House, the federal Agriculture Department will provide fire crews, air tankers and helicopters to fight the fires, and the state will receive assistance grants to help pay firefighting costs.  See where fires burn across Southern California » . Hardest hit was San Diego County, where 250,000 people have fled from five fires. One person was killed and 18 were reported injured in the county, including five firefighters. Local officials said the fire situation had worsened throughout the day, prompting new evacuations. ""We have a very dangerous, unpredictable situation,"" said Ron Roberts, chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. ""We have some of the highest temperatures, some of the driest landscape conditions and some of the most powerful winds -- all the ingredients for a perfect firestorm."" On one cul-de-sac in the San Diego suburb of  Rancho Bernardo, five of six homes burned to the ground, leaving flames from gas lines flickering amid the ruins, according to a KGTV report.  See photos of the fires » . Officials turned Qualcomm Stadium, home of the NFL's San Diego Chargers, into an evacuation center. Residents of four housing areas at the Camp Pendleton Marine base in northern San Diego County were put on notice for possible evacuations and told to pack personal belongings as a precautionary measure. Earlier Monday, fixed-wing firefighting aircraft were grounded by the strong winds, officials said, making the jobs of fire crews on the ground even harder. Fires threatened the San Diego Zoo's Wild Animal Park on Monday, causing the park to close. Some of the animals, such as endangered condors, are being moved to a safer location, according to zoo spokeswoman Yadira Galindo. Authorities are asking people to hold off on 911 calls unless there is a real emergency, saying clogged cell phone lines are hurting rescue efforts. The largest of the wildfires was the Buckweed blaze north of Los Angeles, which has consumed 27,500 acres and forced the evacuation of 15,000 residents from Santa Clarita and nearby communities, according to the state forestry department. About 4,000 structures were threatened, and the fire was moving toward the Magic Mountain amusement park. Two fires that erupted Monday morning in San Bernardino County near Lake Arrowhead have destroyed at least 123 structures and charred 1,800 acres, said Loretta Benavidez, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino National Forest. Several communities in the area, including Green Valley Lake, Arrowbear and Running Springs, were evacuated. And in Malibu Canyon, south of the Pacific Coast Highway, nearly 1,450 firefighters were battling a blaze that began Sunday afternoon and still threatened 900 structures in the area, which is home to many Hollywood luminaries, the state forestry department said. The Canyon fire is only 10 percent contained, an official said. The Pacific Coast Highway remains shut down in Malibu. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

Creating water from thin air may seem a tall order - but US researchers have unveiled a system that could bring drinking water to remote areas. MIT researchers have developed a special mesh that can extract the water from morning fog, channeling it into reservoirs. They have already trialled the system in Chile, and say it could have a dramatic impact on the lives of remote communities. Scroll down for video . One of the fences already installed in Chile. The special mesh can extract the water from morning fog, channeling it into reservoirs. By changing the size of the holes and fibres, researchers say they have already improved the system by 500% . Fences made from a simple system of suspended mesh structures are placed on hilltops in areas with persistent fog and prevailing westerly winds. When the fog arrives, the water condenses in the mesh and drip down pipes to water butts, where is can be fed directly into watering systems or used by locals as drinking water. Variations in the mesh spacing as well as the size and the wettability of the fibers in the mesh all affect the volume of water that can be collected each day. Researchers at MIT's School of Engineering, working with colleagues at the Pontificial University of Chile in Santiago, are harvesting potable water from the coastal fog that forms on the edge of one of the driest regions on earth. Using a simple system of suspended mesh structures, placed on hilltops in areas with persistent fog and prevailing westerly winds, local Chilean communities collect fog water for drinking and agricultural use. 'This water has been naturally desalinated by the sun, we are trying to build meshes to capture it straight out of the air,' said Gareth McKinley of MIT, who is leading the project. Fog collecting technology is still in its infancy but laboratory experiments have shown that variations in the mesh spacing as well as the size and the wettability of the fibers in the mesh all affect the volume of water that can be collected each day. The fences feed into water reservoirs . The researchers created dozens of lab systems to test different types of mesh . 'By changing the size of the holes and fibres, we've improved the system by 500%' Regions were the system has been installed have alreasy seen major changes. Former fisherman have turned into farmers because of fog water, the team said. 'The technology holds great promise as a locally deployable and scalable alternative to other energy-intensive desalination technologies,' MIT said. 'Mesh-based Fog Harvesters are passive, inexpensive to fabricate, with close to zero operating costs, and can be deployed in similar environments throughout the world.' There's approx 10bn m2 of fog water in Chilean cloud, 4% of that will provide drinking water for an entire year, the team say.","Mesh can extract water from fog .

ff9d44524f810c5ed4d2ce35de0d0d0377cadff2,"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- Jazz, soul and a blend of rock and roll combine to make Senegalese music sound quite familiar, while the sound of the sabar, a traditional Senegalese drum, keeps the music true to its West African roots. I'm listening to the mbalax style of music for my latest ""Inside Africa"" assignment: to experience the special sounds of Senegal. Without a doubt, the biggest name in Senegalese drumming is Doudou N'Diaye Rose. He's almost mythical; every person I interviewed spoke of him as the ""sabar master."" With more than forty children and an untold number of grandkids, he's been performing since the 1930's, gradually crafting the unique rhythm of this part of the world -- literally with his bare hands. Meeting the legend was not what I expected. At 82 years old he has a small frame and is such a humble person. When we arrived at one of his homes, he was more concerned with our crew eating breakfast than showing off his many accomplishments. Doudou has performed with the Rolling Stones, Miles Davis, at the Cannes Film Festival and has been declared by UNESCO as a ""living human treasure."" Most of his children learned from him, playing in a traveling orchestra. Even his female grandchildren formed a group, practicing on the rooftop. However, when Dakar's chief drum major -- who is draped in an elaborate Grand Boubou print -- steps behind his wide array of drums, modesty leaves the room. The beats are complex, quickly changing from soft, rapid taps of the finger tips and palm to loud strikes by the galan, or stick. Strings pull the shaved goatskin surface tight and, by twisting a series of cylindrical pegs, each drum can be tuned just like a guitar. Doudou explains that what I'm hearing is more than music -- it's a beautiful language reminiscent of his childhood in the Plateau district. A time when certain types of drums would be used to communicate certain ideas; calm, joyful messages for wedding ceremonies, or exciting, encouraging sounds for young men heading off to battle. See also: Senegal island exposes horrors of the slave trade . Today, younger Senegalese artists are taking the Doudou sound and modernizing it. He often appears as a special guest on stage with artists like Coumba Gawlo -- currently one of the best selling female singers in the country. When I watched her performing, she was serenading crowds in the local language of Wolof, belting out the mbalax sound as she was being lowered in a golden cage onto a smoke-filled stage. But even next to a curvaceous woman wearing a sparkling dress, Doudou holds his own -- an octogenarian with as much stage presence as a pop star. From inside a lively recording studio elsewhere in town I find more local artists who cite Doudou as their inspiration. Daara J Family is a group made up of Faada Freddy and Ndongo D, plus the support of drummers, electric guitar players and a keyboardist. The sound is eclectic; I can hear Jamaican reggae influences in their beats and in Ndongo D's fast rapping style. Faadda Freddy tells me that in songs like ""Bayi Yoon,"" they pull from the South African vocal tradition, essentially sampling from every place they've toured. Local history is important to them as well. On Daara J Family's second album they included a song about Senegal's Goree Island as a modern way of discussing the trans-Atlantic slave trade. But mostly, the group is optimistic and forward-looking. Ndongo D explains to me that while they pull from the Doudou-created Senegalese sound they want to include more aspects of music in the African diaspora because ""we all came from Africa, and then went to different horizons to settle."" Their aim is to connect with people globally. See also: Beach life gives a taste of real Senegal . On this journey of discovery, it's becoming more apparent to me that music has been a powerful form of communication, expression and family bonding in Senegal. Getting to a place of a strong, almost spiritual connection is what mbalax is really about - even though it might sound quite foreign to many of us. It was a privilege to meet Doudou (and even get a personal lesson in drumming), wonderful to see traditional music get a contemporary twist, and eye-opening to see West African artists reaching out to the rest of the world. Faada Freddy summed up my impressions best: ""Being African is not a matter of color -- it's about heart.""","Mbalax, combining jazz, soul, and rock with traditional beats, is the dance music of Senegal .

ff9e0bf5392f97df3ca7b6b3435e06829a270086,"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Afghanistan's reputation as the world's leading narcotics supplier is well-known, but in a squalid ruin in Kabul, the country hides a darker secret -- a huge home grown drug addiction problem now on the brink of fueling an HIV/AIDS epidemic. Junkies smoking heroin can get high for $4. Here junkies lie in their own filth, wasted limbs poking out of blood-spattered clothing as they blank out the abject misery of their surroundings. In one room, a veritable narcotics bazaar offers pills and drug paraphernalia -- with hits retailing at less than $4. One user claims he has been an addict for 22 years, although it is difficult to talk to any of the dazed and ragged occupants of the drug rooms. The atmosphere is edgy and -- as thick clouds of burning opium fill the air -- dizzyingly toxic. The Kabul den is just the tip of the iceberg in a country awash with narcotics. The government estimates the number of addicts in Afghanistan could be as many as five percent of its 25 million people.  Watch Nic Robertson's report from the 'house of hopelessness' » . And though nascent efforts are being made to tackle the problem, chronic funding shortfalls have prompted the United Nations to warn that drug use will escalate, potentially driving an HIV/AIDS crisis as junkies move from smoking to high risk needle-sharing. Afghanistan has always been a major narcotics supplier -- responsible for 95 percent of the world's heroin -- although this was scaled back under the rule of the Taliban, which outlawed poppy cultivation and imposed strict penalties for drug users. Since 2001, when the extremist regime was ousted by a U.S.-led invasion that installed President Hamid Karzai, production has doubled. And for many in the country still mired in poverty and conflict, these cheap drugs offer a tempting escape. The last United Nations survey of Afghanistan's drug problem four years ago estimated the country's addicts to number about 200,000. According to Afghan Counter Narcotics Minister Khodaidad, the figure is now far greater. ""More than 1.2 million people in Afghanistan are addicts. It's a very huge number and every year it increases,"" he told CNN. Khodaidad says the Afghan government is largely powerless to control the production of opium while Taliban extremists, who now control and draw funding from drug crops, control cultivation areas despite major international military efforts to push them back. ""We did very little due to weakness of governors, due to insurgents, due to pressure of terrorism in the area,"" he added. ""We don't have sufficient law enforcement agencies -- the police, the border security force, and other special forces to control this area -- so it will take time."" But, says Jean-Luc Lemahieu, head of the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in Kabul, time is something Afghanistan does not have. As intravenous drug use takes hold, raising the prospect of needle sharing, he says HIV/AIDS will follow quickly. ""The little data we have at the moment are very alarming,"" he told CNN. ""They tell us that we should not wait longer and if not, this country will be saddled with another burden it just can not afford. ""I think it is already happening today. We have seen, now, a few HIV/AIDS cases. Hopefully we can contain the problem, although it is unlikely given the problems with the health structures."" The U.N. has begun a program to detox users willing to get off drugs in Afghanistan. A renovated warehouse in Kabul offers hope to 100 addicts in the biggest facility of its kind in the country.  Watch Robertson go inside the detox clinic » . In the center's clean, bare rooms, shaven-headed junkies tremble under blankets as they go through the agonizing cold turkey of weaning their ravaged bodies off drug dependency. Therapy sessions also help motivate them to kick their deadly habit. ""Here we deal with the problem from a humanitarian perspective, not from an addiction perspective, to save lives,"" says Jehan Zeb Khan, UNODC program manager. But says Khan, with what little funding there is now dwindling fast, the salvation offered to these lucky few may be short lived -- they will be forced back out on the streets, where more opium dens will flourish, bringing yet more misery for Afghanistan.","Government officials say 1.2 million Afghans are now addicted to drugs .

A woman who famously pledged to 'spend, spend, spend' after winning big betting on football is holding a charity sale of memorabilia from her life. Viv Nicholson, 77, won £152,000 in 1961 alongside her husband Keith, and promptly used it all to buy expensive clothes, cars and houses. The win, on a football betting pool, in which gamblers predict the results of football games across a season, would be worth £2,870,000 today. Then and now: Viv Nicholson poses, left, with her husband Keith with their winnings in 1961, and, right with her brother Geoff Asprey today ahead of the auction of memorabilia from her life . Joy: Mrs Nicholson, centre, celebrates with her husband as Bruce Forsyth, right, presents their winnings . The couple frittered away half of their wealth within four years of winning. Mr Nicholson tragically died at the wheel of his blue Jaguar in 1965, which led to Mrs Nicholson being declared bankrupt, as the tax authorities reclaimed most of her husband's wealth. She managed to reclaim some after a lengthy legal battle, but lost it all again from poor investments on the stock market. Mrs Nicholson married three times more, though she is now a widow again, and battled with alcohol and depression. A shot-lived attempt to start a new life in Malta was soon curtailed after she was deported for fighting with a police officer. In desperation she took to performing 'Big Spender' in a Manchester strip club, but was fired when she refused to take off her underwear. In 1984, The Smiths asked her to pose for the cover of their hit single Heaven Knows I'm Miserable now. Glad rags: Mrs Nicholson's camel-coloured maxi coat, seen left and right, and her wide-rimmed blue hat, left, will be among the items at auction . Memorabilia: Mrs Nicholson and Mr Asprey will auction items from her left, pictured. The proceeds will help fund a project to buy iPads for the elderly . Hits: These records, recorded by Mrs Nicholson and her family, feature in the auction . Fashion show: Many of her vintage clothes, shown here on the catwalk in 2009, will be sold to raise money . Her story has had an enduring fascination, and was turned into a televised BBC play and later a West End musical - both called Spend, Spend, Spend. Mrs Nicholson received royalties of around £100,000 from the musical, which were spent, and revealed in an interview with the Daily Mail in 2007 that she was living off of her state pension and seeking work. Mrs Nicholson has suffered three strokes, and has now returned to her hometown of Castleford, Yorkshire, where she lives in a care home. Her brother Geoff Asprey, 71, who wrote a single entitled Spend, Spend, Spend based on her experiences, is now planning to auction off items from his sister's colourful life, which he has kept. The money will be used to buy iPads for the elderly so that they can stay in touch more easily. The pair have set up the Asprey Nicholson Foundation and plan to use some of the proceeds to form an 'e-village' and stay connected. Fame: Mrs Nicholson's life was immortalised in the musical Spend, Spend, Spend. It debuted on the West End in 1999, where Barbara Dickson, left, played Mrs Nicholson . Mr Asprey said: 'The object of the foundation is to buy iPads they can use in a sort of e-village and talk to each other the internet. We’re hoping to raise as much as we can. 'Viv’s a figure who stands there to show what can happen when you have got nobody when you are old.' The siblings are exhibiting the memorabilia at an empty unit at Carlton Lanes Shopping Centre in Castleford, and plan to hold the auction in the new year. Items on sale include photos of the two in their various club bands, along with microphone stands and other stage equipment, items from her home before the big win and even a drawing by Mrs Nicholson. Mr Asprey added: 'I wanted Castleford people to see what she has been left with. 'Viv doesn’t have anything herself, all these items are ones I’ve saved or collected over the years.'","Viv Nicholson, 77, won £152,000 in 1961 with her husband Keith .

A California man whose truck flipped over and crashed into a tree Thursday fled the scene, leaving his girlfriend trapped upside down in the vehicle. Police say 24-year-old Jon Holley was driving in Glen Ellen, California when he took a turn too quickly and overturned his 2006 Nissan Frontier. Holley was driving on a suspended license from a previous DUI and fled the scene, leaving his 23-year-old girlfriend Sada Washington behind, stuck in her seat belt. Chivalry is dead: Jon Holley, left, was still being sought by California Highway Patrol Sunday after police say he flipped his truck, leaving girlfriend Sada Washington, right, trapped inside . Washington pulled from the car by responders and taken to Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries. That night, Washington was understandably helpful with police in their search for Holley. However, her fury has evidently since cooled because she’s no longer aiding the California Highway Patrol in their investigation. ‘They’ve probably made amends,’ CHP Officer Nenad Gorenec told MailOnline. Not-so-perfect couple: Police say Holley, right, was driving on a suspended license Thursday night when he flipped the car and that he likely fled fearing the repercussions. Police also suspect he was driving under the influence . As of Sunday afternoon, Holley remained at large and faces a hit and run charge as well as possible DUI. Despite her unwillingness to help cops find Holley, she hinted at her annoyance over his distinct lack of chivalry in a Thursday post to Facebook. ‘Can I move now,’ she asked. She also hinted at their shared love of speed, writing back in May: . ‘Fast and Furious 6!!!!! Whooo!!!! -- feeling excited with Jon Holley Murphy.’ Meanwhile, Holley's most recent post--dated November 18--makes him sound surprisingly chivalrous: . 'Bare knuckle up an get your teeth nocked n tha dirt if your gonna flirt with my girlie.' Must have made up: While police say Washington was helpful at first, she is no longer aiding their investigation.

ff9f08dbf81ff48d3d12960a2d15f80c7a631574,"By . Emma Innes . A mother-of-two has a sleep condition which means she has fallen asleep next to loud speakers, on the back of a moped and even on the bus holding her newborn baby. Claire Metters, 38, from Conwy, North Wales, says she suffers with narcolepsy and faces a daily battle to stay awake for her children. She claims she must nap for four hours a day, on top of getting nine hours sleep at night, in order to function. Claire Metters, 38, has the sleep condition narcolepsy which means she faces a daily battle to stay awake for her children - Lucie, seven (right), and Aimee, 12 (left) Ms Metters said: ‘If I didn’t take my naps when the girls are at school I would fall asleep cooking them dinner, or tidying up.’ Ms Metters is no longer able to drive or work, as her body is too worn out and constantly needs to rest. Her day starts at 7am when she wakes up and helps her daughters Lucie, seven, and Aimee, 12, get ready for school. Claire then walks her younger daughter to the nearby school for 9am and by 9.30am she is back in bed, taking the first of her scheduled naps. She wakes herself up again at 11am and will go about her day, doing the housework, preparing food and supporting the charity Narcolepsy UK charity. By 1pm Ms Metters is ready to head back to bed for her next two-hour nap, and she sleeps until 3pm when she picks up Lucie from school. Ms Metters, who had to give up work because of her illness, has to nap for two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon to ensure she is awake for her children before and after school . For years doctors told Ms Metters that her symptoms were caused by stress before she was eventually diagnosed with narcolepsy after Aimee's birth . Ms Metters says she suffers with narcolepsy, a neurological condition which means although she sleeps a lot, she doesn’t get the restful sleep she needs during the night and as a result suffers constant nightmares, hallucinations and sleep paralysis. She said: ‘I have a very different sleep pattern to other people and can wake up to 15 times a night, so I don’t get the restorative sleep I need. ‘I get terrible nightmares and hallucinations which are triggered by things I have seen in the news or online - I slip straight back into dream sleep while drifting off which means I am unable to stop myself going back into the nightmare. 7am - Wake up, have breakfast, get the children ready for school . 9am - Walk Lucie to school . 9.30am - Go back to bed for the first nap . 11.30am - Wake up from nap, continue with day including doing housework . 1pm - Go back to bed for afternoon nap . 3pm - Wake up from nap . 3.30pm - Pick up Lucie from school . 3.30pm - 10pm - Prepare dinner for the children, enjoy the evening together . 10pm - Go to bed . ‘I also have hallucinations where I hear intruders coming into my home. ‘It’s exhausting and incredibly emotionally draining.’ She added: ‘I want to be the best parent I can be for my children so I have found that taking strategic naps during the day is the only way I can keep my sleeping under control.’ Ms Metters first started to notice her symptoms of hallucinations, nightmares and extreme tiredness when she was 13 years old, but her symptoms were mild and didn’t become a serious problem until she was 26. She found herself falling asleep in public and in places which could have been dangerous - like on the back a moped while on a summer holiday in Greece. She said: ‘I was that tired on the holiday that I closed my eyes sitting on the back of the bike and actually nodded off straight to sleep.’ Ms Metters got to the stage where she was unable to control her sleeping during the day had to take naps in laybys while driving to work. She said: ‘In the past I found that despite loud music, bumpy roads and being in public my tiredness could not be stopped and before I managed my condition I could sleep anywhere.’ Before she learned to control her condition, Ms Metters fell asleep on a moped and also on the bus while holding Aimee as a new-born baby . Ms Metters suffers nightmares and hallucinations at night meaning she does not sleep well. This causes her to be exhausted during the day and leaves her at risk of falling asleep in inappropriate places . The breaking point came for Ms Metters when she became a mother. She . said: ‘A few weeks after I had given birth to my eldest daughter I was . sat on the bus and I found myself repeatedly nodding off, while trying . to hold my new-born baby. ‘This was when I realised I could no longer hide from my tiredness and my doctors needed to take my complaints seriously.’ Narcolepsy, which occurs in one in every 2,000 people, is a sleep disorder that causes a person to suddenly fall asleep at inappropriate times. It is a long-term neurological condition that disrupts normal sleeping patterns. Symptoms include, sleep attacks, daytime sleepiness, nightmares, hallucinations and cataplexy - temporary muscle weakness in response to emotion. It is often caused by an autoimmune response - this is when antibodies are released by the body but instead of destroying disease, they attack healthy cells. In the case of narcolepsy, antibodies attack the areas of the brain that produce a sleep-regulating chemical. There is currently no cure but the condition can sometimes be managed, for example, by taking regular naps, eating healthily and exercising. In some cases, medications such as antidepressants or stimulants can also help. For 12 years she was constantly told . by doctors that it was just stress was making her tired but when she was . finally diagnosed she was relieved. She . also suffers from cataplexy which means she loses control of her neck . and leg muscles at moments of extreme emotion, such as if she is in pain . or laughing hard. She manages to control this with medication, but unfortunately hasn’t managed to find an effective medication for her narcolepsy - which is why she must stick religiously to her napping routine. Before she was diagnosed, Ms Metters would resort to extreme measures to try and keep herself awake, including taking layers off to stay cold, sitting on the most uncomfortable seat available and even physically hurting herself. She said: ‘I would make excuses to go to the toilet and then slap my face, and splash myself with water to try and wake up. ‘I would pinch my skin really hard to try and try to use the pain to keep me awake.’ When she finally gained the courage to explain the severity of her narcolepsy to her friends, family and children’s school she was pleased with the support she received. However, she says there were a few people who assumed her condition made her a less attentive mother - something she fiercely rejects. She has now worked out a routine which works for her family. She will save what she calls ‘screen time’ for time when she needs to rest, letting her children watch television, play on the laptop, or watch a DVD while she sleeps. Ms Metters worries that some people think her condition makes her a less attentive mother but says she is still dedicated to her children and that she does not allow her illness to get her down . She said: ‘I do have guilt about finding . time to rest when my children are in my care. I never wanted my . children to have to occupy themselves. ‘But I also have to look after me- I have to rest and not step outside my limitations so I can be a good mother.’ She joked: ‘The children have become wise to it now. They tell me I look tired and ask if I want a nap just so they can have a go on the computer!’ She added: ‘Although I am more tired than other people, I haven’t let it get me down and I am still dedicated to my children and determined to enjoy life.’","Claire Metters has narcolepsy, a condition that effects sleep-wake cycles .

ffa1546fb67d401b451deaf2435e2804773425b2,"(CNN) -- It's happened. The build-up and anxiety over whether folks like Chris Christie and Sarah Palin are going to throw their hats in the ring for the GOP presidential primary has reached critical mass. And now, the will-they-or-won't-they game has flipped from fun and energizing to damaging to the party. Christie and Palin now do conservatives more harm than good. With the question marks still lingering in the ether, and pundits on both sides of the aisle still performing their daily trapeze act -- swinging back and forth between ""yes, he's running"" and ""no, she isn't"" -- the focus on Christie and Palin has taken valuable resources and attention away from the rest of the field. Because of those question marks, conservatives haven't been able to invest fully in the candidates who are running. They haven't been able to imagine one of them as president. They've held back support, money and endorsements, because they still don't know that the field is settled. And Christie and Palin are not entirely without fault. Though the bombastic New Jersey governor had been emphatic in his promise not to run for months, despite our continued speculation that he was fibbing, now his friends are saying otherwise. And he's certainly been acting like a candidate, traveling the country for big-ticket fundraisers, speaking at the exalted Reagan Library, and telling his supporters that he's ""hearing"" and ""feeling"" their pleas. If he really wanted to convince us he wasn't considering it, all he has to do is endorse someone else. It's really very simple. As for Palin, she's been forthright about her contemplation, admitting that she's thinking about it but hasn't yet decided. As formidable and admirable as both Christie and Palin are, it's reached the point where they've both become more than just a distraction. They're now a detriment. How sincere will it look, after all, in two months when the field is set and both are absent from it, and conservatives suddenly try to pretend that they are satisfied and enthusiastic about Rick Perry, Mitt Romney or Michele Bachmann? Sure, we begged Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Paul Ryan, Chris Christie, Sarah Palin and everyone else to run before, but now we're totally behind one of these guys. If there were ever a gift to present to President Obama, it's the gift of obvious apathy. Time's up, governors. If Chris Christie and Sarah Palin want to run, get in there. If not, definitively and convincingly take your names out of the running. Conservatives need to begin the arduous job of whittling down the field and picking their frontrunner. The fact that there have been five GOP straw polls in as many weeks with as many different winners is proof that these unanswered questions are creating a dangerous ambivalence among conservative voters. The breathless speculation has been fun, but now it's time to get to work. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of S.E. Cupp.","Are Chris Christie and Sarah Palin running for president, or aren't they?
Their refusal to answer definitively is damaging to the GOP, said S.E. Cupp .

Douglas True, 21, reportedly dialed 911 for Fort Smith Police at around 11:52 a.m. on Sunday, asking that they come to a home on the 2900 block of South 66th Street. He waved them into the driveway, and upon entering the house police discovered the body of Briana Butler stabbed to death and lying on the bathroom floor. She was 22 years old and seven months pregnant. Scroll down for video . Police say Briana Butler was found stabbed to death seven months into a pregnancy this Sunday after a fight with her boyfriend . Douglas True, 21, told police that he had fought with Butler but had no memory of stabbing her to death . Butler's daughter Bonnie, 2, was discovered sleeping in a nearby room with minor facial injuries, KFSM reports. The toddler was immediately transported to a local hospital and should make a full recovery. Upon searching the home police recovered a knife they believe was used in the homicide, and it was later confirmed that lacerations on her throat and torso were consistent with knife wounds. True was arrested on suspicion of two charges of capital murder for her and her unborn child. He has been transferred to Sebastian County Detention Center to be held without bond. Police say True called his mother to say he'd done a terrible thing and would spend his life in prison . 'True was advised of his rights and gave a statement admitting that he and Butler got into an argument that escalated to a physical altercation,' according to an affidavit. 'True stated that he was intoxicated and did not remember what happened after that. True said that he got up in the middle of the night and found Butler's body in the bathroom and went back to the couch and passed out.' The next morning he woke up, cut a cast off his arm, then called his mother to tell her he'd done something bad and would spend the rest of his life in prison. Chief deputy prosecutor Linda Ward told the Times Record the investigation will continue before charges are filed. Butler's ex-husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler, told WHBS that Bonnie had been an attentive and conscientious mother. Because Butler was pregnant, as this sonogram shows, True is being charged with two murders . 'No human being deserves to be done like that,' said Butler's ex-husband and father of Bonnie, Joshua Butler. 'To take your anger and rage out on another person and just totally take . them out, I mean that's just, cowardly right there' Eyewitness Barry Wayne, who saw True's arrest, said that a niece living in the complex where the crime took palce told him she was scared something had happened. 'She had never been in nothing like this before,' he said, 'I seen . three or four police cars and then I was sitting on the porch, and I . seen a gentlemen in the back and they said he had murdered her.' He said the girl would move out soon.

ffa1facb1ea645320525705e8bc723bd6b0809c6,"(CNN) -- London experienced protests in the both the east and center of the capital just hours before the Olympic opening ceremony. Taxi drivers gathered at Hyde Park corner as part of a demonstration against Olympic traffic lanes, while protestors held a ""die-in"" against major sponsor Dow Chemicals outside the Olympic Park in Stratford. Despite the protest, thousands turned out to see the torch make it's final journey through London. Preparations were also in place for a special opening night concert in Hyde Park featuring bands Snow Patrol and Duran Duran. The first world records of the London 2012 Olympics were set by blind South Korean archer Im Dong Hyun-- hours before Friday's much-anticipated opening ceremony was due to begin. The traffic protest started at 2pm, with taxi driver Mick Bailey telling CNN: ""We're all sitting in our cabs and traffic is at a standstill. It's a sea of black cabs as far as the eye can see. Cab drivers argue the traffic lanes -- which are restricted to Olympic officials and athletes -- should also be available to taxis. Mick, who has been a Black Cab driver for more than 30 years, said businesses had dropped off since the implementation of the lanes. He added: ""The Olympic lanes are going to mean a great deal of hardship for drivers and passengers. We won't be able to pick up people on the left hand side of the road, there will be diversions and higher meter readings."" By 3pm the serious congestion had eased, the Automobile Association (AA) said. The protest followed another demonstration against major sponsor Dow Chemicals Friday morning. Members of the Bhopal Medical Appeal held a 'die-in' in protest against the company it claims has responsibility for the fatal 1984 gas leak in India. Dow Chemicals is a major sponsor of the Olympics, with the multimillion-pound deal including a fabric wrap around the stadium in east London. However, the deal has caused controversy with campaigners arguing Dow holds responsibility for the disaster in Bhopal, which killed an estimated 15,000 --- a claim which it denies. Dow bought Union Carbide -- the company which ran the plant -- 16 years after the disaster and argues it has no responsibility. Protesters gathered at 10.30am outside the gates of the Olympic park. Dressed in shrouds, they pretended to be ""dead"" -- a reference to victims of the fatal leak at the pesticide plant. London Assembly member Navin Shah told gathered protesters: ""I am proud that the Games are taking place in London but the protesters like me are simply against the sponsorship of Dow Chemical who have betrayed the victims of the Bhopal Disaster. These protests symbolize peoples' concerns about large scale environmental and human rights abuses."" Dow Chemicals told CNN it remained ""fully committed to our partnership with the IOC and to contributing to a successful, positive London 2012 Games"" and questioned whether the protest should go ahead. ""The use of the Olympic Games to protest has become an unfortunate part of what should be a global celebration. We believe in freedom of speech and encourage debate on this important issue,"" said a Dow spokesman in a statement. ""However, we regret the misinformed and misdirected allegations and actions of some, which are not constructive to the resolution of the issue or consistent with the spirit of the Olympic Games.""","London cab drivers cause gridlock in Olympic lanes protest .

ffa3038472c656cb0b655693d3de3a253da94cfb,"The last few days have been something of a whirlwind for Joey Prusak whose story has been all over the internet. The Hopskins, Minnesota Dairy Queen employee saw 'an older lady' steal a $20 bill from a blind customer after unknowingly dropping it on the floor. Joey ended up confronting the thief and asked her to return the money to its original owner. Scroll down for video... Serving up kindness: Joey Prusak, 19, an employee at the Hopkins, Minnesota Dairy Queen (pictured) gave a blind customer $20 out of his own pocket after he saw another customer steal the man's money he dropped on the ground . Honorable: Joey Prusak, 19, said that returning the money to the blind man 'felt like it was the right thing to do' When she refused, he ended up giving $20 back to her on behalf of Dairy Queen. It was, however, his own money. A fellow customer witnessed the interaction and wrote an email to the store which was then printed, posted on the store noticeboard and then photographed and posted online. Joey has simply said that he was just doing his job. Mr Prusak started working at the Dairy Queen in Hopkins five years ago when he was just 14. Sweet spot: The thieving customer was asked to leave and the witness said they will forever be a Dairy Queen customer after the incident (stock photo) Nice tip: A witness emailed the company and praised the employee . 'It's the only job I've had, the only . job I've needed,' he smiled. He is now the manager of the store and . essentially runs the branch. The . letter to the store explained how the customer saw a blind man had . taken his food and sat down inside the store to eat. Joey went . over to him and opened his wallet, giving him $20 of his own cash saying that . he wanted to give him the money 'on behalf of Dairy Queen' before . promising that it had the same face value as the bill he dropped. 'I . was in shock by the generosity that your employee had, taking his own . money out of his own wallet to give to the customer because some other . lady decided to steal something that wasn't hers,' the customer wrote. He talks about the incident, which happened on September the 10th, in the most modest of manners. '[After . the visually imparied man gave his order] right then and there I knew . when he dropped that $20 bill, game's over, he's not going to know,' explained Mr Prusak to KARE11. 'He . just kept walking and that's when the lady picked it up and I thought, . she's going to give it back 'cause she picked it up so quickly.' Mr Prusak said he then saw the woman her put the money in her purse. He didn't know what to say, at least not at first. When the customer reached the counter for her order, Joey confronted her. She claimed the money was hers and he said it wasn't. 'I . said, ma'am I'm not going to serve someone as disrespectful as you, so . you can either return the $20 bill and I'll serve you, or you can . leave,' explained Prusak.  'And she goes well it's my $20 dollar bill, . and I go, we'll then you can leave.' Accolades: Joey received a call from Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world (and a major shareholder in Dairy Queen) and he has had offers to appear on Queen Latifah's TV show . It was one of the other customers in the store who saw what happened and wrote an email to Dairy Queen. An impressed co-worker decided to post the message on Facebook and it ended up going viral.

ffa36c405c3007bb5bd7d15fbd8a1d6df2ef314d,"(CNN) -- They were standing near the finish line, cheering the runners in the Boston Marathon. It was a beautiful, cool day when two bombs unleashed chaos and killed three people. Friends of those killed say they are devastated by the senseless deaths. Here is some of what we know about each of the victims: . Krystle Campbell, 29, Arlington, Massachusetts . ""She was the best,"" Campbell's distraught mother, Patty, told reporters on Tuesday. ""You couldn't ask for a better daughter."" The family is heartbroken and still in shock, Patty Campbell said as she tried to read a statement on the family's porch. Everyone loved Krystle, she said. ""She had a heart of gold. She was always smiling,"" Patty Campbell said as her son, Billy, clutched her with his right arm. Krystle's grandmother said the 29-year-old was a special kind of person who nurtured deep friendships. ""Oh, she was a beautiful girl,"" Lillian Campbell told CNN's Jake Tapper. ""She was very happy, outgoing, a hard worker."" Lillian Campbell said her granddaughter even lived with her for a year and a half and was ""great with me."" Her granddaughter was always willing to help someone in need, she said. ""And she was, she was just beautiful. She was a fun-loving girl,"" Campbell said. Krystle Campbell once worked at Summer Shack, a seafood restaurant in the Boston area that posted a statement on its Facebook page saying she was beloved. ""She was an incredible woman, always full of energy and hard at work, but never too tired to share her love and a smile with everyone,"" the post said. ""She was an inspiration to all of us. Please keep her and her family in your thoughts and prayers."" According to the Boston Globe, Campbell had taken a job with Jimmy's Steer House in Arlington. The Globe reported that Campbell often went to the see the marathon runners. ""She's been doing it since she was a little girl,"" Lillian Campbell told the newspaper. ""She didn't miss a marathon, watching it at the finish line."" Campbell was a 2001 graduate of Medford High School, the town's mayor, Michael McGlynn, said. CNN affiliate WHDH reported that the Campbells are longtime residents of Medford. Martin Richard, 8, Dorchester, Massachusetts . Like many young boys in New England, Martin Richard loved his Boston Red Sox and the Bruins. ""He wore his (Red Sox second baseman) Dustin Pedroia shirt to school last week,"" neighbor Bill Forry told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Martin was a terrific athlete, too, Forry said, but he was also a very good student who would help others who were having trouble with homework. ""A quiet kid, but a compassionate kid -- and somebody who was a leader,"" Forry said. Martin attended the Neighborhood House Charter School. He ""was a bright, energetic young boy who had big dreams and high hopes for his future,"" the school said in a statement. ""We are heartbroken by this loss."" His father, William Richard, released a statement asking people to ""continue to pray for my family as we remember Martin."" A neighbor, Jane Sherman, said that the Richard family is a ""typical all-American family"" and that Martin and his little brother always loved to play in their yard, no matter the weather. Richard's mother and sister are recovering from serious injuries sustained in the bombing, the father said. Another life ended: A Boston University grad student . While the name of the third victim killed by the blasts was not officially confirmed on Tuesday, Boston University said that the person was a graduate student at the school. ""The student was one of three friends who watched the race near the finish line,"" the university said on its website. ""Another of the three students, also a BU grad student, was injured and is in stable condition at Boston Medical Center."" The third person in the group was unharmed, the statement added. A short time later, China's consulate in New York announced that the deceased victim was a Chinese national. At the family's request, the consulate did not name her. According to a profile on LinkedIn, the woman was a graduate student in mathematics and statistics at Boston University who was due to get her master's degree in 2014. She graduated from a Chinese university with a degree in international economics, the professional networking site indicated. She'd also previously studied for a semester at the University of California at Riverside. Chinese students at Boston University respected her family's request for anonymity, with many of them forming a tight-knit group. One of them, former CNN intern Alex Shi, said that the students are deeply saddened. Many of the students feel affected because people were trying hard to locate those reported missing -- including the victim -- by calling hospitals and posting on social media.","Three people were killed when two homemade explosives went off at the Boston Marathon .

No historical records of the 12th century monarch have survived and the only clues to his existence are his skull, bones and burial crown kept in a small gilded box in his home country. Now, researchers from Uppsala University have opened this box to display the relics to the public, and plan to use DNA and X-ray scans to reveal more about his origins and life.

They hope DNA tests will reveal more about how the king died . King Erik IX reigned from 1155 until his death on 18 May 1160. He was later named the patron saint of Sweden and his burial crown is said to be the oldest . known royal crown in the country. Many reports claim the king, also known as Erik Jedvardsson, was murdered by Emund Ulvbane - an assassin hired . by people working for the Sverker dynasty, in order for them to regain . the control of the kingdom.

King Erik IX reigned from 1155 until his death on 18 May 1160. He was later named the patron saint of Sweden. Erik's feast . day in the Roman Catholic Church and Evangelical Lutheran Church in .

However, the current Trinity church in Uppsala was founded in the late . 13th century so could not be the church where Erik was slain. Scholars have discussed different . locations of the older Trinity church, but the presence of pre-cathedral . graves in the vicinity of the cathedral might suggest that the original . Trinity church was located at the same spot as the cathedral. It is thought Uppsala Cathedral was built on the murder site deliberately to house Erik's remains. Legend states Erik was accosted by the rebel nobles near Uppsala at Östra Aros . as he was leaving Mass on Ascension Day. He was . thrown to the ground from his horse, tortured and then beheaded. But none of these claims have ever been confirmed and all information about the royal is based on later legend aimed at having him established as a saint. Uppsala University said it hopes the tests will reveal more about how he died, his injuries and his family history.

In an effort to conquer and convert the Finns, he allegedly led the First Swedish Crusade against the native Finns and persuaded an English Bishop Henry of Uppsala to remain in Finland to evangelize the natives, later becoming a martyr there. He was also responsible for codifying the laws of his kingdom, after which he was given the nickname Erik the Lawgiver. The box has been opened several times before, but this is the first time DNA tests will be carried out and the crown put on public display. During the 14th century, some of Erik's relics were removed from the box and handed out to individuals and other churches.","The remains of King Erik IX of Sweden have been kept in a box since 1160 .

Ava Maye Riley-Maher, now 14 months, was diagnosed with a rare cancer-like disease – called Langerhan's Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) - aged just five months. Ava had to undergo 15 weeks of aggressive chemotherapy and receive more than 100 blood transfusions in order to keep her body functioning. Ava Maye Riley-Maher, now 14 months, was diagnosed with a rare cancer-like disease - called Langerhan's Cell Histiocytosis - aged just five months . But she failed to respond to the treatment and doctors said a bone marrow transplant would be her best hope of beating the disease. Fortunately, a match was found - and her parents say they now wake up every day thankful that she is still alive. Ava was released from the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital in June, two days before her first birthday, and is recovering at home in Manchester with mother Kirsty Riley, 24. Her father, Jamie Maher, 28, has also been at her side throughout the ordeal. Ava still has to be kept in semi-isolation and has to take more than 20 medicines a day - but her last transfusion was five weeks ago and her mother says she is hopeful her daughter will make a full recovery. LCH affects just one in 250,000 children a year in the UK. Ava had to undergo 15 weeks of aggressive chemotherapy and receive more than 100 blood transfusions in order to keep her body functioning . It is not technically a cancer, but it is cancer-like and can be treated with chemotherapy. LCH is not technically a cancer, but it is cancer-like and can be treated with chemotherapy. LCH . occurs when the body accumulates too many Langerhan's cells - these are . a type of white blood cell that normally help fight infection. In . LCH too many of these cells are produced and they build up in certain . parts of the body where they can form tumours and damage organs. The cause of the disease is unknown. About 50 children in the UK develop LCH every year. Symptoms . include swollen lymph glands, poor appetite, bone pain, a skin rash, . discharge from the ears, breathing difficulties and jaundice. There is an 80 to 90 per cent survival rate. The condition develops from cells in the skin. These cells are normally only found in the skin and airways but in LCH abnormal cells can be found in other parts of the body, including the bone marrow, liver, spleen and pituitary gland. About 50 children in the UK develop LCH every year. Symptoms include swollen lymph glands, poor appetite, bone pain, a skin rash, discharge from the ears, breathing difficulties and jaundice. There is an 80 to 90 per cent survival rate. Ms Riley said: ‘As soon as you hear the word cancer you think “that’s it” and we couldn’t see any light at the end of the tunnel. ‘To see her undergoing all these treatments when she was so small was just heartbreaking, but we had to hope that she would get a donor.’ Ava spent eight weeks on the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow donor register until a match was found. Her parents do not know the donor’s identity other than that she is a 21-year-old woman from the UK, but they can contact her six months after the operation. Ms Riley said: ‘The weeks leading up to the operation were probably the scariest part as we didn’t know whether it would come off or whether anything would go wrong. ‘It was only when I saw the bone marrow delivered to the theatre in a bag that I knew that it was her lifeline. But even then she could have gone either way after the transplant. ‘Looking at her now it’s hard to think about what might have happened. The doctors are amazed at how she’s recovered. ‘We wake up every day and are just thankful she’s here. When she walks out of the school gates with her friends I will remember how lucky we are.’ Ava (pictured with her parents, Kirsty Riley and Jamie Maher) failed to respond to the treatment so had to have a bone marrow transplant.

ffa4a9c03e0e1e3b7edc42eadf89f6e7c1069d01,"Universities have been accused of social engineering after drawing up admissions schemes that favour applicants from poorer backgrounds. Instead of selecting students solely on merit, four institutions – Edinburgh, Leeds, Bristol and Birmingham – have devised systems which boost the grades of children from low-income homes. In some cases, this can see a disadvantaged child with three Bs at A-level winning a place over a privately-educated child with three A*s. Controversial: Universities have been accused of social engineering after drawing up plans to actively favour pupils from poorer backgrounds. Leeds university is one of those which has drawn up points systems which boost the exam grades of children from low-income homes. Critics said the system could discriminate against middle class children whose parents have sacrificed a lot to give them a good education. Ministers have previously urged universities to consider backgrounds – or ‘the contextual data’ – when deciding whether to offer a place, and most do this on a case-by-case basis. Speaking out: In May, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said universities should take 'into account the impact of background in assessing university applications; to create a 'fair race' for degree places . But the latest plans are different – and more controversial – because they give each applicant a numerical score based partly on social background. Freedom of Information requests reveal the points awarded by Edinburgh for going to a very low-performing school boost the score of a child with three Bs beyond that of one with three A*s from a better school. At Leeds, the system allowed medicine applicants to be given so many points for coming from a poor area that three B grades effectively became three A*s. It was suspended earlier this year. Bristol is implementing a points system where pupils from poor schools ‘will be given an automatic weighting to their total academic score’, while Birmingham has drawn up a similar policy but is not yet using it. Tim Hands, headmaster of the independent Magdalen College School in Oxford, said admissions which scored contextual data could be ‘bordering on generic discrimination’. ‘Students deserve transparency and accuracy, not hasty measures which risk appearing subservient demonstrations of political correctness.’ But Rebecca Gaukroger, head of admissions at Edinburgh, said: ‘We don’t accept that the scoring of academic grades or contextual data undermines the holistic assessment of applications.’","Edinburgh, Leeds, Bristol and Birmingham have drawn up the plans .

ffa5081b0356ed6a0dc15de3178258f6740785e6,"(CNN) -- Madonna will hear Friday whether she will be allowed to adopt a child from Malawi, a spokeswoman for the African nation's attorney general told CNN Monday. Madonna holds her adopted Malawian son, David Banda, in 2007. The singer was in court in Malawi, one of the poorest nations in the world, on Monday for a hearing in the case, said Zione Ntaba, press officer for the country's Attorney General's Office. The judge read documents and questioned the parties, the spokeswoman said. Madonna should appear in person Friday to hear the judge's decision, Ntaba said. The child Madonna is seeking to adopt is named Chifundo James, she confirmed. ""Chifundo"" means ""Mercy,"" the name earlier reports have cited for the girl, Ntaba added. An uncle of the girl was scheduled to sign adoption papers Monday, according to Martin Geissler, a reporter for the ITN television network who is in Malawi, but he does not appear to have been in the court. The child's family will have to give their permission for the adoption to proceed, Geissler said, but need not be physically present in the court to do so. Madonna arrived at the court Monday morning in a convoy of four SUVs with black-out windows, Geissler said from the capital Lilongwe. Eight security guards prevented journalists and the press from getting too close to the 50-year-old singer. ""She's keeping very tight-lipped,"" Geissler said. Chifundo James is reported to be 4-years-old. She has two uncles and a grandfather, who were not in court Monday, Geissler said. An international charity has criticized Madonna's plan to adopt the child. ""The best place for a child is in his or her family in their home community,"" spokesman Dominic Nutt of Save the Children said in a statement. ""Most children in orphanages have one parent still living, or have an extended family that can care for them in the absence of their parents."" The charity argued that foreign adoptions should happen only if a child does not have any relatives, and all other options have been considered. Under Malawian law, foreign adopters would have to spend a year or more living in the African country with the children they want to adopt, Geissler said. The rules were put in place to prevent child trafficking. The purpose of the law, Ntaba explained, is for the authorities to observe the prospective parent to make sure the relationship is not abusive -- ""that the parent will behave well around the child,"" she said. She said that American or British social services may also provide the monitoring and in the case of David Banda, the first Malawian child Madonna adopted, Malawi social services officers traveled to the United Kingdom to visit the child in Madonna's home. The judge has the discretion to allow Madonna to take the child home with her immediately, Geissler said. She is scheduled to leave Saturday, he said. Madonna adopted David Banda from Malawi in 2006. She has two other children. Press reports say Chifundo James's teenaged mother died days after giving birth to her, Geissler said. She lives in an orphanage. ""Madonna first came into contact with her a few years ago and fell in love with her,"" he added. ""She has always had in mind that this is the girl she was going to come back and adopt."" Madonna has been involved with Malawi for several years. She made a documentary, ""I Am Because We Are,"" which highlighted poverty, AIDS and other diseases devastating Malawi's children. She also helps run a nonprofit, Raising Malawi, which implements initiatives to help the needy in the southeastern Africa nation. On Sunday, Madonna arrived in Malawi and toured the village of Chinkhota, assessing plans to build a school there and other possible Raising Malawi investments.

Switzerland will have a national referendum on immigration after an environmental group collected enough support to force it through. The Ecopop group gathered 120,700 certified signatures which is well over the 100,000 required to bring about the nationwide poll. They are concerned that natural resources are under pressure from overpopulation, in a country of eight million people of whom over a quarter are foreign. Overpopulated: The environmental group want to limit immigration . Ecopop claim they are opposed to xenophobia and racism but say they need to limit the intake of new people to avoid urbanisation and help preserve agricultural land. The Swiss People's Party, a right-wing group, have also collected enough signatures to force a refendum on toughening immigration quotas. They believe immigration is to blame for rising rent costs and busie prublic transport systems. The environmental group demand that annual population growth through immigration to be capped at 0.2% and a tenth of foreign aid money to be spent on birth control measures abroad. Switzerland's population has risen over 15 per cent since 1990. It was shown to be an attractive place to work in March with a low unemployment rate and comparatively high salaries. Overcrowded: Immigration is to blame for public transport being busy, claim the Swiss People's Party . Former director of the Swiss environment department and current Ecopop member Philippe Roch told the BBC: 'The pressure on land, nature and the countryside is considerable, and quality of life is continuously deteriorating due to a lack of living space.' Referenda can take place up to four times a year in Switzerland's system of direct democracy. Switzerland's government has urged voters not to back the initiative because it would bring the country into conflict with its treaty obligations with the European Union. Until last year Switzerland had a quota of 2,000 residency permits a year for citizens of the 'A8' nations, who joined the EU in 2004 - Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Despite criticism from European Union officals the Swiss reinstated the immigration quota in April.","Group say they are not racist but need a limit to curb urbanisation and preserve agricultural land .

ffa5b94b88011503aea40a939795963b64d95c6d,"(CNN)The death of a 14-year-old shot by police just blocks from his school is the latest flashpoint as political tensions mount in Venezuela and pockets of anti-government protests erupt throughout the country. Kluibert Roa Nuñez, a high school student, was killed Tuesday when he got caught between protesters and national police in the western city of San Cristobal. A police officer fatally shot Kluibert, officials say. The government and the opposition alike have condemned the teen's killing, but Venezuela's recent history of violence and sharp political polarization hang over this shooting. Already protesters opposed to President Nicolas Maduro's government are pointing to the teen's death as a fresh rallying cry. And Maduro has blamed protesters for the violence that led to the shooting. A year ago, San Cristobal was the birthplace of anti-government protests that spread nationwide. The standoffs between security forces and protesters lingered for weeks and became violent, with more than 40 deaths, according to the government. Three witnesses at Tuesday's protest said that Kluibert was not a protester and had inadvertently come across the confrontation after leaving school. Vivian Nuñez, the slain teen's mother, told CNN en Español her son was walking four blocks from his school when a riot broke out around him. The protesters -- mostly students from a nearby university -- were running from police at the moment that Kluibert walked into the area, according to the witnesses, who spoke with CNN en Español. The teen tried to protect himself by ducking under a car but suffered a direct shot from an officer's firearm, the witnesses said. CNN has not independently confirmed how the shooting unfolded. The governor of the state of Tachira, where San Cristobal is located, declined to comment on his government's version of events. The teen's death sparked several protests around the country Wednesday. In Caracas, demonstrators outside the justice ministry held up notebooks smeared with red paint to symbolize the blood of the country's youth they say has been spilled. ""A bloody notebook. This is what we, the students, have -- ideas,"" protester Hilda Rubi said. ""We say to Mr. Nicolas Maduro, 'Are you afraid of the students? These are our weapons: a notebook, pens, thoughts and ideology.' "" The Venezuelan government responded quickly to the killing, detaining and identifying the national police officer who shot the teen. The interior ministry named Javier Mora Ortiz, 23, as the shooter. Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz announced Wednesday that Mora is formally charged with intentional homicide, and that nine protesters were also arrested in San Cristobal. Interior Minister Carmen Melendez, speaking on state television, vowed that the officer would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. She appealed for calm, asking students to remember the 43 deaths recorded in clashes last year. The police has been reformed since then, she said, calling the national police force a ""protector of human rights."" ""This is an isolated incident that does not represent the behavior of the new, humanist police,"" Melendez said. To protesters, and to the family of the slain teen, these comments seem to be insincere, or outright lies. Erick Roa, the father of the slain teen, told CNN en Español's Fernando del Rincon that he wants the full weight of the law to be applied to the officer but is not comforted by the government's actions. The officer's quick confession might be part of a strategy to get a lenient sentence, Roa said. He is afraid the justice system will go easy on Mora because he is a police officer. ""This was a murder; this was a homicide committed by this man, and he should pay with the full weight of the law,"" he said. The father also questioned the government's claims of what kind of projectile killed his son. The interior minister said Mora shot Kluibert with a shotgun loaded with rubber pellets. Roa said that if the weapon was indeed a shotgun, it was loaded with lead pellets, not rubber. The coroner's report said that a firearm caused the fatal wound, without detailing whether it was rubber or lead pellets, the father said. The government also said that police provided first aid to the injured teen, something that witnesses deny. Roa pleaded for police to ""be guardians"" while on duty, saying he hopes another child won't become a victim. The fury over Tuesday's shooting echoes the arguments made by pro- and anti-government groups in the past. Maduro framed the boy's death around the actions of the protesters in San Cristobal. He described a group of ""hooded youths"" who were ""being violent,"" beating police and pelting officers with rocks before police responded with force. Critics of the government turned to one of their most powerful tools -- social media -- to accuse the security forces of abuses and to share photos they say back their allegations. Tweets were tagged with #SOSVenezuela, #PrayForVenezuela and #MaduroAsesinoDeEstudiantes, literally accusing the President of killing students. Government supporters tweeted under the banner #ApoyoRotundoAMaduro, or ""complete support for Maduro."" All this turmoil comes during an economic crisis in oil-rich Venezuela. Venezuelans have endured years of shortages of basic goods, products and services. Consumers have to stand in line for hours for staples such as milk, chicken and cornmeal. Even toilet paper and condoms are scarce. Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, is overvalued. The official exchange rate is 6.3 per dollar, but dollars are being exchanged in the black market at 190-to-1 creating all kinds of problems for foreign companies, including American ones. Last week, the mayor of Caracas, Venezuela's capital and largest city, was arrested and accused of plotting to overthrow Maduro's government. In fragile economy, Venezuela arrests opposition figures: Why you should care . Mayor Antonio Ledezma, one of the opposition's most visible leaders, was arrested in a raid by federal agents. The opposition says the mayor's arrest is an attempt to divert attention from the country's economic woes. CNN's Kay Guerrero, Miguel Escalona and Catherine E.

ffa67df0ff944a9b63fcc1d52f8756757af80b60,"CCTV footage at the Costcutter store in Essex captured the would-be thief who was wearing the Rod Stewart style mask . A shop worker was left terrified after a man wearing a Rod Stewart mask pulled a gun out on her during a daylight robbery – but ended up leaving empty handed after botching the raid. Trina Arthur, 31, was working alone in the Costcutter store when the man walked in wearing a mask in likeness to the famous blonde rocker. The mother-of-two, who was cashing up behind the counter when she felt someone lean over and ruffle her hair, looked up to find the man pointing a handgun at her. He then attempted to lean over the counter and grab cash from the till but was spooked when Miss Arthur screamed and hit the panic button. The would-be thief ended up fleeing empty handed and police believe he may have run off towards a nearby alleyway in Maldon, Essex. A police helicopter, armed officers and dog units were scrambled to the scene in a bid to find the masked man following the incident on March 27. Miss Arthur, who has worked at the Costcutter store for three years, said: ‘I initially thought it was one of the regular customers having a joke when I looked up and saw the Rod Stewart mask. ‘Then I saw he had a gun and I just started screaming. ‘As soon as he saw me hit the panic button, he ran out of the shop.’ The terrifying incident has left the shop worker on edge. She said: ‘I am petrified now. I have not been able to sleep. I keep seeing him with the gun. It felt like forever until the police arrived - I have never been so scared. ‘It’s not something that you think will ever happen to you.’ Trina Arthur, 31, was working alone in the Costcutter store when the man walked in wearing a mask in the likeness of rocker Rod Stewart, pictured . The would-be thief, pictured, pointed a handgun at shop worker Miss Arthur but ended up fleeing empty handed after she pressed the panic alarm . The shop’s owner Mustafa Demirci, 34, said: ‘Luckily no-one was hurt and he did not get any money. ‘As soon as Trina called me, I knew it was serious from the tone of her voice but I never expected it to be an armed robbery.’ The store was able to provide police with CCTV of the incident which shows the man in his bizarre mask. Essex Police said the suspect was around 5ft 8ins tall, of medium build and was wearing a grey and white top and black coat. A police helicopter, armed officers and dog units were scrambled to the scene in a bid to find the masked man following the incident on March 27 . He was also wearing work-style trousers with reflective stripes on them during the raid which occurred at around 9.45am. Officers today arrested a 51 year-old man from Maldon, Essex, in connection with the attempted armed robbery. He was questioned by police before being released on bail until May 19 pending further enquiries.

ffa7fee49d822a04622bfdcf66d4bb736b88b727,"Homeland Security . Secretary Jeh Johnson on Tuesday defended to Congress the Obama . administration's decision to allow millions of illegal immigrants relief from deportation even as conservatives on Capitol Hill aggressively pushed to defund parts of his department. Johnson spoke at a hearing before the House Committee on . Homeland Security that marked the first public hearing on President Barack Obama's . executive actions, which are expected to allow as many as five million immigrants to remain in the United States indefinitely, since he announced them late last month. The DHS head begged lawmakers today not to express their anger at the president and the administration over immigration through the appropriations process. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson testifies on Capitol Hill on Tuesday before the House Homeland Security Committee on the impact of President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration . Johnson told them he could not run his department with the type of short-term spending bill that conservatives on Capitol Hill are considering. 'That is in my judgement a very bad idea for Homeland Security because during that period of a continuing resolution we cannot engage in new starts,' he told them. 'We've got some Homeland Security priorities that need to be funded now. The department head pointed out that a new presidential election cycle is about to being and he wouldn't be able to hire new Secret Service agents to protect candidates until DHS is fully funded for the entire fiscal year. Furthermore, he said he wouldn't be able to fund 'our enhanced detention capability in Texas with another continuing resolution that gets me to March.' 'I need the help of Congress to support and build upon border security, which I believe all of you support,' he said. 'So, I'm urging that we act on our current appropriations request now for the purpose and for the sake of border security and homeland security,' Johnson concluded. Republicans in the House and Senate who are deeply opposed to providing amnesty to illegal immigrants have been lobbying their colleagues to pass appropriations legislation that would only fund the Department of Homeland Security through early 2015, when they take control of both chambers of Congress. At that time they would be able to insert language into a long-term spending bill that would hinge funding for certain immigration agencies and operations on ceasing implementation of Obama's immigration actions. House Speaker John Boehner reportedly endorsed the plan in a closed-door meeting today, setting up his party's attempt to block the president's immigration policy in January and a head-to-head fight with the White House. At a press briefing afterward he said his conference had not coalesced around a specific plan yet, however. 'I said before Thanksgiving that Republicans would fight his unilateral actions,' the GOP leader said. 'We’re looking at a variety of options, both for right now and when Republicans control both Houses of the Congress next year. And we’ll continue to discuss with our members a number of options, in terms of how we will deal with this, in consultation, again, with the members. 'But no decisions have been made at this point,' he added. If Congress doesn't pass new spending legislation by Dec. 11 the federal government will shut down until it does. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has been adamant that won't happen, saying again today a shut down is not in the cards. However, he confirmed that Republicans, who are currently the minority in the Senate, would support whatever bill their colleagues in the House sent over. 'In the short-term, the Senate will be in a reactive role, he said. 'Next year, we'll be sort-of more co-equal partners on that issue. 'But right now, our view is once it's sorted out in the House, once it gets passed, I'll be supportive of that.' The White House has made its preference that legislators pass a yearlong spending bill for all government agencies known several times over. Certainty is good for the economy, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said today. 'Were hopeful that Republicans will follow their own advice in that regard and pass a full-year fed budget,' he added. Earnest said White House officials 'certainly take some heart' in McConnell's promises that there will not be a government shutdown next week. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio said after a  House Republican caucus meeting at the Capitol today that his members had not yet determined how it planned to avoid another politically damaging shutdown while holding the president accountable for his immigration actions . Republicans on Capitol Hill unleashed their fury over the immigration actions today at Johnson. Regardless of where you stand on the issue, there’s a right way to do this and a wrong way,' the committee's chairman, Rep. Michael McCaul said. 'This is not how democracy works.' Johnson told the committee he recommended each . action Obama took and continues to stand behind them. 'The reality is that, given our limited resources, these . people are not priorities for removal,' he said. McCaul, a Republican, said the president's directive would be perceived as . amnesty to those considering crossing the U.S.  border with Mexico, though. 'If we don't think that message is making its way back to . Mexico and Central America, we are simply fooling ourselves,' he said. 'We will see a wave of illegal immigration because . of the president's actions.' Johnson said the new measures are not amnesty. 'The current situation is amnesty,' he said . Furthermore, he said administration officials 'feel that we had no choice' to act given that Congress couldn't come to an agreement on comprehensive reform of its own. McCaul argued that Obama did not have the authority to authorize the order, however. In response, Johnson defended the legality of the action, saying those . who drafted the plan worked closely with the Justice . Department's Office of Legal Counsel. 'I’m satisfied as a lawyer myself — and the person who has to come here and defend these actions — that what we have done is well within our existing legal authority,' he told the committee. The White House said today it was not surprised that the GOP tore into Johnson. 'Republicans have long...adopted the view - that's contrary to the view of the vast majority of Americans - that we shouldnt reform our broken immigration system,' he said. Their views on immigration are 'stark contrasts' to those of the president, law enforcement officials, faith leaders, and even some of their fellow Republicans, he added. Later in his briefing on Tuesday Earnest told reporters, 'the fact is the closest thing we have to amnesty in this country is doing nothing.' And that's exactly what Republicans seem to be doing, he charged.","Department of Homeland Security head Jeh Johnson spoke at a hearing before the House Committee on Homeland Security .

ffa88312530a6cbbdfc38458344ac7477281413d,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- New U.S. commander Gen. David Petraeus arrived in Afghanistan Friday, a day marred by violence in a part of the troubled nation that was relatively peaceful a year ago. Petraeus arrived at NATO headquarters in Kabul in the evening, the International Security Assistance Force said. Earlier in the day, Taliban militants in the northern city of Kunduz attacked the compound of a U.S. aid agency subcontractor, killing at least five people and wounding 20 others, government officials said. On the day of Petraeus' arrival, the brazen attack served as a grim reminder for international forces that they face a difficult challenge in overcoming the Taliban insurgency, which many say has been gaining momentum. A year ago, places like Kunduz were regarded as safe -- but not anymore. The pre-dawn raid started when a suicide bomber on foot and another in a car detonated at the gate of the compound, said Mohammad Omar, the provincial governor. Following the initial assault, four gunmen stormed the facility, firing machine guns and throwing hand grenades, according to Omar. Three of the dead were foreigners -- a Filipino, a Briton and a German, Omar said. State Department spokesman Mark Toner told CNN that two American contractors were among the wounded and had been taken to the Provincial Reconstruction Team hospital in Kunduz province. The six-and-a-half-hour attack was on an office of Development Alternatives Inc., a humanitarian assistance subcontractor working with the U.S. Agency of International Development. The Taliban said the building was a base for U.S. Special Operations troops, which the U.S. military denied. DAI said four of the dead worked for its security subcontractor, Edinburgh International, and that several more EI staff were wounded as were two DAI staff members. In a conflicting report, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said six gunmen had killed nearly all of the 52 foreigners at the compound. ""The attack by insurgents in Kunduz was an attempt to intimidate Afghans and members of the international community trying to improve the lives of all Afghans,"" said NATO's International Security Assistance Force in a statement. ""This attack shows the insurgents' desire to prevent progress and draws attention to their true goal of serving themselves rather than the people of Afghanistan,"" said Navy Capt. Jane Campbell, an ISAF spokeswoman. ""We remain committed to serving alongside our Afghan partners to improve security and development for all Afghans."" CNN's Atia Abawi, Journalist Matiullah Mati and State Department Producer Charley Keyes contributed to this report.","NEW: Two of the wounded are Americans .

ffa8e2b0f630e94c5030aa3fbd999e2cbc69298b,"(CNN) -- Author John Updike, regarded as one of the greatest and most prolific writers in modern American letters, died Tuesday, his publicist said. He was 76. John Updike won many literary awards. His books, such as ""The Witches of Eastwick,"" were also best-sellers. Updike passed away Tuesday morning after battling lung cancer. He lived in Beverly Farms, Massachusetts. ""He was one of our greatest writers, and he will be sorely missed,"" said Nicholas Latimer, vice president of publicity at Updike's publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. Updike was a rarity among American writers: a much-esteemed, prize-winning author whose books -- including ""Rabbit, Run"" (1960), ""Couples"" (1968), ""The Witches of Eastwick"" (1984) and ""Terrorist"" (2006) -- were also best-sellers. Updike won the Pulitzer Prize twice: for ""Rabbit Is Rich"" (1981) and its successor, ""Rabbit at Rest"" (1991). iReport: Share your tributes to John Updike . The ""Rabbit"" series, about an angst-ridden car dealer in a town much like Updike's hometown of Shillington, Pennsylvania, spanned four novels, a novella and four decades. In the books -- which also included 1971's ""Rabbit Redux"" and a 2001 novella, ""Rabbit Remembered"" -- onetime basketball star Harry ""Rabbit"" Angstrom negotiates marriage, divorce, wealth and health problems, never quite understanding the larger forces shaping his life. ""Rabbit is not a character calculated to inspire affection, but he is an unflinchingly authentic specimen of American manhood, and his boorishness makes his rare moments of vulnerability and empathy that much more heartbreaking,"" wrote Time's Lev Grossman in naming ""Rabbit, Run"" to Time's ""All-Time 100 Novels"" list. Updike was incredibly prolific, penning essays, reviews, short stories, poetry and memoirs. His works frequently appeared in The New Yorker, including a famed 1960 essay about Ted Williams' final game, ""Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu."" ""No writer was more important to the soul of The New Yorker than John,"" said David Remnick, the editor of the magazine, in a statement. ""Even though his literary career transcended any magazine -- he was obviously among the very best writers in the world -- he still loved writing for this weekly magazine, loved being part of an enterprise that he joined when he was so young. ""We adored him,""  Remnick continued. ""He was, for so long, the spirit of The New Yorker and it is very hard to imagine things without him."" The magazine said that Updike had written 862 pieces for it over the years, including 327 book reviews, 170 short stories and 154 poems. He was well-regarded in his adopted home state of Massachusetts. ""John Updike's place among America's literary greats is forever secure, as is his special place in every Red Sox fan's heart for his magnificent 'Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu,' "" Sen. John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) said in a statement. ""We honor his memory and his contributions, and Massachusetts today bids him a sad and wistful adieu of our own."" Updike never won a Nobel Prize, but one of his characters, Henry Bech, received one in ""Bech at Bay"" (1998). His works, particularly given their sexual content, could be as divisive as they were poetic. Many critics accused him of misogyny, and others accused him of using his graceful prose to cover thin subject matter -- and Updike put out his prose by the ream. ""It seems to be easier for John Updike to stifle a yawn than to refrain from writing a book,"" the literary critic James Wood wrote in the London Review of Books in 2001. But his frank discussion of sex also garnered him many readers, the cover of Time magazine (for 1968's ""Couples"") and a lifetime achievement Bad Sex in Writing award from Great Britain's Literary Review. He was criticized by Norman Mailer, hailed by fellow author (and Updike obsessive) Nicholson Baker in ""U and I"" and even appeared as an animated version of himself on a ""Simpsons"" episode as the ghostwriter of a Krusty the Klown book. ""[I] was flattered to be asked to be one of the many voices that they worked into the endless saga of Springfield,"" Updike said, noting that the hardest part of his performance was ""producing a chuckle."" John Hoyer Updike was born March 18, 1932, in Reading, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Shillington. From an early age he took to reading and writing, and earned a full scholarship to Harvard, where he headed the Harvard Lampoon. Upon graduation, he accepted a one-year fellowship to Oxford University in England. By the time he was 23, he had been offered a position at The New Yorker, which was to become his literary home over the next 50-plus years. Updike's first novel, ""The Poorhouse Fair,"" came out in 1959. The next year, in ""Rabbit, Run,"" he introduced Angstrom, who was to become one of the most famous characters in American fiction. When introduced, Rabbit is a man fleeing his pregnant wife, the songs on the car radio reflecting both the era and his life. Over the course of the ""Rabbit"" books, the character would routinely infuriate his spouse, mistresses and offspring, try to make things right, and never quite succeed. His attitude didn't help. ""Men are all heart and women are all body. I don't know who has the brains. God maybe,"" the character said in ""Rabbit, Run."" ""Rabbit, Run"" was successful, as were Updike's other '60s books, including ""The Centaur"" (1963), which featured a teacher much like Updike's father, and the short story collection ""The Music School"" (1966). But it was ""Couples"" that made Updike a household name. The book, about a group of spouses engaging in the sexual revolution in suburban Massachusetts, became a No. 1 best-seller. Updike's interests ranged widely. He wrote about an African state in ""The Coup"" (1978). He discussed the relationship between science and religion in ""Roger's Version"" (1986). He revisited ""Hamlet"" in ""Gertrude and Claudius"" (2000). And he created a group of promiscuous witches in ""The Witches of Eastwick"" (1984), which became a hit movie in 1987 starring Jack Nicholson as the devil. Though Updike's work routinely sold well, he was painfully aware of the decline of what's come to be called ""literary fiction."" In a 2000 interview with Salon, he lamented its difficulties. ""When I was a boy, the best-selling books were often the books that were on your piano teacher's shelf. I mean, Steinbeck, Hemingway, some Faulkner. Faulkner actually had, considering how hard he is to read and how drastic the experiments are, quite a middle-class readership,"" he said. ""But certainly someone like Steinbeck was a best-seller as well as a Nobel Prize-winning author of high intent. You don't feel that now."" And yet, Updike himself never lost his zest for the written word, and the pleasure brought by jotting, tuning, refining -- creating -- a new story, even as the years drifted by. ""An aging writer has the not insignificant satisfaction of a shelf of books behind him that, as they wait for their ideal readers to discover them, will outlast him for a while,"" he wrote in AARP The Magazine late last year. ""The pleasures, for him, of book-making ... remain, and retain creation's giddy bliss. Among those diminishing neurons there lurks the irrational hope that the last book might be the best."" Updike's most recent novel, ""The Widows of Eastwick,"" came out in 2008. A collection of stories, ""My Father's Tears and Other Stories,"" is due out later this year.","John Updike, author of ""Rabbit"" books and ""The Witches of Eastwick,"" dies .

ffa8f7f4cf3241f47d20d41fa38a0b69fe71ceef,"Washington (CNN) -- The 2014 elections will continue what has become a staple in American politics: the survival of powerful political families. Bush. Carter. Nunn. Udall. Cheney. These are familiar names from a previous generation -- but also for a new one. When Liz Cheney announced her intention to become the next senator from Wyoming this year, she likely evoked voters' memories of her father, Dick Cheney, the former vice president. The same is true for two politicians in Georgia. Both the daughter of former Sen. Sam Nunn and a grandson of former President Jimmy Carter will be on the 2014 ballot in the Peach State. Michelle Nunn is running for U.S. Senate, while state Sen. Jason Carter has launched a bid for governor -- jobs her father and his grandfather, respectively, once held. ""For their constituents and the American public, those names are a proven quantity, and as time goes on, you see that Americans look back at the history of our political system, and things seem better in hindsight,"" said Dan Mahaffee of the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress. ""It harkens back to a more collegial political era."" Candidates and family heritage . All over the country, candidates with such familiar names are either running for re-election or jumping into races and using their families' vast networks to anchor nascent campaigns. Take a look at the heritage of some of these candidates on the ballot in 2014: . • Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia is running for her state's open U.S. Senate seat. Her father, Arch A. Moore Jr., was governor of West Virginia for 12 years. • Sen. Mary Landrieu is running for re-election in Louisiana. Her father, ""Moon"" Landrieu, was once mayor of New Orleans and a brother, Mitch Landrieu, is now the city's mayor. • George P. Bush is running for Texas land commissioner. A member of one of America's great political dynasties, he's the grandson of former President George H.W. Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush. • Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen of New Jersey is running for re-election. A member of one of the most dominant political families in the United States, Frelinghuysen can trace his roots back to four U.S. senators and Frederick Frelinghuysen, one of New Jersey's delegates to the Continental Congress. • Sen. Mark Pryor, who is running for re-election in Arkansas, is the son of former Sen. David Pryor. • Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, the son of a former congressman, is running for re-election. And so is a cousin, Tom Udall of New Mexico, also a U.S. senator. A 'ready-made Rolodex' ""You grow up around a business, you learn the ropes early,"" CNN contributor Paul Begala said. ""It is the same reason restaurants or hardware stores -- or junkyards -- have names like 'Sanford and Son.' "" Begala cites many benefits to running as the next in line in a political family, but two stand out: a thick skin and fund-raising.

Begala said that relying on relatives' fund-raising networks also is unbelievably helpful for these candidates. Being a Cheney in Wyoming, a Bush in Texas or a Landrieu in Louisiana will open many doors -- and wallets.

American dynasties from the early years on . The number of political families on the ballot in 2014 is nothing new. Since the outset of the United States, political families have dominated certain states, and many have risen to national prominence. The Adamses, with the nation's second president, John Adams, and sixth president, John Quincy Adams, were among the first political families. But certainly not the last. The Republican Tafts have long dominated Ohio politics, boasting three U.S. senators, a president, a governor and countless local positions. The Democratic Kennedy family has dominated politics in New England -- with a president, three presidential candidates, three senators, multiple congressmen and dozens of local elected positions. A 2012 study of the Kennedys' political dominance by the University of Minnesota found the family has logged more than 92 years in congressional service, a number that doesn't even count Joseph P. Kennedy III's recent term as a representative from Massachusetts. Then there are the obvious political families: the Bushes and Clintons. Between 1980 and 2008, a member of one of these families was either president or vice president. Bush and Clinton ""fatigue"" has even become a common term as speculation grows about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both eyeing a run at the presidency in 2016. So why do Americans, the same people who revolted against a monarchy in 1776, keep electing members of the same families? Some political watchers said the continuity these families bring can be comforting to voters, but the public also can sour on candidates who see themselves as anointed successors to their families' political power. Mahaffee, however, said the idea that voters are sick of political families is dispelled by the fact that so many of them exist. Do voters occasionally get sick of one family? Yes, he said. But on the whole, such a history is a good thing for candidates, he said. ""It is helpful that you continue to have generations that bring political experience with them,"" Mahaffee said. ""They have more of a knowledge (of) what it takes to be a political leader.""","A new generation from well-known political families will show up on the 2014 ballot .

ffaa0d4e97465cd65dcfbdcdd813bd0ad31b06af,"By . Simon Tomlinson . Russia may be stripped of assets around the world after an international court ruled it must pay $50billion in compensation for the government's role in destroying the country's largest oil company. Yesterday's verdict by the Permanent Court for Arbitration increases the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia at a time when it faces new, potentially painful sanctions from Western powers. Yukos was once Russia's biggest oil company, but was broken up after anti-Kremlin owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, shortly after President Vladimir Putin warned Russia's growing class of oligarchs against meddling in politics. Scroll down for video . Lawyers acting for shareholders of collapsed Russian oil firm Yukos speak after the Kremlin was ordered to pay $50bn in damages to their clients over its role in destroying the company with outsized tax demands . The court, a body that rules on corporate disputes, said the Russian government owes the money to the former majority shareholders in Yukos Oil Co, which it said was forced into bankruptcy with outsized tax claims by Putin's government. Moscow vowed to fight the decision, raising the prospect of a new round of legal battles as the shareholders seek to enforce the decision by seizing Russian state-owned assets in 150 countries around the world. They can attempt to seize any assets used for commercial purposes. That means that while embassies are safe, planes, art, commercial property, gas pipelines and oil rigs are not. 'It's the end of the beginning,' said Tim Osborne, executive director of GML, formerly Group Menatep Ltd, whose subsidiaries brought the suit to the court based in The Hague, Netherlands. The court said Russia had used tax claims to take control of Yukos in 2003 and silence its CEO, Khodorkovsky, an opponent of Putin who had begun to use his vast wealth to fund opposition parties challenging Putin's power. Yukos was broken up after anti-Kremlin owner Mikhail Khodorkovsky (left) was arrested in 2003 shortly after President Vladimir Putin (right) warned Russia's growing class of oligarchs against meddling in politics . Khodorkovsky was arrested at gunpoint as he boarded a plane in Siberia that year and spent more than a decade in prison as Yukos's main assets were sold to a state-owned company. Yukos ultimately went bankrupt. Monday's ruling, one of the largest commercial arbitration awards in history, adds to Russia's economic problems just as the U.S. and European Union are debating further sanctions against the country because of its support for rebels in eastern Ukraine. Though the country has ample reserves, uncertainty over the impact of the sanctions has seen economic growth forecasts plummet and investors are pulling money out of the country at almost twice the pace as last year. The court's three-member panel, chaired by Yves Fortier, Canada's former permanent representative to the United Nations, determined Russia was not acting in good faith to collect taxes when it levelled massive claims against Yukos, even though some of the company's tax arrangements might have been questionable. The state launched 'a full assault on Yukos and its beneficial owners in order to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets while, at the same time, removing Mr Khodorkovsky from the political arena,' the court said. Broken up: The former Moscow headquarters of Yukos. The court said the Kremlin launched 'a full assault on Yukos and its beneficial owners in order to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets' The blunt verdict accusing the Kremlin of giving the go-ahead to crush one of the nation's biggest companies contrasts sharply with earlier cautious rulings from other international courts, which were carefully phrased to avoid blaming the Russian leadership for destroying Yukos. The dismantling of Yukos and the arrest of Khodorkovsky were a defining moment in Putin's rule. It was then that his government began to take back control of the country's energy industry and sought to re-assert itself internationally as a force to be reckoned with rather than a crumbling post-communist shell. Putin most recently went on to assert Russia's claims over Crimea, annexing the peninsula on the Black Sea in March, and to offer support to rebels in Ukraine's east. But the wake-up call for the West began in the early 2000s, when Putin forged a deal with Russian businessmen who had created empires by snapping up the jewels of the Soviet state in oil, gas and chemicals. The Kremlin offered its protection for the oligarchs' often murky deals. In exchange, the tycoons pledged to not meddle in government policy. Khodorkovsky was the only man who broke this rule. After his imprisonment, Yukos' main assets were ultimately bought up by state-owned Rosneft, making it the largest oil producer in Russia. In Monday's ruling, which was dated July 18, Russia was ordered to pay the damages within 180 days or begin paying interest. If Russia declines to pay, shareholders can attempt to seize Russian assets abroad. 'We're over the first and most important hurdle,' Osborne said. 'It's now a question of enforcing it.' Damning: The verdict by the Permanent Court for Arbitration (above) in The Hague increases the economic and diplomatic isolation of Russia at a time when it faces new sanctions from Western powers . The amount of damages, although half as much as originally claimed, is colossal - nearly as much as Russia spent on the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, the most expensive Olympics in history. Russia's options are limited. Though the arbitration decision is final, it can seek what is called a 'setting aside' of the award before courts in the Netherlands. The threshold for review is high, however, and lawyers for GML said they were confident Russia had no chance on that front. The Russian finance ministry said it would take that path, fight what it called a one-sided and political verdict in the other courts in the Netherlands. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Russian authorities 'will use all possible legal means to defend their position.' Leonid Nevzlin, the top beneficiary of a trust controlling GML that has launched the suit, told Ekho Moskvy radio shareholders would search for and freeze Russian assets around the world if Moscow doesn't pay up. Nevzlin pointed at a suit won by a Swiss company, Noga, which claimed $1.1 billion from Russia and led to seizures of Russian assets worldwide in 2008. It eventually forced Moscow to opt for a settlement. Khodorkovsky, who had given his stock in Yukos to Nevzlin, said the ruling will make a 'strong impression' on Putin, saying his lieutenants had sought to downplay the likelihood of such an outcome. 'I'm sure that they haven't told Putin how disastrous the ruling will be, and I'm very happy today,' he said on Ekho Moskvy. Though the case has been a decade in the making, the timing of its release is unfortunate for Russia, experts said. Between the crisis in Ukraine, the possibility of sanctions and the payment of a massive judgment on Yukos, investors in Russia now face 'the perfect storm,' said Gianna Bern, who teaches finance at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. Bern said that while Russia could probably handle paying $50 billion, not paying could prove more problematic. 'Foreign investors are going to be on the sidelines waiting to see how they handle this,' she said. 'They will look at this and see if the Russian Federation respects the rule of law.' The main stock index in Moscow fell almost 2 per cent on Monday. Rosneft said in a statement it is not party to the litigation and it did not expect to be affected by it. It believes the deals to purchase former assets of Yukos 'were fully legitimate.' Shares in Rosneft were down 3.6 percent in trading in London. Monday's decision is not the only one facing Russia this week. The European Court of Human Rights is set to rule on Thursday on another Yukos lawsuit - one involving 55,000 shareholders that were not part of the GML group. This group includes $6 billion in investments by U.S. pension funds and other institutions. No one involved seems to think this is even close to over, with lawyers on all sides taking up positions. 'The Yukos affair is likely to come back to haunt the Russians,' said Anders Aslund, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute in Washington and a long-time Russia watcher. 'You don't steal companies.'","Russia used outsized tax claims to bankrupt country's largest oil firm .

The defender was due to play in Euro 2016 qualifiers against Bulgaria on Friday and Azerbaijan on Monday but sustained a problem in training which has ruled him out. 'During training on Wednesday, Lovren felt pain in the abdominal wall. Igor Boric (a specialist) at St Catherine (Hospital) showed there was a tear and he will not be ready for performances in Sofia and Osijek,' said a statement on the Croatian Football Federation's website. Dejan Lovren will return to Liverpool to have his abdominal injury assessed by their medical team . The centre back suffered an abdominal injury while on international duty with Croatia . Dejan Lovren has pulled out of Croatia's squad with an abdominal tear and Mamadou Sakho has a thigh problem meaning Liverpool potentially have only two fit centre halves - Martin Skrtel and the error-prone Kolo Toure. Lovren is set to return to Merseyside in the next couple of days, where he will be further assessed by the medical team at the club's Melwood training ground. Liverpool have had contact with Croatia, but until their own staff have examined the defender they cannot make a diagnosis on the injury. The Premier League club have 10 days before their next match and if Lovren's injury is only minor then it may actually benefit them to have him back early to prepare for the trip to QPR. It is the second successive month Liverpool have had players injured on international duty. Lovren dives in to challenge Saido Berahino during Saturday's 2-1 win over West Brom at Anfield . Manager Brendan Rodgers has publicly expressed his displeasure at England's handling of striker Daniel Sturridge, who sustained a thigh injury in training which has caused him to miss the last seven matches. Last month Rodgers also lost Joe Allen, who injured a knee while with Wales, and fellow midfielder Emre Can, who has been sidelined since picking up an ankle injury in the latter stages of Germany Under-21s' 8-0 win over Romania. Rodgers is confident Sturridge will be fit for the trip to QPR but Lovren's problem, coupled with a thigh injury to Mamadou Sakho sustained in training just days after he walked out of Anfield having been omitted from the squad for the Merseyside derby, means his only two fit central defenders are Martin Skrtel - currently with Slovakia for matches against Spain and Belarus - and Kolo Toure.

But now locals including David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks are poised to welcome a surprising addition to their town – Aldi. The budget foodstore has won planning permission to build an outlet on scrubland just 500 metres from the genteel High Street in the Cotswolds town. Aldi is planning to open a new store in the upmarket Chipping Norton, just off the town's High Street (file picture) It’s the latest sign of the middle classes turning in increasing numbers to Aldi and fellow German discount supermarket Lidl for their shopping. And the new store will give the Prime Minister the opportunity to counter accusations of elitism after he revealed himself to prefer Waitrose shopping earlier this year. Addressing John Lewis staff in April, he said: ‘I shop at various different supermarkets. I’m going to be honest with you. ‘When I’m at home in the constituency, I go to Sainsbury’s in Chipping Norton, because there isn’t a Waitrose. The Prime Minister had previously revealed himself to be a Waitrose customer . ‘When I’m having a day in the central town in my constituency, I go to Waitrose in Witney.’ Chipping Norton’s mayor Mike Tysoe said the new budget store has had an almost unanimous welcome from residents. He said: ‘It ticks all the boxes across the board in the community. The area isn’t just a chocolate box picture. There are a great many rural families on very tight budgets. ‘A lot of them go once or twice a month to Aldi in Banbury for a big shop. That’s a 28-mile round trip. They are extremely happy that they’ll no longer have to do that.’ Chipping Norton is not the only middle class bastion Aldi is set to gain a foothold in, with plans for 48 new stores this year – more than any of the other supermarkets. Other wealthy spots earmarked for the no-frills retailer include Harrogate in North Yorkshire, Epsom in Surrey and Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Lidl, too, is expanding with plans for 15 more UK shops this year, including in upmarket places like Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire.","Budget chain given go-ahead to build a store in exclusive Chipping Norton .

ffab306c36c145d7f705fdafd034b9f33d42dd54,"Aboard Development Driller III, Gulf of Mexico (CNN) -- The news? They can't watch it anymore. Outsiders criticizing their progress, saying they're not working fast enough or smart enough -- it's too much to bear. They understand how awful the situation is. They are, after all, working on the waters where friends and relatives died. Those losses, and the stories they hear from workers who survived the Deepwater Horizon explosion, are with them every day. It's a weight they carry as the world watches. These men and women are working to drill a relief well -- 16,000 to 18,000 feet below the seafloor, Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen says. It is the only surefire way to stop the oil that's spewing into the Gulf of Mexico. ""It takes time to dig a relief well safely and efficiently, which is what we're trying to do,"" Capt. Lee Crowe says. ""Our goal is to stem the flow of oil -- the long-term solution, not the short-term solution."" As of Thursday, BP says the drill for this relief well has reached a depth of 13,978 feet. See a BP image of both relief well statuses, last updated on May 30 . There are fewer than 200 workers on board at any one time. They are marine biologists, scientists, construction and tool experts. They must understand the physics of what they're doing. Simple hired hands? Not even close. They work on the rig in three-week shifts, living in simple quarters and eating in a space not unlike a school cafeteria. Mementos from home, pictures of the families they leave behind to do this work, appear on desks. Most of them come from Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas -- the very places that will be hardest hit by the oil-riddled waters. So for them, what they're doing is more than a job, the kind of job that's been passed on through generations. They are trying to protect their own homes. And they're trying to right what has gone so horribly wrong. ""Part of the problem is that there is a lot of outside scrutiny on what it is that we're doing out here,"" Capt. Nick Schindler says. ""The American population is wanting this well done. They want it now. We all want it done now. But we all have to understand that this is a well that killed 11 people ... and sunk a rig. So we're not going to speed up, and we're going to do this as safe as possible."" To get to where disaster struck on April 20 takes a one-hour helicopter ride from New Orleans, Louisiana. From the air, heading out there, one can see efforts to contain the spreading oil. Large floating booms arc in the water to absorb the crude. The large black slicks or dark pools one might expect to see are not visible. Instead there are orange pancake-like deposits, the result of oil that's been exposed to the elements. Allen, during the flight, notices what no outsider can. The shifting winds change the flow trajectory in the water. Based on this, he predicts Pensacola, Florida, will be hit with oil in a couple of days. A couple of days later, it is. But the smell -- like fresh tar -- can't be missed by anyone. It only grows stronger as the Coast Guard helicopter reaches its destination, landing on Development Driller III. Across the water, Development Driller II works on the backup relief well, while Discover Enterprise tries to cap the gushing oil. It is beneath that rig that underwater cameras are trained on the oil the world is seeing. Support vessels between the three rigs are busy offering their own help to the massive effort.

Miss Teen USA California Cassidy Wolf arrives to the Premiere of ""Wiener Dog Nationals"" at Pacific Theatre at The Grove on June 18, 2013 in Los Angeles, California . A 19-year-old Southern California computer science student pleaded guilty Tuesday to hacking the computers of Miss Teen USA and other women and secretly photographing them with their own webcams. Jared James Abrahams, of Temecula, answered a series of questions from U.S. District Judge James Selna in an Orange County courtroom, including an explanation of the crimes that were committed. 'I hacked several girls' computers and, using their webcams, took photos of them when they weren't aware,' Abrahams said meekly. Abrahams pleaded guilty to three counts of extortion and one count of unauthorized access of a computer. He faces up to 11 years in prison and fines of up to $1 million when he's sentenced in March. Over the past two years, Abrahams hacked into the computers of at least a dozen women in their late teens or early 20s from various states and countries, including Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf. The pair attended Great Oaks High School together for four years, . graduating in 2012. Scroll Down for Video . Guilty: Jared James Abrahams appears outside the Santa Ana, CA., court in September after posting $50,000 bail for his release . Court records say he also sent the women anonymous emails telling them he had downloaded nude photos of them. He told them he would publish the images on social media sites if they didn't send him additional pictures or undress for him. If the women complied, Abrahams promised to destroy the images. At least two of his victims gave in to his demands, authorities said. 'Did you know you were extorting them when you made these demands?' Selna asked. 'Yes,' Abrahams responded. Dressed in matching gray pants and shirt with a black jacket, Abrahams told the judge he has autism and has been under treatment for the past 10 years. He said he was on three medications Tuesday, but he said they wouldn't affect his ability to enter a guilty plea. Outside court, his attorney Alan Eisner said Abrahams apologizes for his actions. He said the autism played a contributing role in the scheme. 'The social disorder had, certainly, a part in it,' Eisner said. 'Again, I say that not to blame the conduct on anything, not to make an excuse for the conduct, but that's part of the full picture.' In Wolf's case, Abrahams was able to take nude photos of her without her knowledge, authorities said. He posted a naked photo of Wolf online after she didn't respond to him. Watch Video Here: . [captio . According to an FBI affidavit, Abrahams told Wolf: 'Your dream of being a model will be transformed into a pornstar.' Wolf, also 19 and a graduate of Great Oak High School in Temecula, won the Miss Teen USA crown in August. She has spoken publicly about the incident, saying she would use her fame to highlight cybercrime. Abrahams is accused of employing similar hacking tactics used by a Florida man who was sentenced to 10 years in prison last year after he broke into the personal online accounts of Scarlett Johansson, Christina Aguilera and other women and posted revealing photos and other material online. In September, Wolf told the website of NBC's ""Today"" show that earlier this year she received an anonymous email in which the sender claimed to have stolen images from the camera on her home computer. The sender of the email threatened to go public with images captured from Wolf's webcam unless she would provide nude pictures of herself, Eimiller said - a crime commonly known as 'sextortion.' Instead, Wolf went to authorities, and an investigation was launched in March. Shock: Cassidy Wolf, from California, was crowned as Miss Teen USA 2013 in the Bahamas . A federal complaint filed on Sept. 17 and unsealed Thursday charges Jared James Abrahams with extortion but Eimiller said other charges are possible. An FBI agent's affidavit, included in the complaint, contends that Abrahams used malicious software to remotely operate webcams to capture nude photos and videos of at least seven women as they changed clothes - some of whom he knew personally and others he found by hacking Facebook pages. The agent alleged that Abrahams, when interviewed, acknowledged controlling 30 to 40 hacked computers and extorting some women. Abrahams, a college freshman majoring in computer science, allegedly would use the women's webcams to capture nude images, then send emails threatening to post them on their hacked social media accounts unless they either sent him nude photos, a nude video, or logged onto the Skype video chat service and follow his orders for five minutes.

He allegedly threatened Wolf that unless she heeded his demands, he would release her nude photos 'all over the Internet' and 'your dream of being a model will be transformed into a pornstar.' According to the affidavit, the victims included several women from other countries. One teenager in Ireland responded to the demands by writing: 'Please remember I'm 17. Have a heart,' according to the court record. Abrahams allegedly responded: 'I'll tell you this right now! I do NOT have a heart. However, I do stick to my deals.

The school leavers' ball - or prom, as they are increasingly called - is one of the landmark events in a teenage . girl's life, marking the end of years of hard work. It has become a crucial rite of passage for teenagers everywhere. But for 16-year-old Terri Calvesbert her school prom was even more significant than most. Terri was scarred for life in a devastating fire at her home in Ipswich, Suffolk, when she was a two-year-old baby. Big celebration: Terri Calvesbert, 16, who was scarred for life after being caught in a house fire aged two, dressed up for her school leavers' prom with her friends and said she had a 'wonderful evening' But as Terri leaves her school days behind and heads off to college in September, she joined her friends from Westbourne Academy at its school prom in Henley at the weekend. And, of course, there was only one way for the excited teen to arrive in style - in a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce. Like most other teenagers, she was slightly nervous before the prom, but once on her way, Terri had a great time. She said: 'It was really nice to be with my friends and with the teachers. It was a wonderful evening. Having a ball: Terri Calvesbert and students from the former Westbourne Sports College enjoyed their evening held at All Manor of Events in Henley . 'There were more than 100 people there and it was just great to have such a good night out.' Her whole family turned out to see Terri head off to the big evening - father Paul, 40, was joined by his wife Nicky, 45, and grandparents Mick and Margaret. And when Terri arrived at the school prom at All Manor of Events at Henley she was the star of the show as she was cheered by her school friends. The teenager is now hoping to relax . during the summer before learning how she has done in her GCSE exams . when the results come out next month.

Paul said he had been very proud to see his precious daughter go off to the prom and enjoy life like any other teenager . Terri Calvesbert nearly died from 90 per cent burns after the fire when she was just 23 months old when her mother accidentally left a lit cigarette in her bedroom. Firefighters attending the scene thought they had found a 'charred doll' when they saw Terri's body. Horrifically, the only part of her body that escaped burns was the patch of skin protected by her wet nappy. Doctors at specialist burns unit in . Chelmsford thought Terri Calvesbert, then just 18 months old, would die . from the burns, but incredibly, she pulled through. Terri lost her hair, nose and eyelids in . the devastating blaze. Her mother, Ms Minter, then 32, was so wracked with guilt after the episode that she cut off almost all contact with her husband and daughter.

ffacbfe622ca2f9c6f067bd77af0af2c27aea25d,"Facebook, owned by Mark Zuckerberg, has been accused of 'refusing to listen' to the voice of the British public . Facebook 'refused to listen to the voice' of the British public by channelling profits through Ireland to avoid  the taxman in the UK, an MP said last night. The move by the social network meant it paid just £1.8million in Irish tax on more than £2.3billion of global sales, but none in Britain. The accusation came as details of the social network's efforts to avoid paying UK tax emerged, just days after Chancellor George Osborne announced a crackdown on multinational companies using 'elaborate structures' to avoid paying up. Around 46 per cent (£2.35billion) of Facebook's global sales where channelled through Ireland - allowing the company to make profits of £2.3billion. Its tax bill was reduced further by paying £2.29billion in 'administrative expenses' to Facebook's parent company, The Guardian reported. Shifting the money meant Mark Zuckerberg's company only paid the equivalent of £1.81million in Irish tax on taxable profits of £5.76million. By channelling its UK sales through Ireland, Facebook has avoided paying any tax in Britain for two years running - despite 33 million Brits having accounts. Labour MP Margaret Hodge, chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said Facebook was 'still refusing to listen to the voice of public opinion'. She added that the social network appeared to be 'using elaborate corporate structures and artificial devices for no purpose other than to avoid tax'. Ms Hodge said: 'We have to take tough to crack down on this behaviour, and the UK should be leading the way on this issue.' The UK boss of Starbucks, which has only paid £8.6m tax despite making £3billion in British sales since it first opened its doors in 1998, also admitted this week that it would not start paying corporation tax for the next three years. Google paid £20m in UK tax last year despite its British revenue totalling £5.6billion. Facebook paid just £1.8million in tax on more than £2.3billion of advert sales channelled through Ireland, avoiding the UK taxman for the second year running . Chancellor George Osborne, in his Autumn Statement on Wednesday, announced a measure, dubbed the 'Google tax', which will impose a 25 per cent levy on profits shifted abroad by multinational companies. It is hoped that the measure will raise more than £1billion over the next five years. He said: 'Some of the largest companies in the world, including those in the tech sector, use elaborate structures to avoid paying taxes. 'That's not fair to other British firms. It's not fair to British people either. Today we're putting a stop to it. My message is consistent and clear: low taxes, but low taxes that will be paid.' Facebook have been contacted for comment.","Facebook paid £1.8million in Irish tax on more than £2.3billion global sales .

The Olympics commentator, 29, revealed the split on Twitter on Wednesday, writing: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.' The couple, who were married two years ago, parted ways after Weir's packed schedule meant he was too busy to spend time or take a vacation with his attorney husband, TMZ Sports reported. Divorcing: Johnny Weir (right) has broken up with husband Victor Voronov (left). The former ice-skating champion announced the split Wednesday on Twitter . Violence at home: The couple appeared together earlier this month to get a domestic dispute case dismissed. Voronov accused Weir of biting him about a month before the Olympics . Voronov had supported his husband's . career, according to the site, but they had only seen each other two or . three times in the past month and their plans for a holiday were repeatedly stalled. Their relationship also ran into trouble recently when Voronov accused Weir of biting him in a police report. But . the couple put on a united front when they convinced a New Jersey judge . to throw out the domestic dispute case earlier this month. The former figure skater, whose commentary during Sochi established him as one of its biggest stars, appeared to still be with Voronov when they attended Lyndhurst Municipal Court on March 4 to get the case dismissed. Voronov, a lawyer, filed a police report about a month before the Olympics claiming the former ice skating champion had bit him, a source told RadarOnline. The pair put . on a united front, with Voronov placing his hand on his husband's knee . and whispering into his ear, the website reported. Happier times: Weir and Voronov got married on New Year's Eve 2011, shortly after the former figure skater came out as gay . Weir, dressed in an unusually somber black outfit, caught the attention of the judge, who commented 'Nice hairdo!' as he approached the bench. The couple asked the Lyndhurst Municipal Court judge to dismiss the case, and it was granted. Leaving the court, Weir told Radar: 'It is a private matter I do not wish to discuss.' Police and court officials declined to reveal further details because it is a domestic dispute case. Weir officially came out as . gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay . suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality. On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov, a Georgetown Law graduate. Stars of Sochi: Weir and fellow skater Tara Lipinski were applauded for their colorful commentary in Sochi . Popular: Weir scored fans with his quirky wardrobe, left, and an invitation with Lipinksi to the Oscars, right . Ahead of the nuptials, Weir told . IceNetwork that Voronov, who comes from a Russian family but grew up in . Atlanta, was 'kind of everything that I've ever looked for and aspired . to be in a relationship with'. He went on: 'We've known for a long time and we reconnected over the summer, and it's just been a whirlwind. 'He's . wonderful. He's in the legal field, completely separate from all of my . razzle dazzle. He loves watching me perform and seeing what I actually . do.' But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery. 'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'

His glamorous media image and radical ideas have seen him dubbed the ‘rock star’ economist. But Thomas Piketty – whose bestselling book, Capital In The Twenty-First Century, has been hailed by Unite union boss Len McCluskey and Ed Miliband’s most trusted adviser, Stewart Wood – is actually a woman beater, a ex-lover has claimed. Aurelie Filippetti, 40, France’s glamorous Culture and Media Minister, had a relationship with Mr Piketty, 42, which she alleges came to a violent end. A Socialist Party source, who was . close to the couple when they shared a flat on Paris’s Left Bank, said: . ‘Frankly, she views him as a woman beater who used violence as a . solution to their domestic problems. The details of what Thomas did to . Aurélie are quite shocking – they drove her to contemplate suicide. ‘Many . believed the complaints about Thomas were politically motivated, but . Aurelie herself spoke about them often in private. She was desperate to . bring Thomas to justice. ‘It was one of the darkest periods of her life.’ Although the pair have both attempted . to keep their private lives a secret, records show that on February 6, . 2009, Ms Filippetti attended a Paris police station to lodge a complaint . about an attack. Soon . afterwards Mr Piketty was investigated for ‘violence between domestic . partners’ – a crime that carries a jail sentence of up to 14 years. At the time, Ms Filippetti was  a spokeswoman for the Socialist Party, then in opposition, which Mr Piketty was also advising on economic policy. Both were close to Segolene Royal, the party’s 2007 presidential candidate and the mother of president Francois Hollande’s four children. An investigating officer confirmed: ‘The . complaint was examined very thoroughly. The accuser was in a very . distressed state on the day she attended the police station and did not . leave until close to midnight.’ Arrested: Thomas Piketty confirmed he had been arrested and held in custody but disputed the allegations . Police also confirmed  that the accusations included Ms Filippetti ‘having been hit’ and that she had  a medical examination. Mr Piketty was formally charged on March 17, 2009. But the politician then asked for the charges to be dropped – apparently because she did not want her daughter Clara, now 15, to hear details of the claims. Mr Piketty – a professor at  the Paris School of Economics – originally described the claims  as ‘stories from the gutter’. A . spokesman for Ms Filippetti said: ‘Mr Piketty has recognised the facts . of the violence against Ms Filippetti  and apologised, so in the . interests of the families  and children she did  not proceed.’ Last . night Mr Piketty confirmed he had been arrested and held in custody but . disputed the allegations: ‘The case closed five years ago.

Damaging: Oliver Robbins, the deputy national security adviser, said articles based on confidential files leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden, pictured, exposed the capabilities of the intelligence and security agencies . Newspaper stories based on stolen top secret documents have caused ‘real and serious damage’ to Britain’s national security, a senior official warned yesterday. Oliver Robbins, the deputy national security adviser, said articles based on confidential files leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden exposed the capabilities of the intelligence and security agencies. As a result, they risked helping terrorists evade detection and endangering the lives of British service personnel. His stark warning came at the start of a judicial review into the use of counter-terrorism powers to detain and question David Miranda, the partner of Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald, by the police and Security Service earlier this year. Mr Miranda was stopped at Heathrow Airport on August 18 and found to be carrying 58,000 documents, part of the cache stolen by Mr Snowden from the US National Security Agency. He was held for nine hours. He later revealed he had no idea what he was carrying for Mr Greenwald, prompting descriptions of him as a ‘document mule’. Matthew Ryder QC, for Mr Miranda, told the High Court yesterday that the use of the Terrorism Act 2000 to seize the materials was a ‘disproportionate interference with his right to freedom of expression’. The Home Office argues that MI5 had a duty to stop him and seize the documents to protect national security. In a written submission handed to the court, Mr Robbins said the Government was ‘extremely concerned’ about the damaging reporting attributed to the highly classified material stolen by Edward Snowden.’ He said it risked making it easier for ‘foreign states to identify our intelligence officers and take steps against them’ The hearing, before Lord Justice Laws, Mr Justice Ouseley and Mr Justice Openshaw, concludes tomorrow.

ffaf543a85f184924875612822f9811f021d18b1,"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- After the Republicans and Democrats met at the White House summit on health care, it was clear that the parties are very far away from a bipartisan agreement. Indeed, few participants walked away with the sense that they were any closer to a deal. The White House did make clear that it was willing to move forward on health care without Republican support. The choice now becomes whether Democrats should use the budget reconciliation process to pass some parts of health care legislation. According to recent reports, Democrats are considering having the House pass the bill that was already approved in the Senate and then dealing with a package of additional reforms through reconciliation. Programs that are considered under the reconciliation process are not subject to a Senate filibuster. Democrats would only need 51 votes, not 60, to pass those parts of the bill that are included under reconciliation. Reconciliation was created through the Budget Reform Act of 1974 in an effort to streamline the budget process, strengthen the ability of Congress to make tough decisions regarding deficits, and to make legislative decision-making more efficient. Congress quickly expanded on the types of measures that could be considered under reconciliation until 1985 and 1986, when the Senate passed rules proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd that limited what could or could not be included when using this process. Before moving forward, Democrats must consider two questions. The first is whether using reconciliation to pass health care is legitimate or an abuse of the process. Republicans have charged that this would be akin to forcing the program through the chamber rather than passing the bill through negotiation and compromise. On this question, the answer is easy. Reconciliation has been as much a part of the Senate in the past three decades as the filibuster. According to an article that was published in The New Republic, Congress passed 22 reconciliation bills between 1980 and 2008. Many important policy changes were enacted through this process, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, COBRA (which allows people who switch jobs to keep their health care), student aid reform, expansions in Medicaid and several major tax cuts. NPR's Julie Rovner reported that most of the health care reforms enacted in the past two decades have gone through reconciliation. President Ronald Reagan was one of the first presidents to make aggressive use of reconciliation when he pushed through his economic program in 1981. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker said then that speed had been essential because ""Every day that this is delayed makes it more difficult to pass. This is an extraordinary proposal, and these are extraordinary times."" Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all used reconciliation as well. It is worth noting that these presidents, particularly George W. Bush, also made use of sweeping executive power to circumvent Congress altogether. The second question is more difficult and it involves perceptions. If the Democratic leadership wants to use this tactic, they have to convince enough members of their own party that this won't scare off independent voters. This argument was harder to make in 2009 than in 2010. But after a year of dealing with paralysis in the Senate and highly effective Republican obstruction, more Democrats are coming on board. The leadership must be proactive in responding to the criticism about reconciliation. They will have to explain that reconciliation is a legitimate process by pointing to the history. They will also have to connect the dots for voters frustrated with the ineffective government by explaining that the constant use of the filibuster has turned the Senate into a supermajority institution where both parties have found it extraordinarily difficult -- virtually impossible -- to pass major legislation.On this point, Republicans and Democrats actually agree. Indeed, as Democrats make this decision, Kentucky Republican Senator Jim Bunning is objecting to a unanimous consent order and single-handedly preventing the Senate from passing an important bill to assist unemployed workers. Democrats must also convince hesitant colleagues that the payoff could be greater than the cost. While, in the short-term, Republicans will complain that their opponents have rammed through social policy in some sort of unnatural procedural move, Democrats are facing these kinds of intense attacks anyway. Right now, Democrats are receiving the brunt of Republican attacks without being able to pass much legislation. If they pass health care, they will be able to respond to the arguments of the GOP, not just by complaining that Republicans obstruct everything, but by pointing to specific benefits such as lowering premiums by expanding how many people purchase coverage and bringing tens of millions of Americans into the health care system. In certain respects, the White House made the use of reconciliation more difficult by initially accepting the notion that 60 votes were needed to pass legislation through the Senate. After the election of Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, a decision to refocus on procedures that only depend on 51 votes makes it more vulnerable to the attacks of manipulating the process. But in other respects, the administration now has a better political opportunity to use reconciliation. After a year, the public has seen just how dysfunctional Senate procedures can be in an era when filibusters are common. With a public that is frustrated by Washington, as the polls show, the Democrats might be able to persuade a sufficient number of their colleagues to go along. If they don't, one thing is for certain: Democrats will go into election day facing voters who are hearing all the complaints about their party but seeing very little in terms of what they can deliver on health care. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","Democrats are considering using method to pass health bill with 50, not 60 Senate votes .

ffaf87434ec292480b9b2283a379e4af47c9b259,"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 17:30 EST, 7 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 20:54 EST, 7 March 2014 . When it comes to 'corporate firefighting' and 'pan-functional team-building', there's only one man for the job - Ian Fletcher, Hugh Bonneville's hilariously incompetent Head of Deliverance in the Olympics comedy Twenty Twelve. And now he's back in a brand new sitcom that will have us falling about with laughter again, even if we haven't got a clue what he's on about. This time, in W1A, he has the bigwigs at Broadcasting House in his sights - or as Hugh puts it, he aims to 'clarify, define, or re-define the core purpose of the BBC across all its functions'. Ian Fletcher arrives at the BBC with his trusty bike in the new comedy W1A . Twenty Twelve, which ran for two series and won a Best Sitcom BAFTA, was a runaway success, sending up the London 2012 Games and the managerial chaos behind them. The show launched to tiny audiences on BBC4 and quickly became a word-of-mouth success, as the understated humour and all-too-believable characters caught on. But after it transferred to BBC2, millions caught up with the running gags about jargon and managerial incompetence. The big-name stars helped - not just Hugh, whose character was in charge of everything from publicity to traffic lights, but Olivia Colman, who played his long-suffering PA and ardent admirer Sally Owen. She was the only efficient person in the Olympic Deliverance HQ and all the work fell on her shoulders, but she was willing to do anything for her beloved boss. Olivia Coleman won a BAFTA for her role as Sally Owen in Twenty Twelve . Her performance won Olivia a BAFTA too, for Best Female Comedy Performance. The show was never expected to have a sequel - 'The clue to that was in the name,' jokes writer and director John Morton. But . it won such acclaim that inevitably some of its central characters have . found themselves in new careers... and where better than the BBC? 'I never expected there to be a sequel to Twenty Twelve, the clue is in the name' John Morton . W1A's premise is simple. Swamped by bad headlines and desperate for the licence fee to be renewed, the governors of the BBC need someone to steady the ship. And of course, since the Olympics were such a success, they bring in Ian Fletcher - unaware of all the behind-the-scenes disasters he'd been embroiled in... or had caused. With a wry smile, Hugh says that the BBC has been offered 'a lot of learning opportunities in recent years' - management-speak for the catalogue of crises that have engulfed the corporation. 'It was only a matter of time before the BBC reached out for a new Head of Values - and Ian was the man for the job,' says Hugh, who promises that his folding bicycle, the perfect symbol for his eco-friendly ethics and ridiculous image, will also make a comeback... even if his character still hasn't mastered the technique of folding it without severing a finger. The first obstacle he encounters when he arrives at Broadcasting House is the BBC's new 'hot-desking' policy that allows anyone to work anywhere, meaning they must lug their laptops around with them too. 'In the first episode, I think the defining message is how to find a desk,' says Hugh. The writer of Twenty Twelve, John Morton, said he never expected to create a sequel . 'Because the wonderful, open-plan, hot-desking principle at the BBC, which really doesn't allow you to sit down for any longer than five minutes, keeps the corporation quite literally on its toes. Ian is very keen to get the message across that his office door is always open, the only downfall being that there is no office.' John Morton, who created both Twenty Twelve and W1A, calls Hugh 'the funniest straight-man actor in Britain. He's consistently funny, even when he's not saying anything. My favourite moments are when another character is talking nonsense and the camera cuts to Hugh. Before he says a line, the comedy effect has been doubled by the expression on his face. The secret lies behind his eyes. Hugh brings a really elusive quality - he's able to give you access to what he must be thinking but not saying.' With the BBC 'brand' set to be such a crucial worldwide asset, they also hire the jargon-spouting PR consultant who handled the Olympics publicity - Siobhan Sharpe (played by Jessica Hynes) who is Ian's biggest nightmare. It's a chance for the characters (who cordially loathe each other) to 're-meet and recalibrate their relationship', as Hugh puts it with a laugh. Siobhan's greatest regret is that she isn't American. She doesn't do lunch, or relationships - they're both for wimps - and when she opens her mouth, verbiage tumbles out. 'If you get bandwidth on this, you've got maple syrup on your waffle at the get-go.' And there are new characters, including a Head of Output with the power to veto any programme, played by Sarah Parish. Sarah's career has been in overdrive for the past year, including a starring role in the Saturday teatime blockbuster Atlantis; in W1A she gets to play a blustering bully called Anna. 'She's this high-powered, frightening, intimidating, very definite person,' explains Sarah. 'When she makes a decision, she makes it. Unfortunately it's always wrong! She's good at talking the talk. When Ian Fletcher arrives, Anna is quite defensive: she's suspicious of him, just in case he actually does know what he's talking about!' Jessica Hynes will return as her character Siobhan in W1A . Real-life BBC executives might be expected to feel more than a little anxious about a satire set in their own offices. But Morton insists the top brass have left the actors to get on with it, and that senior managers have not even asked to see a script, let alone demanded cuts or rewrites. It might ruffle a few feathers, though, he warns. 'This is certainly no love letter to the BBC, but it is a gentle satire. It's benign... even if that's not fashionable.' It's more than just a laugh at the BBC's expense, even though the title is a direct reference to the postcode of Broadcasting House in London, where the series was actually filmed. The cast hope that, as with Twenty Twelve, millions of viewers will spot the resemblance to their own working lives. 'Twenty Twelve was about satirising management structure and management speak,' says Hugh, . 'and all the pitfalls of a team trying to do something en masse when all people are doing is passing the buck. The same flavour is there in W1A - we're not deriding the BBC but we are having an interesting look at the way some decisions are reached. This could quite easily have been set in the NHS or Whitehall.' Ian Bonneville and Jessica Hynes will return to our screens this month in W1A . But the satire neatly skewers the BBC's addiction to jargon and meaningless titles, as executive producer Jon Plowman admits. 'I was asked 20 years ago to be Head of Broken Comedy, which meant non-narrative sketch shows. I said I didn't want to be head of anything broken, so a title had to be invented  - I was made Head of Comedy Entertainment, which then suggested comedy existed that wasn't entertainment.' He took the precaution, before W1A started filming, of confirming with Tony Hall, the director-general, that there were no plans to appoint a real-life Head of Values, and was told the post would remain vacant... at least as long as W1A was on the air. Jon's own title now is Executive Producer. As he defines it, 'The producer's the guy who does the day-to-day work; the executive producer is the guy who gets the credit.' Viewers who missed Twenty Twelve should not expect a glib comedy packed with one-liners. The dialogue in W1A is stuttering: characters start to say something and get bogged down in their own incoherence. 'With comedy there are 100 ways to set up . a situation, and 99 of them simply aren't funny. Finding the right one . is the hardest work imaginable' John Morton . Often they suddenly cut off in mid-sentence, aware that they shouldn't give voice to whatever they're thinking. It's subtle, and all too easy to relate to, with a twinge of embarrassment. But despite the stumbling and the mumbling, there's no improvisation by the cast in W1A - nor was there in Twenty Twelve. Every 'umm' and 'err' is scripted. That puts huge pressure on the actors, because in a scene with five or six people, it only takes one tiny error, one word a second too early, and they have to start again. 'The show might look like it happened to fall together,' Morton says, 'but getting it precisely right take after take is exhausting. And that process continues in the editing suite - comedy focuses on the tiniest of details. With drama you might tell a scene in ten different ways, but with comedy there are 100 ways to set up a situation, and 99 of them simply aren't funny. Finding the right one is the hardest work imaginable - and if it flops, everyone notices.' The question every Twenty Twelve fan will be asking is what's happened to Ian's doting PA Sally (Olivia Colman). Sadly, she isn't returning, though the writer does promise viewers will learn what happened between Sally and Ian on their fateful trip to Italy at the end of the last series. But love, or perhaps a catastrophic office affair, is on the horizon for the BBC's new Head of Values. Whether his career can withstand it is an outcome that, as Ian might say, will be determined following the appraisal of the blue sky interpersonal reassessment session. In other words... wait and see. W1A will air on BBC2 later this month.","The award winning comedy - Twenty Twelve - returns to our screens .

The former attorney for Penn state football coach Jerry Sandusky has been charged with stealing $535,135 of his clients' money, which he used to fund gambling trips at casinos and other personal interests. Karl Rominger, 41, who represented Sandusky during his child-sex abuse trial, allegedly misappropriated funds from clients that include a car accident victim, the spouse of a divorced couple and the survivors of a woman's estate. Rominger apologized to the former clients he had 'wronged'. 'I look forward to accepting the consequences and putting this behind me, while making restitution,' he said, according to PennLive.com. Cumberland County investigators filed 25 charges for theft and fund misappropriation on Friday. They said Rominger could still face more charges as the investigation is not yet complete. In his affidavit, chief detective Les Freehling wrote that Rominger's financial records were in such a state of 'disarray' that it had been hard to account for additional possible losses. Rominger came under investigation last year after he failed to materialize $147,883 from the sale of a marital home during a divorce case, Freehling said. It was then discovered that $800,000 in client money was missing from a bank account under the former attorney's control. Rominger, who said he hasn't gambled since last March, voluntarily surrendered his law license and is currently free on $250,000 bail. District Attorney David Freed said there is still at least 'one other substantial situation' being investigated. He added that investigators have also yet to be given access to all of Rominger's files due to claims of attorney-client privilege. Rominger represented former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky during his child-sex abuse trial. The former attorney voluntarily surrendered his law license last spring .","Karl Rominger, 41, misappropriated funds from clients including a car accident victim, a spouse in a divorce case, and survivors from an estate .

One of the men then lit a lighter and his friend’s T-shirt, which was soaked with the aftershave, burst into flames. The fireball was put out by his horrified friends who rolled him on the floor. Long John's Showbar on the Britannia Pier in Great Yarmouth, where the man was burned, apparently after a prank went seriously awry . Bar staff also rushed to help with wet . towels at 1.30am on Sunday. But the victim was left with serious burns . to his chest, back and hands in the incident . He . was taken to James Paget Hospital in nearby Gorleston-on-Sea, and . later transferred to a specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in . Chelmsford, Essex. The . unnamed man was in a stable condition today with serious, but not . life-threatening burns. It is believed that the burns will leave him . scarred for life and potentially needing plastic surgery. Four . of the victim’s friends, aged 24, 26, 28, 33, were arrested and taken . into custody, but were later released on police bail pending further . inquiries. Norfolk Police . confirmed that all of the group came from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, . and were known to each other. It is believed that they were in Great . Yarmouth on a weekend away together. Britannia . Pier manager Keegan Snell, 40, said: ‘The whole incident was filmed on . our CCTV. It showed these guys throwing aftershave over each other. ‘One of them put a lighter to his friend’s back and he went up like a fireball. It looked like his whole body was on fire. The victim and the four arrested men are all from the Sheffield area and are believed to have been in Great Yarmouth for a weekend away . ‘His . friends and other members of the public put him to the floor quickly . and were trying to roll him to put out the fire.

His friends were in tears over what happened. ‘There . were four or five of us helping him to an ambulance. He could walk but I . don’t think he would have been able to on his own. ‘As . we were going down the pier, he had a T-shirt over his head and he was . crying and screaming. He was in a lot of pain and distress. The . ambulance got him away pretty quickly.’ Treatment: The man was taken to James Paget Hospital in Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk, and later transferred to a specialist burns unit at Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex (pictured) Mr . Snell said his staff later found the bottle of splash-on Brut on the . floor and handed it to police along with CCTV film of the prank. He . added: ‘There was no fight.

'Our thoughts are with the fella who got badly . burned and his friends who are distraught.

Before boarding a place to Cape Town on December 20 last night, Justine Sacco tweeted, 'Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!' - and promptly became public enemy no. 1. While she flew to South Africa from the U.S., she was unaware that the tasteless tweet . had been shared thousands of times and had even sparked memes and the hashtag . #HasJustineLandedYet. When she landed, she was promptly fired from her job at IAC, a media company that owns Match.com and Vimeo, and holed herself up in her family's home in South Africa. But . after admitting she was 'ashamed' for her attempt at a joke and . deleting all of her social media accounts, she has now reemerged and landed a new job. She . will help with the promotion and relaunch of the app Hot or Not, . which allows users to rate the appearance of other people who have . uploaded their pictures, Buzzfeed reported. This . time around, the app, which is owned by British company Badoo will use . location-based data to help you find the most attractive people nearby. Offensive: She tweeted this racist message before boarding a plane from the U.S. to Cape Town last year . Realization: Sacco was snapped as she left the airport last year and learned about the anger against her . The new job comes after she lived in Ethiopia for a month carrying out volunteer consulting for a non-government organization. After the debacle last year, she was pictured arriving in Cape Town airport looking shocked and talking on her phone - and moments later, her Twitter account vanished. She later apologized in a statement released to The Star, a South African newspaper. ‘Words cannot express how sorry I am, and how necessary it is for me to apologize to the people of South Africa, who I have offended due to a needless and careless tweet,' she said. ‘There is an AIDS crisis taking place in this country, that we read about in America, but do not live with or face on a continuous basis. Unfortunately, it is terribly easy to be cavalier about an epidemic that one has never witnessed firsthand.

The song is a celebration of his and . millions of other people's childhood memories and is a parody of the . Billy Joel song 'We didn't start the fire'. Graham . has changed the lyrics that now namecheck dozens of items relating to . the 80s such as PacMan, Roland Rat, TizWaz, Connect Four, video casettes . and the Walkman.

The video wistfully remembers long-forgotten features of the 1980s... including tasty Marathon bars before they turned into Snickers .

The video has struck a chord with its audience, who have reminisced about the age before mobile phones .

When she looks back at photos of herself dressed up in costumes and cutting birthday cakes, Jessica Masuglia admits she had a 'pretty happy' childhood. But under the surface it was a little more complicated. The 24-year-old from Melbourne was raised by her heroin-addicted mother.

ffb44b0ad86f0b59721a70c2d4be27eba1a4f2fa,"SARGODA, Pakistan (CNN) -- Mohammed Iqbal said he has been told by his landlord to pay up on debts and is left with a choice facing others in this impoverished corner of Pakistan: Sell your children or a kidney. This man's landlord forced him to pay off money he borrowed for his children's medical bills. For the 50-year-old Iqbal, there is only one option. Despite a law passed in late 2007 banning transplants for money, he has decided to sell his kidney and has already been for pre-operation tests. The sale will net him between $1,100 and $1,600. ""What's incredible here is the law that bans the operation he's going to go through came into place in 2007,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson. ""He's still able to go to a doctor, the doctors given him advice, that's what he has to do under law... He's going to make money out of it 100,000-150,000 rupees, and that is absolutely illegal. Yet, in just a few days, he's expecting to sell his kidney."" Iqbal was not alone in facing this difficult decision. Others in Pakistan's rural heartland have opted to sell their kidneys. One of them was Rab Nawas, who was deep in debt about a year ago to his landlord after borrowing money to pay for his wedding and to cover medical bills for his wife and six children. He, too, faced the choice: sell his children, his wife or a kidney.  See photos of Pakistan's impoverished kidney donors » . ""I am helpless. Should I sell my children? Should I go sell my children? So, it's better I sell my kidney. I had to return the money,"" said Nawas, who now bears a foot-long scar that wraps around from his back to his belly and is too weak to work the same hours he could before.  Watch Nawas show his operation scar » . People bearing the tell-tale scar of an organ removal in the villages around the farm where Nawas works are not hard to find. At one point, there were about 2,000 transplants a year -- with 1,500 of them going to what the government said were so-called ""transplant tourists."" The 2007 law was aimed at ending Pakistan's dubious status as one of the world's leading organ bazaars. Nawas sold his kidney after the law was passed and said the procedure was performed at the Rawalpindi Kidney Center in the northern city of Rawalpindi. When he went to the Rawalpindi center, after CNN asked him to show where the procedure was done, he said a doctor told him they did not have a record of his operation because they destroy such records when a patient leaves. The Rawalpindi clinic -- which prior to the law was a leading user of purchased kidneys -- told CNN that it abides by the law and does not get involved in deals between kidney donors and recipients. ""Standing there it's hard for me to fully understand the courage it took for him to make the journey. In this country, he has few rights, and even less security,"" said CNN's Robertson.","A law passed in late 2007 bans selling organs for money .

ffb4f5096f5797ba191ec090d77a3feb4d9d4e12,"(CNN) -- YouTube: It's not just for cute cats anymore. The Web's leading video site is now the home of a new kind of interactive visual journalism, where ""citizen witnesses"" are reaching millions of people with the news of the day, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center. A prime example was the tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011. In the week following the earthquake that caused the deadly wave, the 20 most-watched news videos on YouTube received 96 million views, according to the report. Most of that footage came not from professionals but from users who were in the middle of the disaster that killed more than 18,000 people. ""Citizens are creating their own videos about news and posting them,"" read the report released Monday. ""They are also actively sharing news videos produced by journalism professionals. And news organizations are taking advantage of citizen content and incorporating it into their journalism. ""Consumers, in turn, seem to be embracing the interplay in what they watch and share, creating a new kind of television news."" In effect, Pew describes an emerging partnership of sorts between traditional media outlets and citizen journalists. While many of the tsunami videos were user-generated, they received most of their views after being shared by professional outlets on the site, the report said. CNN has officially embraced citizen journalism since 2006 with CNN iReport, which encourages users around the world to share news, opinions, images and video on a wide range of topics. The second annual iReport Awards this month honored an iReporter's eyewitness footage of the 2011 Indiana State Fair stage collapse, among other video clips. The Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism studied 15 months' worth of news videos between January 2011 and March 2012, tracking the five most popular videos each week in the ""News & Politics"" channel on YouTube. ""The data reveal that a complex, symbiotic relationship has developed between citizens and news organizations on YouTube, a relationship that comes close to the continuous journalistic 'dialogue' many observers predicted would become the new journalism online,"" the report said. Among the study's findings: . • Video of natural disasters tends to draw the most attention. • News events outside the United States topped the list. The three most-viewed topics were the tsunami, Russian elections and unrest in the Middle East. As Pew notes, 70% of YouTube's traffic comes from outside the United States. • More than one-third (39%) of the top videos were clearly citizen-generated and another 51% -- making a whopping 90% of all videos studied -- came from news organizations but included some user-created content. • Personalities don't seem to be a big deal for YouTube news seekers. No individual appeared in more than 5% of the top news videos, with President Barack Obama topping the list by appearing in 4%. While the numbers are impressive, they still pale in comparison to the number of viewers of traditional television news. The report compares the 96 million-view week for tsunami videos to the roughly 22 million people who watch network news shows each evening. (That's 154 million over a seven-day period, and doesn't include cable or local news.) The difference, Pew notes, is that sites such as YouTube provide for ""a la carte"" news, letting users choose their own programming. The report does note one potentially troubling aspect of YouTube news sharing. Giving credit for videos, the report said, can get blurry, a problem stemming from a lack of clear ethical guidelines. Researchers found instances of traditional news sites apparently using citizen-created videos without clearly attributing them as well as citizens posting copyrighted material without permission. ""All this creates the potential for news to be manufactured, or even falsified, without giving audiences much ability to know who produced it or how to verify it,"" the report said.","Report: YouTube is becoming home to a new kind of visual journalism .

A Cincinnati man described as an 'enthusiastic participant' in child pornography involving an 11-month-old and a nine-year-old showed no remorse on Tuesday as he was sentenced to 240-years behind bars. James O. Napier, 40, was ordered to pay $95,009 to his victims after being found guilty of recording a video of himself molesting the infant in November of 2009 and placing it online after having babysat the child. Napier, who was found in possession of 1,300 child pornography pictures and 550 videos, also videoed himself making the nine-year-old girl perform oral sex on him, which he also placed on the Internet. The undercover investigation into Napier, 40, began when FBI officials in Phoenix found Napier was actively trading online child porn across the globe. Despite the horrific nature of his crimes, the judge was stunned by his total lack of remorse during his trial. U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott said this was factored into his sentence. 'He sat still, emotionless. He did not appear ashamed. He did not appear concerned . 'He appeared anything but remorseful,' court documents state. Furthermore, the court was unsure how to demonstrate that justice had been done. 'The United States is unsure whether any sentence would he 'just punishment' under the circumstances,' said court memos. Despite the severity of his crimes Napier showed no remorse during the trial, which factored into his sentence . Napier claimed to the court that he himself had been sexually abused in the past and told a probation officer he was molested between the ages of five and 10 by an older cousin. 'If true, the events of Napier's childhood sex abuse are tragic. However, these events do not grant Napier the right to subject at least two small children to repeated sexual abuse at his hands,' court documents state. Testimony given during his trial revealed that in November 2009, Napier molested the 11-month-old after become involved with her aunt. Police also testified that his pedophilic porn collection contained images and videos of children less than five-years old being raped and tortured for sexual pleasure. 'The initial investigation of Napier identified him as an active and enthusiastic participant in a community of morally depraved individuals who trade child sex abuse images and videos to satisfy their sexual desires,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Muncy told the court according to Cincinnati.com. 'One of his victims, due to her age, may never know the abuse she suffered. The other will never forget.' The court heard that he abused the nine-year-old girl while her family were in the house. 'While they slept peacefully, she was being sexually assaulted by Napier. While they played in another room, she was forced to perform oral sex on him,' said court documents. FBI agents arrested Napier on Jan. 18, 2013. He has been held without bond. Napier was convicted following a three-day trial in January on nine counts of production of child pornography. The jury also convicted Napier of one count each of transportation of child pornography, distribution of child pornography and receipt of child pornography.","James O.

ffb629854b296dc2f77565a168ff28068612b5ea,"By . Nick Pisa . Mafia boss Domenico Rancadore (pictured) targeted Father Gino Sacchetti because he encouraged residents to oppose the local mafia in Palermo . A brave anti Mafia priest has spoken of how he was targeted by an on-the-run Mob Godfather found hiding in a British suburb after 19 years. Former prison chaplin Father Gino Sacchetti was intimidated by members of the crime family run by Domenico Rancadore, 64, who was arrested in his flip flops at the home he shares with his wife and daughter. Fearless Fr Sacchetti, 75, stood up to the terrifying mobsters as they tried to shut him up in his campaign against the so called Costra Nostra 'men of honour' despite having a dead lamb nailed to his front door, his car firebombed and bullets sent to him in the post. A note sent with the bullets read: 'The first is for your heart, the second for your head, the third for the coup de grace. This is your final warning.' The softly spoken priest was based in the Mafia’s island heartland of Sicily for 20 years between 1986 and 2006 and spoke out against organised crime encouraging locals to turn their back on them and not be intimidated. Fr Sacchetti also angered mob bosses by refusing to sell up prime land which they wanted to use for a luxury development and were further outraged when he said he would instead open a shelter for drug addicts on the outskirts of Palermo - the heartland of Rancadore and his henchmen. Father-of-two Rancadore is said by Italian police to be the boss of the area around the suburbs of Caccamo and Trabia and their paths first crossed in the late 1980’s when the mobster was held in custody at the local prison where Fr Sacchetti was chaplain. Fr Sacchetti said: 'I knew Rancadore was involved in the threats against me - he sent two local brothers to threaten me. The brothers were arrested but Rancadore was already on the run. 'I suffered a series of threats and intimidation when I was a priest in Sicily. Fr Sacchetti was working as a prison chaplain in the cathedral city of Palermo in Sicily when his car was firebombed, had bullets posted to him and a dead lamb was nailed to his door . 'One period in particular was particularly bad - it was at the time I wanted to set up the shelter. 'My . car was firebombed and then I had the lamb nailed to my front door at . the church where I worked. Rancadore was said to be behind it. 'It was a horrific sight - something that is still clear in my memory, despite it being almost twenty years ago. 'There was a note pinned to it which read ""You will end up the same way"". It was a clear threat, they wanted to scare me but they were not going to put me off my work.' Fr Sacchetti, who now lives and works in Verona, was sent the bloodied lamb’s carcass at the same time as the late Pope John Paul II was visiting Sicily and had urged people to rebel against the Mafia. Mobsters had already murdered one campaigning priest Fr Giuseppe Puglisi, 56, who was gunned down by hit men in the run down Brancaccio area of Palermo in 1993 and the pope praised him for standing up to the gangsters. Fr Sacchetti said: 'Fr Puglisi was roughly the same age as me when he was murdered. Domenico Rancadore (pictured an artist's impression) was arrested in London after 19 years on the run . Mobsters had already murdered one campaigning priest Fr Giuseppe Puglisi, 56, who was gunned down by hit men in the run down Brancaccio area of Palermo in 1993 . 'The Mafia then turned its attention . on me because I would not back down to them. Rancadore back then was a . dangerous and powerful boss who controlled the area with fear. 'My . superiors in Palermo were very scared for my welfare but I said I would . not back down - as a result I was given a police escort around the . clock for ten years until I left Sicily in 2006. 'It was those officers with families looking after me who were brave. Years ago the Mafia had a rule that children, police and priests were untouchable but then back in the late 80’s and early 90’s things changed. 'The young son of an informer was dissolved in acid as punishment for him speaking out. Fr Puglisi was murdered and judges and police were targeted.' Fr Sacchetti added: 'Randacore was involved with very senior figures within the Mafia including Michele Greco who was in charge of Cosa Nostra at the time of the wars between rival clans. 'Rancadore used two brothers Salvatore . and Giovanni Colletti to threaten me with the lamb, the car bomb and . the bullets. They wanted me out but I was determined to stay and I did.' He added: 'I didn’t know . he had been arrested until you told me but I’m not surprised it has . taken so long to track him down. These people are very clever. 'Life on the run is horrible. You live in fear of being caught, looking over your shoulder all the time, dreading a knock on the door. It’s not a peaceful or serene life - it’s similar to the life I had under escort for ten years. 'One thing I will say though is that I have no anger or hatred towards Rancadore or the others that threatened me all those years ago. I have forgiven them and I bear no animosity towards them. 'My message would be to the young people, not to follow in the footsteps of their elders to a life of crime, they should not be afraid. The Devil has only one weapon, fear.

In one case a healthy middle-aged man was told he could not have a ten-minute operation to cut a small benign growth off the side of his  head, because of his habit. Paul Merrett thought it would be no problem to get the inch-long fatty lump, called a lipoma, removed. Patients in need of minor operations are being refused procedures by the NHS unless they promise to give up smoking (library image) It was getting caught when he put on ear defenders and hygienic headgear for his job inspecting catering equipment. As a result, the lump was becoming painful. But when he attended King George Surgery in Stevenage, his GP said  he could not have the minor operation – which doctors often do under local anaesthetic in their own consulting rooms. Should NHS patients have to promise to quit smoking before being treated by GPs? Should NHS patients have to promise to quit smoking before being treated by GPs? Now share your opinion . Mr Merrett, 46, said: ‘I was told, in no uncertain terms, that unless I gave up smoking or signed up to a quitting clinic they would refuse to treat me.  I was gobsmacked.’ He claims the doctor told him: ‘These directions are not mine. It’s not me refusing this treatment,  it’s the NHS trust.’ Mr Merrett, who smokes ten roll-ups a day, said: ‘It makes me livid. I can count how many times I have needed to rely on the NHS in the past ten years on one hand. I pay into the system and it’s my right to be able to use it when I need it.’ An increasing number of local health authorities are refusing smokers hip and knee replacements, unless they go on courses to quit smoking. Paul Merrett who was refused minor surgery to remove a growth, pictured, from his head because he is a smoker . And obese people are also being  told they must lose weight before costly joint replacement surgery, to increase the chances of success. In some areas, such as Devon and Cornwall, smokers can no longer get IVF on the NHS unless they stop. But this is the first time it has emerged that smokers are being turned down for minor treatments, where there is less evidence that smoking affects the outcome. Simon Clark, of the pro-smoking campaign group Forest, said smokers were being targeted to cut costs. He added: ‘Smokers pay a huge amount of money to the state through taxation – more than £10 billion a  year. That far outweighs the cost of treating smoking-related diseases, and even of treating cases such as this, which have nothing whatsoever to do with smoking. ‘The NHS should treat people equally, regardless of whether they smoke. If not, they run the risk of expensive court cases.’ Yesterday, East and North Hertfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group appeared to climb down over Mr Merrett’s case. Chief executive Lesley Watts claimed he had not been refused surgery. She said the risks of smoking and surgery would be explained to him ‘so informed consent can be obtained’ – but that he would still receive the procedure if it was safe to do so, even if he carried on smoking. But Mr Merrett said: ‘That wasn’t what the doctor said to me. They’ve back-pedalled big-time.’","Paul Merrett, 46, needed to have a growth from the side of his removed .

Father-to-be Tim June, 21, from Roswell, Georgia, died of asphyxiation caused by 'head and neck compression' on Saturday while working on a pine tree in Fairburn. Sergeant Anthony Bazydlo, a spokesman for the Fairburn Police Department, revealed that when officers turned up they were left confused at first by the cause of death. Father-to-be Tim June, of Roswell, Georgia, died after suffering 'head and neck compression' when he was struck by a tree branch. He is pictured (left) with his pregnant girlfriend Sarah Docekal . Police initially thought the force of the branch hitting Mr June had killed him. But pathologists later ruled he died of asphyxiation, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Following an emergency call, firefighters from the Fairburn Fire Department were dispatched to the scene and managed to remove Mr June's body from the tree and take him to a waiting ambulance. 'It took some doing to bring him down,' said Sgt Bazydlo. 'This is the definition of a tragic accident.' Mr June, who had worked as a tree trimmer for three years, was the owner of Atlanta Tree Assurance, founded last year. One of trees Mr June has trimmed, pictured on his company's Facebook page .

A new USCIS facility in Crystal City, Virginia is poised to immediately begin implementing Obama's plan, far in advance of a Republican congressional takeover that had the potential to stop him or slow him down through legislators' 'power of the purse.' 'USCIS is taking steps to open a new operational center in Crystal City, a neighborhood in Arlington, Virginia, to accommodate about 1,000 full-time, permanent federal and contract employees in a variety of positions and grade levels,' the bulletin reads. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE BULLETIN . NOT MESSING AROUND: The Obama administration took less than a day to launch a massive hiring push after the president announced his executive actions to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants into US society . 'The initial workload will include cases filed as a result of the executive actions on immigration announced on Nov. 20, 2014. Many job opportunities at the operational center will be announced in the coming days and please continue to monitor USAJOBS if you are interested.' The bulletin lists 32 examples of job openings, each of which was posted online on November 21. They include a chief of staff who will earn between $124,995 and $157,100 per year, and program analysts who will earn more than $138,000. Jobs earmarked for recent college graduates start in the range of $34,415 to $55,421. The White House did not respond to a question about how far in advance the decision was made to open the hiring floodgates. USCIS similarly did not respond to a request for comment about how long its plan had been in the works. Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions blasted the administration on Wednesday for the move. 'This facility is a clear symbol of the President’s defiance of the American people, their laws, and their Constitution,' Sessions said in a statement.' 'He is hiring federal employees to carry out a directive that violates the laws Congress has passed in order to foist on the nation laws Congress has repeatedly refused to pass.' Sessions warned, however, that a coming Republican majority in both the House and Senate could choke off the funds needed to pay 1,000 new salaries. 'The president cannot spend money unless the Congress approves it,' he cautioned, 'and certainly the Congress should not approve funds for an illegal amnesty.' NOT AMUSED: Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, warned that Congress could choke off the funds needed to pay 1,000 new salaries at USCIS . Sessions has emerged as one of the Senate's loudest critics of Obama's immigration policy shift, calling it a job-killer as he predicts a flood of newly-legalized illegal immigrants will rush to displace citizens from scarce jobs. 'This action will mean that American workers, their sons, their daughters, their parents, will now have to compete directly for jobs, wages, and benefits with millions of illegal immigrants,' he said Wednesday. Reached at his Senate Budget Committee office, Sessions communications chief Stephen Miller told MailOnline that 'every day this facility continues its lawless amnesty operations is another day an American loses his or her job, is another day an American doesn’t get the pay raise because lower-wage workers are available, is another day their tax bill is heavier because they’re funding illegal benefits for people who have no legal right to claim them.'

ffb78f241d3fad6ac08e50517134523ffb5efa55,"(CNN) -- Seth Meyers had big shoes to fill on Monday night. Meyers took over the ""Late Night"" chair from former ""Saturday Night Live"" alum Jimmy Fallon, who arguably had a great run as that show's host as he crafted now-pop culture favorites like ""Slow-jamming the News"" and ""The History of Rap."" So how did Meyers do with his debut? The reviews are in, and they range from ""meh"" to middling. The Daily Beast, which thought Meyers got ""off to a rocky start on 'Late Night,'"" noted that the newcomer ""had a few missions to accomplish when we ran into him on Monday night."" From 'Saturday Night' to 'Late Night' ""He had to prove that Fallon's reign isn't a fluke, that late night really can be a home for the affable and good-natured,"" the Daily Beast's Kevin Fallon wrote. ""And, most importantly, he had to show that the acute and observant brand of humor he displayed for 12 and a half years on 'Saturday Night Live,' many of those years spent as head writer and host of 'Weekend Update,' translates to the late-night talk show format."" Fallon (we are assuming no relation to Jimmy) said it was ""mission only sort of accomplished."" Jimmy Fallon's debut on ""The Tonight Show"" last week was as big as his personality. It featured a performance by the band U2 and plenty of laughs with guest Will Smith and some of Fallon's famous friends, including Stephen Colbert and Tina Fey. Meyers also got a little help from his friend Amy Poehler, who was one of his first guests along with Vice President Joe Biden. Poehler, and Meyer's former ""SNL"" castmate, Fred Armisen was also part of the show as the leader of ""Late Night's"" band. Meyers even paid homage to Fallon in the form of a letter he wrote to his predecessor, and which he read during the opening of the show. So many nods to his ""SNL"" past seemed to make sense to The Los Angeles Times, which observed that Meyers' ""monologue was reminiscent in style and cadence to his 'Weekend Update' segments, full of rapid-fire one-liners about the day's headlines."" ""Though he lacked the giddy enthusiasm that marked Fallon's first 'Tonight' outing last week, Meyers frequently acknowledged the show as a work in progress, noting that a monologue joke about UPS had bombed with the studio audience and making fun of his low-budget graphics,"" the L.A. Times' Meredith Blake wrote. Entertainment Weekly's Darren Franich gave the debut a grade of ""B."" ""I laughed at the premiere of 'Late Night with Seth Meyers' less than I laughed at 'The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon,'"" Franich wrote. ""But I laughed more at Seth Meyers than I did at Jimmy Fallon."" Music critic Ken Tucker was impressed, tweeting, ""Jeez, @sethmeyers @LateNightSeth makes eye contact, subtly refers to cards, responds to what guests say ... he's, like, an actual TALK show host!"" Others, too, seem willing to give Meyers some time to find his footing. Michael Starr of the New York Post wrote that Meyers ""eventually found his sea legs and drove his new 12:35 p.m. show to a solid, if unspectacular, debut. ... He's charming with a certain 'aw shucks' demeanor that doesn't seem forced or contrived, and he'll have plenty of time to grow into his new role as a late-night host,"" Starr said.","Seth Meyers took over from Jimmy Fallon on ""Late Night""

ffb7e5e4bf55e9fef97eb0b34b1c72fb87a2f61b,"Astronomical: One call to a 118 directory inquiries number had been charged at £5 a minute . Looking through my latest mobile phone bill, I almost had a cardiac arrest. It was three times the usual amount — all thanks to one item. A call I’d made to a 118 directory inquiries number had been charged at £5 a minute. And because I’d then got them to put me through, the total cost of the 26-minute call had come to £137.08, including VAT. Spluttering with shock, I contacted Vodafone, my mobile phone service provider, and asked how on earth they could justify this. A very apologetic lady explained that I had called ‘the wrong directory inquiries number’. Maybe I’m naive, but I hadn’t been aware that there could be a ‘wrong’ directory inquiries number. She explained that instead of calling Vodafone’s own service on 118 881, I had called the directory of Orange — another service provider — on 118 000. I explained that this was a totally innocent mistake. I had probably done so because I had dialled out of habit, having been an Orange customer some years ago until I switched to Vodafone. I’d been looking for the number of Sky TV customer services because my parents’ digibox had developed a fault on Christmas Eve. In any case, how is anyone supposed to accurately remember all these 118 inquiries numbers when they’re all so similar? Of course, with hindsight, I realised that I could have scribbled down the number, hung up, and then dialled it myself. That way I would have been charged at a standard call rate when talking to Sky. But when in a hurry or on the move, it can seem so much easier just to be put straight through. The woman at Vodafone sounded very sympathetic. She said she understood my distress but, unfortunately, Orange had charged Vodafone an inflated price and so Vodafone had to pass the cost on to me. If I had rung Vodafone directory inquiries on 118 881, it would have been 71p a minute. There didn’t seem to be any way of arguing with this. So I sighed, thanked her and resolved never to call a 118 number again, just in case I got the wrong one. But something was still nagging me, so the next day I decided to call Orange. They were adamant that the £5 a minute was nothing to do with them: they had not set the high charge for my call, Vodafone had. Orange’s charge for their directory service was £1.29 a minute, they said. In other words, the true cost of my call to Orange directory inquiries was nearer £34. So, with a bit of mental arithmetic, I worked out that when Vodafone charged me £137.08 for calling a rival firm’s directory, they had made a pure profit on that call of almost exactly £100. Yet Vodafone continued to insist the £5 a minute charge was not their fault. I asked them how much they had profited from my call. A spokeswoman said: ‘We pay the service provider (Orange directories) according to commercial agreements and we cannot share this information.’ Over the next few days, I went back and forth between Orange and Vodafone, repeatedly being told by both that the charges I had incurred were the fault of the other. By now it wasn’t the size of the astronomical bill that I was angry about, it was the childish, manipulative and downright disingenuous behaviour of the phone companies. While Vodafone appeared to be the culprit in this case, I started to suspect that they were all in this together, setting complicated pricing structures that were impossible for the consumer to interpret. When I looked at Vodafone’s website, there was a list of their charges for 118 numbers but there was no mention of what they charged for Orange’s 118 000. The biggest charge they admitted to was £2.71 a minute if a Vodafone customer rang BT’s 118 500. Complex: When Vodafone charged £137.08 for calling a rival firm’s directory, they had made a pure profit on that call of almost exactly £100. Yet Vodafone continued to insist the £5 a minute charge was not their fault . So I contacted Vodafone’s head office and said I was giving them one last chance to come clean about whether £5 a minute was their standard charge for a call by their customers to Orange directories. And, if it was, where was this charge published, as the industry regulations require? And at that point, the firm admitted: ‘We’re very sorry, but £5 a minute is our charge. We don’t know why you were told it wasn’t. It must have been human error.’ At last! It had taken me two weeks to establish who had really profited from my call to 118 000. A spokeswoman for Orange — when I eventually got hold of them — said: ‘It is the carrier’s decision on what rates they set. In this case, Vodafone has set the rate at £5 for a call to the Orange 118 000 directory inquiries for its customers. We can confirm that this is not the rate set by Orange.’ Vodafone charges . For Vodafone directories 118 881 . — 85p per minute . For Orange directories 118 000 . — £5 a minute . For ‘The Number’ 118 118 . — £3.25 a minute . For BT directories 118 500 . — £2.71 a minute .

For ‘The Number’ 118 118 . — £2.57 . For BT directories 118 500 . — £2.39 a minute . Only the most persistent person — one like me — would have bothered getting to the bottom of this scandal. But what chance does the average customer have of being able to navigate such a system? In fact, the 118 system is so complex and so complained-about that the regulator Ofcom is set to overhaul it. From July, phone companies will not be able to hide their 118 charges as easily, or levy complex rates where the true cost to the consumer is hidden. A big part of the problem is that there are two different elements to these calls: the cost that all the different directory inquiry companies, with their own call centres often in different countries, charge you for their services; and the cost your phone provider, like Vodafone, charges you to access them. At the moment, if you unwittingly dial the wrong number and use a directory service which isn’t your own phone provider’s, that second element — the ‘access charge’ — can be extortionate. And, as I found out, it is very difficult to find out how much it is. But, under the new rules, phone companies will have to publish prominently what you have to pay, and furthermore, the extra charge will have to be exactly the same for all the different directory inquiry services they allow you to access. The idea is that if customers know and understand what they are being charged, competition will drive the cost down. They will have to make it clear, for example: ‘Calls cost 1.20p per minute plus your phone company’s access charge.’ I’m still not convinced this is simple enough for customers to find out the total cost of the call as it will appear on their bill. After all, you would still need to contact your provider or check your contract to ascertain the access charge. But Ofcom insist it will be an improvement. If so, then it is about time. The 118 swindle is all the more disappointing for the customer because the proliferation of these phone firms was supposed to be a great liberation of the market and drive down prices. But as with the electricity and gas firms, deregulation has not brought the promised savings. In fact, if anything, it has allowed the phone companies to drive up prices. Indeed, it makes one long for the old days when there was just one BT number to dial for directory inquiries. When that old 192 number, costing a mere 40p a minute, was abolished in 2003 and the industry opened up to competition, 118 was made the new prefix for all the new services. Those who worked for Oftel (Ofcom’s predecessor as regulator), which brought in the change, would no doubt now claim this was a mistake rather than a conspiracy. Perhaps no one could have envisaged how phone companies would exploit the system. In practice, though, it has meant that customers have ended up so confused about which 118 number to dial without racking up enormous charges that, increasingly, they have had no choice but to avoid all of them.

But the extra-early ad blitz has infuriated shoppers who've taken to the retailer's Facebook page to slam the out-of-season commercial. Industry analysts say the unprecedented move will bring forward the Christmas ad cycle 'by a few weeks' as competitors jump on the promotional bandwagon. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . What the? Kmart has enraged customers by airing its first Christmas advertisement about its layaway program - featuring a gingerbread man - more than 100 days before the holiday . Market leader: Ad industry analysts say Kmart's decision to air a Christmas ad this week will move the Christmas ad cycle up 'by a few weeks' The . commercial, which first aired on September 8, promotes the retailer's layaway program. It features a . gingerbread man sneaking up on a woman working in an office cubicle, with a voice over saying: 'Don't let the holidays sneak up on you. Shop early with . Kmart free layaway.' Almost instantly, the retailer's Facebook page was brimming with complaints. One customer wrote: 'What happened to Halloween and thanksgiving? Stop with the Christmas commercials ALREAY! [sic]'. Another wrote: 'I WON'T be shopping at Kmart at Christmas. This is just a money making scheme. Kmart is only eager for the dollar signs. Places that start Christmas too early don't get my money. Christmas is NOT about gifts...it's about Jesus and family.' Unperturbed by the backlash, Kmart merely thanked its critics: 'We're just really excited for the holidays and layaway!' Last year, Kmart's first holiday ad aired on October 28, behind Target's infamous October 15 promotional launch. Secret Santa: A Kmart spokeswoman said the ad is being 'tweaked' but refused to comment on the retailer's holiday strategy . A Kmart . spokeswoman said the ad was being 'tweaked', but would not comment on the company's broader holiday strategy. 'Customers can plan in advance in order to take advantage of layaway for holiday purchases,' Kmart said in a statement to ABC News. Armed with National Retail Federation data showing 40 percent of holiday shoppers start buying before Halloween, several retailers have already announced their layaway schemes. On August 22, Walmart announced plans to launch free layaway from September 13 to December 13, officially kicking off the start to the holiday season, according to ABC News. Ace Metrix executive VP-marketing, Jonathan Symonds, . said it's important that . layaway ads are released early, but admitted it's 'eye . opening' that Kmart is out of the gate six to eight weeks earlier than normal. 'There might not be creative to respond with in the . pipeline,' Symonds told Ad Age. 'It will, by definition, create a slightly . earlier cycle. As opposed to right before Halloween, it will have the . impact of pulling the season up by a few weeks. But it won't start the . race today.' National Retail Federation spokeswoman Kathy . Grannis said Kmart's early blitz would boost competition in the sector. 'This . might give new meaning to the phrase Christmas Creep,' she said. 'It's anybody's game right now, wheels are definitely in motion for a . very promotional holiday season.'","Kmart aired its first Christmas advertisement on September 8 .

ffb96f0e468f16316b9c174a4bb9be7b288238fe,"(CNN)  -- The pilots of the commercial jetliner that last week overshot its destination by about 150 miles have said they were using their laptops and lost track of time and location, federal safety officials said Monday. The Airbus A320 was flying at 37,000 feet over the Denver, Colorado, area at 5:56 p.m. Wednesday when it last made radio contact, the safety board said. Northwest Flight 188 had departed San Diego en route to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport carrying 144 passengers, two pilots and three flight attendants. Northwest recently merged with Delta Air Lines. ""Using laptops or engaging in activity unrelated to the pilots' command of the aircraft during flight is strictly against the airline's flight deck policies and violations of that policy will result in termination,"" Delta said Monday in a statement. Pilot Timothy B. Cheney, 53, was hired in 1985 and has more than 20,000 hours flight time; First Officer Richard I. Cole, 54, was hired in 1997 and has about 11,000 hours of flight time, the report said. Neither pilot reported having had an accident, incident or violation, neither had any ongoing medical conditions and neither said he was tired, it said. They each had a 19-hour layover in San Diego; neither said he had slept or argued during the flight, but both said ""there was a distraction"" in the cockpit, according to the report. The pilots said there was ""a concentrated period of discussion where they did not monitor the airplane or calls"" from air traffic control, though both said they heard conversation on the radio, the report said. Neither pilot said he noticed messages sent by company dispatchers, it added. It said the men were talking about the new monthly crew flight scheduling system put into place in the wake of Northwest's merger with Delta Air Lines. ""Each pilot accessed and used his personal laptop computer while they discussed the airline crew flight scheduling procedure,"" the report said. ""The first officer, who was more familiar with the procedure, was providing instruction to the captain.""Neither pilot said he was aware of where the plane was until a flight attendant called the cockpit about five minutes before the plane was to have landed and asked their estimated time of arrival, the report said. ""The captain said, at that point, he looked at his primary flight display for an ETA and realized that they had passed"" the airport, it added. After 78 minutes of radio silence, the pilots re-established radio contact with air traffic controllers, it said. After landing at Minneapolis-St. Paul, both voluntarily underwent alcohol breath tests, which proved negative, the report said. The safety board said its investigators interviewed the pilots separately Sunday in Minnesota for more than five hours combined. The investigation will include scrutiny of the flight and voice data recorders, it said. An airline spokesman said Monday the company has sent the passengers on the plane $500 travel vouchers to compensate them for their inconvenience, and that the pilots have been suspended until the conclusion of the investigations. The NTSB on Monday interviewed the three flight attendants who were on the plane, a spokesman for the Association of Flight Attendants said. The lead flight attendant told officers she was unaware there had been an incident aboard, according to the report. Police who met the wayward jet said the pilots were ""cooperative, apologetic and appreciative."" The NTSB is hoping the plane's cockpit voice recorder either will confirm the pilot's account or provide evidence of another possible explanation, including whether the captain and first officer fell asleep. Watch the co-pilot speak . The voice recorder is capable of recording only 30 minutes of audio, federal accident investigators said. The plane was in the air for another 45 minutes after radio contact was restored, meaning that if the recorder was working properly, anything the pilots would have said during the time they weren't answering radio calls would have been recorded over. But a former accident investigator said the voice recorder may still provide valuable information, because the pilots could have discussed the earlier events on the way back to Minneapolis after overshooting the airport. The flight data recorder also could prove valuable because it would have recorded actions taken by the pilots during the 78 minutes they did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers, the ex-investigator said. Meanwhile, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which scrambled fighter jets for the wayward plane but did not launch them, said it was reviewing procedures for launching the fighters to track potentially hijacked or suspicious aircraft. At issue is the Federal Aviation Administration's apparent delay in notifying NORAD the Northwest jet was not in contact with controllers, according to a senior U.S. official directly familiar with the timeline of the incident. Watch how the military is looking at a possible FAA delay . The official, who declined to be identified because the military and the FAA are reviewing the incident, said the FAA's request for military involvement came after the plane passed the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. NORAD scrambled fighter jets at two locations. But as they approached the runway for takeoff, the FAA reported being back in contact with the Northwest flight, and the fighters stayed on the ground. ""My real question is why we did not know of the 'radio out' situation from the FAA sooner,"" the official said. ""The FAA is also looking into that."" Since the September 11, 2001, attacks, NORAD has regularly launched fighter jets to track aircraft in unusual situations such as when they deviate from flight plans, lose radio contact or enter restricted airspace. According to a second U.S. official, NORAD is in constant contact with the FAA so it can respond when situations arise. CNN's Mike M. Ahlers and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: Delta statement: ""Using laptops ... will result in termination""

Ten years of lies and betrayal came to a dramatic conclusion last night when Chris Huhne was finally put behind bars. The former Cabinet minister’s spectacular fall was complete when a prison guard led him in handcuffs to start an eight-month sentence. The prosecution said the 58-year-old millionaire had tried to cheat justice with a ‘scandalous’ legal defence. Vicky Pryce, who Huhne persuaded to take his speeding points and later divorced, was also given eight months for the same offence of perverting the course of justice. Last taste of freedom: Huhne leaves his London home and heads to court yesterday with his lover Carina Trimingham. He was given eight months in prison for perverting the course of justice . Describing her as ‘controlling, manipulative and devious’, Mr Justice Sweeney highlighted her revenge campaign that ruined her cheating husband’s career. He told the pair: ‘Any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault.’ Addressing Huhne, he said: ‘You have fallen from a great height albeit that that is only modest mitigation given that it is a height that you would never have achieved if you had not hidden your commission of such a serious offence in the first place.’ The former Liberal Democrat MP, who once harboured hopes of taking Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg’s job, had lied ‘again and again’ in what was a ‘flagrant offence’ of its type, he added.Huhne’s barrister said the catastrophe had torn his family apart. ‘He is a man laid bare,’ said John Kelsey-Fry QC. ‘He has two things left to which he can sensibly hope to cling. The support of his partner and loyal friends and the hope of a reconciliation with his children.’ The end: Former energy secretary Chris Huhne arrives at Southwark Crown Court yesterday to be sentenced for perverting the course of justice . He insisted however the politician was no bully and had not tried to impose his will on his family. Once a powerhouse couple – a senior politician and a leading economist – Huhne and Pryce looked more like strangers on a bus when in the dock yesterday. Their eyes failed to meet and they did not exchange a word. They sat 4ft from each other. The case was conducted at huge public expense and Huhne is estimated to have spent up to £500,000 on his defence. Yesterday it emerged that the Crown Prosecution Service is trying to recoup £117,558 in prosecution costs, £79,015 for Huhne and £38,544 for Pryce, plus an extra £31,000 from Huhne for a previous attempt to get the case thrown out. He is fighting the costs order. Mr Kelsey-Fry said Huhne will pay costs that are ‘just and reasonable’ but questioned the prosecutions version of how events unfolded. ‘Mr Huhne would not for a moment cave at paying just and reasonable costs attributed to him for this case,’ he said. ‘He would not want to be in any sense a burden on the public purse, bearing in mind his defence.’ Despite the dubious record of becoming the first former Cabinet minister since Jonathan Aitken to be jailed, Huhne has already launched a PR initiative apparently aimed at limiting damage to his image. In interviews hours before he was sentenced at London’s Southwark Crown Court he said he regretted not owning up earlier and accepted the judge’s conclusion that he ‘lied and lied again’. He agreed his political career was ‘very clearly over’.  In another interview, he maintained that jail was ‘a fairly small bit of the total penalty’ but admitted ‘lawmakers can be many things, but they cannot be lawbreakers’. Dubious honour: Huhne becomes the first former Cabinet minister since Jonathan Aitken to be jailed . Remarkably, he said he had hoped Pryce – described in court as fragile and a broken woman – would be acquitted instead of convicted at her jury trial. ‘I didn’t want her to go to jail,’ he said. ‘I told the kids and everybody else that. Revenge eats you up. It does worse things to you than to the person you are attempting to attack.’ The case came to a close just one day short of ten years from the moment a speed camera caught Huhne’s BMW doing 19mph above a 50mph limit on the M11 between London and Stansted. It might have begun with a simple motoring offence but it led to a desperately risky and ill-founded attempt to weasel out of a driving ban, compounded by lies, complex legal wrangling and an arrogant belief by both Huhne and Pryce that they would get away with it. They didn’t. Huhne comes into contact with a photographer's lens as he arrives at court. He tried to avoid a driving ban by falsely claiming his ex-wife was driving his car more than a decade ago . What Huhne might not have bargained for was the vengeful determination of a woman scorned – Pryce’s repeated attempts to expose her philandering husband by spilling details to the press of his criminal secret over the speeding fine. Nor, perhaps, did he imagine he would be ‘laid bare’ in a case that went ahead against his spurned wife for her part in the deception after he finally pleaded guilty, and she didn’t. Yesterday he made a public apology in court claiming he ‘felt awful’ about dragging people he loved into what he described as ‘this gruelling experience’. In legal mitigation it was clear that Huhne did not want to say anything derogatory about his ex-wife. Perhaps significantly, the sole allegation he did reject was a claim from her that he forced her to abort one of their children, part of the evidence she gave from the witness stand. Court artist sketch of Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce being sentenced at Southwark Crown Court in London yesterday . Both defendants wore black as they stepped separately into the dock. Pryce had a red rose in her bag from an admirer outside court, plus a double pack of tissues. Huhne read from papers given to him by his legal team. Their 26-year marriage ended more than two years ago after the exposure of his affair with Carina Trimingham, his 47-year-old PR adviser. The tall brunette sat a few feet from the dock alongside Huhne’s father Peter, visible to her lover but out of sight of Pryce. Sentencing the pair, Mr Justice Sweeney said: ‘To the extent that anything good has come out of this whole process, it is that now, finally, you have both been brought to justice for your joint offence. Rose for a prisoner: Vicky Pryce gets a rose from an elderly well-wisher on her way into court for sentence yesterday . ‘Any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault.’ The judge said Huhne had lied to avoid prosecution for the offence – then compounded those lies by insisting Pryce had not taken the points for him, pleading not guilty, and by trying to get the case thrown out under abuse of process. ‘Whereas the truth, as you well knew throughout, was that Vicky Pryce had taken the points for you and you were guilty,’ the judge said. Both Pryce and Huhne are expected to be released from prison after only two months with a tag and a strict curfew.","Decade-long saga ends as disgraced politician is jailed for eight months .

Michael Dunn, 47, is accused of murdering Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old, after he refused to turn down loud rap music he and his friends were playing in his car parked outside a store in Jacksonville, Florida. Rhonda Rouer, who was inside the store when the shooting happened, said she heard shots and was immediately told to get in the car by Dunn, who drove them back to their hotel. Prosecutor John Guy said Dunn (left)  fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' while the defense said it happened because he felt in imminent danger. Right: Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old from Marietta, Georgia . The couple then ordered a meal, made drinks and went to bed. Dunn was arrested the following morning. The shooting - which nobody denies led to Davis's death - happened after a shouting match between Dunn and the group of teenagers in the car. Dunn is accused of firing 10 times into the SUV, including several times as the driver tried to get away. One of the shots killed Davis. No one else in the SUV was injured. Earlier in the trial, prosecutor John Guy said Dunn fired at the SUV 'with malice in his heart and intent in his hand' while the defense said it happened because he felt in imminent danger. Michael Dunn, 47, (left) is on trial for a second time, charged with first-degree murder in the November 2012 killing of Jordan Davis, a 17-year-old from Marietta, Georgia . He has already been convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder and is facing 60 years in prison. Dunn is facing a retrial on the first-degree murder count after the jury deadlocked at the previous trial in February. Giving her testimony, Rouer said that she was buying chips and wine in the convenience store when she 'heard a pop, pop, pop'. She said she didn't know what was going on until she went outside and her fiancee Michael Dunn urged her to get into the car, then drove off quickly, before she could fasten her seatbelt. State Attorney Angela Corey shows witness Steven Smith a hat and asked him if he ever saw it above the roof line of the car that Jordan Davis was in during the shooting . Rouer repeated testimony she gave in the first trial, saying the couple, who live together, went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes, then she fell asleep. The next morning when she woke up, the TV was on and she said she saw that Davis had died and she told Dunn she wanted to go home. They drove straight back to Satellite Beach, canceling plans to have lunch with Dunn's son. Dunn was arrested after they returned home that afternoon. The prosecution spent a third day laying out its case that Dunn acted in cold blood when he killed Davis, who was sitting in the rear passenger seat of an SUV next to Dunn's car . Parents: Prosecutor John Guy, right, shakes hands with Jordan Davis's father Ron before the start of the Michael Dunn retrial . Dunn, who had just left his son's wedding, asked Davis and the other teens in the car to turn down the music and a shouting match erupted between Dunn and Davis. The trial was halted briefly Saturday when a juror was dismissed. The dismissal followed a column posted online by Jacksonville alternative publication Folio Weekly that quoted a one-time prospective juror who was not picked after he said he had written for the publication. Richard David Smith III told the publication that the juror who was picked had questioned State Attorney Angela Corey's competence during jury selection and complained about her sense of humor. Judge Russell Healey, Corey and other attorneys involved in the case questioned the columnist and Smith. One of four alternate jurors will replace the dismissed juror.","Michael Dunn 47, accused of murdering Jordan Davis, 17, in cold blood .

The 25-year-old R&B and hip-hop artist explains that therapy has been crucial in helping him better understand and grasp control of his feelings. ""I still talk to my therapist twice a week,"" he said. ""It helps me ... if I'm frustrated and I'm dealing with something, to vent and say what I'm going through so I can hear from an actual clinical person, 'This is how you should react,' or 'It's good to feel this way because feelings, emotions, and energy and emotions, are supposed to come and go. It's not supposed to stay there, you're not supposed to keep it inside, because it'll just bottle up and you'll become a monster.'"" The singer noted that due to his past, he's not in a position to pass judgment, but is simply speaking from his personal experience. ""For anybody who's going through that situation or anybody who's dealing with it -- it's all about the choices,"" Brown said.

The . avid stamp collector has also made up a special 2012 Olympic tribute to . a local sports club also made entirely out of stamps. Each picture . takes John around 30 hours to complete and needs about 1,500 stamps - . around £700 worth if bought new. First-class: Jack Bottomley works on his Marilyn Monroe portrait. Some of his works can take more than 30 hours to make . Father-of-one John, from Clayton, . Manchester, who cares full time for his wife said: 'I must have a million . stamps, I’ve got albums full and as I love artwork it just seemed to . make sense to use old stamps to create pictures. 'But . when I get orders for my work I do wonder whether I should cheekily ask . the Royal Mail for free postage - because of all the stamps I use. 'I’ve not made any money from it, it’s just cost me a lot of time and my own money, but it is a love. 'I . was collecting stamps back with my brother back in the 60s; the first . was probably just a normal postage stamp, I would have cut it off and . started to collect them. 'The first one I did was Elvis, it was a challenge straight through, I think it took me about thirty hours. 'So . far I’ve done Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jackson and I’ve just started . Liza Minnelli and whatever else comes along. I’ve got an order from a . friend for an Elvis one. Return to sender: John has also made a portrait of Elvis Presley. Sometimes John uses as many as 1,500 stamps in each piece . 'I’ve . done one for the 2012 Olympics, I’ve not seen anything in stamps about . like that before, and it’s quite unusual. It’s not easy because it can . take so long and I hate wasting stamps. You do also end up with lots of . glue on your hands.' John says he was first inspired to . collect when he saw a little dish his uncle made completely out of . stamps and couldn’t get over how unusual it was. And from there his collection grew and grew with him even purchasing three bin liners full of postage stamps for £300. But after years of making plates, cards and gifts for friends and family he decided to branch out to re-creating images. He . added: 'I’ve collected stamps on and off over many years. I first got . the idea in my aunt’s house when I saw a plate on her wall, made by my . now late uncle and he’d done it out of stamps. What a dish: John with one of the plate collages he has created, commemorating the London 2012 Olympics . 'It . was four or five different colours and I’d never seen anything like it . before. I used to do plates and then I thought there must be a way of . using the stamps in pictures. 'But when you pixilate an image the pixels are square and stamps are oblong, so it’s not easy and then you have all the colours and shading as well. 'The Elvis one must have taken me over thirty hours alone. I’ve got to get my stamps first of all cutting them off or steaming them off and drying them and then sorting them into colours and getting them ready to start. 'The problem is its very hard to get someone to be able to pixilate a picture, there’s only one person I’ve found who can do it properly. 'But I’ve also done birthday cards, Christmas cards all made out of postage stamps they’re much better than the ones you can buy over the internet.

Alastair Godfrey, 19, . the son of the family friend, offered to drive the twins and another . schoolfriend, Hannah Jenkins, back to school on the Sunday evening of . April 30. Christopher and . Andrew piled into the back of Alastair’s Renault Clio.  Hannah sat in . the front. Andrew put on his seatbelt, Christopher did not.  ‘Alastair . drove along the narrow country roads and into the school grounds,’ Andrew recalls, ‘but we went over a hill too quickly and smashed into a . 4x4 driven by one of the school’s groundkeepers. Identical twins Andrew (left) and Chris (right) Watson at the age of four . ‘I remember spinning around in the car and was then unconscious for a few minutes. ‘When I came around, I decided to get help from school and as I wandered down the road, I saw Chris lying curled up about 15 yards from the car. He was breathing but it was very shallow. ‘I was in such a state of shock, I initially couldn’t work out why he was there. It was only later I heard he had been thrown out of the car. ‘He and Alastair, who tragically died that night, were quickly taken away by ambulance. ‘Another ambulance took Hannah – who fortunately wasn’t too badly hurt – and me to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. 'I had some internal bruising. Chris was taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. After a week, Mum told me that he wasn’t in good shape so I went to see him.’ Andrew pauses and looks down at his hands in his lap. ‘I couldn’t stay with him for more than five minutes on that first occasion. ‘I don’t think anyone can understand what it is like seeing your identical twin like that because it looks as if it is you. ‘He had two massive black eyes, his head was shaved and there were tubes attached to him everywhere. It could so easily have been me, if I hadn’t put my seatbelt on, and I felt knocked off my feet for a long time. I sat and cried in the hospital waiting room. ‘It was also so heartbreaking to realise that something like this could happen in a blink of an eye. ‘One minute we were having a laugh on the way back to school and the next... ‘I gradually got more used to seeing him and on regular occasions while he was in an induced coma, I would hold his hand and talk to him and the nurses would tell me his blood pressure went down and he seemed more relaxed. That helped relax me. ‘I stayed at boarding school, but thought about him all the time. Because of our telepathic connection, when I couldn’t sleep or felt very agitated, I knew something was wrong. 'I would then phone Mum to ask about him and it usually turned out that he had had an epileptic fit. It was the weirdest experience. Andrew (left) and Chris (right) pictured with their sister Emma in 2005, one year before the accident . 'Chris still had some brain activity initially and would respond to simple commands, but sometimes when I thought I’d seen something, the nurses said they hadn’t.’ Shortly afterwards, Christopher was operated on for a ruptured stomach and from then on tests recorded zero brain activity. As well as developing epilepsy, Christopher had several strokes. His immune system shut down and he suffered from meningitis, MRSA and chest and urinary infections. In 2008, Andrew, his mother and sister met doctors and they mentioned that withdrawing feeding was an option. Andrew felt positive about the idea. ‘It was heart-wrenching to watch Chris’s physical deterioration. He had no dignity and could not communicate, which is no way for anybody to live,’ says Andrew. Christopher (left) and Andrew (right) with their sister Emma . ‘Mum signed a “Do not resuscitate” order and we took the decision as a family to withdraw feeding and let nature take its course. I had to force myself not to focus on the emotional side, as I didn’t want Chris to feel any of that when I went to see him. ‘I believed strongly that as Chris couldn’t make the decision for himself, I had to think for him. When you see someone who could do everything become completely helpless, you know it is no way to live.’ The court agreed in November 2010 that feeding could be withdrawn but the family then ran into another problem. ‘The lady who ran the care home in Leicester where Chris spent three years said she didn’t think it was the right thing to do and wouldn’t allow it to happen there. So we had to find a hospice to move him to. ‘At the hospice, he survived for ten days and died early on December 7. Mum went into his room first and I caught a glimpse of him through the door. It made me feel I had been hit by a giant stone. ‘But I told myself I had to go in. I said a final goodbye and a final  “I love you” then left in disbelief – because I had lost the most important person in my life.’","Twins Andrew and Christopher Watson were in the same car accident .

ffbc93f4d010a538ee3fb0e22b0404353ef2a277,"(CNN) -- It was around 6:30 in the morning. The air was crisp, the farmers had just watered their fields -- corn perhaps, Omar doesn't entirely recall -- and the ground was muddy, slippery and uneven. There was a pack on his back, a bag slung over each shoulder, and cradled in his arms, the frail body of his 11-year-old brother Abdulrahman. Abdulrahman, the baby of the family, couldn't walk on his own. His left leg was blown off in late July. Read more: Cave becomes classroom for Syrian kids . The last words of the driver who dropped them off echoed in Omar's mind: ""You're on your own now."" It was as far as the car could safely take them in Syria, a few hundred meters from the Turkish border. Omar's back ached, his arms in agony. He focused on putting down one foot after the other, struggling to keep his balance. He looked down at Abdulrahman's face every few minutes and tried to smile reassuringly. Read more: Who is arming the Syrian conflict? ""The only thing that I could think was to arrive, that whatever I was going through, once I arrived it was all going to be OK,"" Omar said. For the safety of the brothers and their family back in Syria we are omitting their last name, specific locations, and other identifying details. ""There were fighter planes and there was a rocket that hit close to our house,"" Abdulrahman says quietly about the day he was injured. ""I went to see what was going on and another rocket hit."" He doesn't say much beyond that; at times simply nodding or smiling sweetly, or seemingly lost in his memories. Tears slowly overflow out of Omar's eyes. He slowly wipes them away as he looks down at Abdulrahman. Read more: Why region fears al-Assad's 'blackmail' in Beirut . Omar, 21, was sleeping when the first rocket hit. His mother, panicking, came running into his room. ""My mom woke me up saying, 'Stand up immediately.' She said Abdulrahman went out and the plane is roaming, is circulating above, you need to get him back to the house,"" Omar tells us. He was too late. ""I kept running, the first guy saw Abdulrahman injured and he said 'Catch up to your brother, he's about to die.' I can't control, I ran, ran, ran. When I got there, they told me the ambulance has just taken him."" Read more: Exiled Syrian writer honored for 'Diaries' of revolt . Abdulrahman doesn't speak to us about those moments. But Omar says his brother recounted how people were running away. ""He was wounded, and he began shouting, 'Isn't there anyone to carry me?'"" Omar found his brother in the makeshift field clinic, in the basement of the town's mosque. ""Once he saw me, he shouted 'Omar!' -- shouted with all his strength. I didn't see what happened, I just saw blood. When I got closer I saw his leg and I just yelled and I started crying."" Abdulrahman's leg was amputated; there was no way to save it. It was practically entirely severed just below the knee. ""After he woke up I was crying, I couldn't control myself, and he said, 'If you love me don't cry,'"" Omar recalls, eyes slightly widening, acknowledging our amazement at his brother's strength. He says Abdulrahman made him promise not to cry in front of their mother. ""I said I will control myself,"" Omar continues. ""I told him, do you know where your leg is? He said, 'I know it's cut, I keep feeling it, it hurts.' I told him it just went before you to heaven."" Read more: Defecting Syrian propagandist says his job was 'to fabricate' And that is also when Omar made another promise to his younger brother: that he would walk again. Omar started working to save money for a prosthetic, but quickly realized that it would take too long to raise the funds. He began asking around, went online. A group of Egyptian doctors happened to be visiting the field clinic, and they told him about the Global Medical Relief Fund, a small U.S. nongovernmental organization that is dedicated to helping children badly wounded in disasters and war zones. GMRF takes care of children's follow-up prosthetics and physical therapy until they reach the age of 21. The founder, Elissa Montanti, quickly responded: Yes, of course, she would take on his case, but first the brothers had to get to Turkey. They did make it safely across the border. And after a long and arduous journey navigating a country they don't know, a language they don't speak and with meager funds, they made it to Ankara, the Turkish capital, where they are now waiting. Montanti has been working on the brothers' paperwork to get Abdulrahman to the U.S. for medical treatment, made all the more challenging because they don't have passports. Their visa requests were denied. Now they are waiting to see if the State Department will grant them humanitarian parole. Omar pulls his brother in closer, gently stroking his cheek. The two, always close, are now inseparable. But Abdulrahman, despite his frequent shy smiles, is constantly plagued by the memories. ""He has nightmares and sometimes daydreams, bad daydreams,"" Omar tells us. ""He says 'I feel it, I feel just like there is a snake around.' I keep telling him it doesn't exist and he says it hurts and starts screaming."" Abdulrahman, under his breath, says he sees a big one, surrounded by smaller ones. Omar says his mind is always churning, obsessed with make sure his brother is, quite simply, OK. ""All the time I think how to make him comfortable. It's just like raising a child -- I have to take all the responsibilities. He needs to be educated again. I want to take advantage of this situation to teach him languages, everything I can."" Tragically, Abdulrahman has already learned one of the harshest lessons of all. ""The most important thing that he's learning at this time,"" Omar says, ""it's to be aware, to grow up his mind. He's not a child anymore.""","11-year-old Abdulrahman lost his leg during a rocket attack is Syria .

ffbd5e9659edc9dd71f23da87243ff97bf7c43db,"(CNN) -- Zainab Alhusni was a simple seamstress in Syria, well-loved by all her neighbors and friends. Now, in a tragic turn of events, she has become a symbol of the cruelty gripping that conflict-wracked nation. Alhusni was only 18 when she stepped away from her Homs residence last month to buy groceries. Her family never again saw her alive. She was whisked away by Syrian security forces to coax the surrender of her activist brother, and ended up beheaded and dismembered, a neighbor, activists and human rights groups say. Waleed Fares, a neighbor and family friend, told CNN on Monday that Zainab's father died when she was just a toddler, leaving her mother and three siblings to fend for themselves in a country with often-unfavorable conditions for a single mother. All four children dropped out of school at a young age so they could work as laborers to provide for their family, Fares said. Zainab dreamed of owning her own tailor shop, so she could support her impoverished family, he said. But she never had a chance to fulfill that dream. Her older brother, Mohammed, became a well-known activist in the family's hometown of Homs in western Syria, often leading the demonstrations against embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and treating the wounded. ""Protesters would carry Mohammed on their shoulders so he could lead the chants,"" Fares said. ""He was very loved by everyone. The protesters even had a chant they would say for him, using his nickname: 'Abu Ahmed, may Allah protect you!'"" Security forces pursued Mohammed Alhusni for months, raiding his family's home several times, causing the family to flee to a nearby neighborhood on July 25, Fares said. On July 27, Zainab Alhusni disappeared, leaving her family devastated and her siblings panicked and anxious, the neighbor said. ""If it had been her brother it would have been different. Taking Zainab, it became a matter of family honor and family pride. Her mother was beyond depressed. She seemed to be between life and death,"" Fares said. Neighbors and family friends called on each other to collect donations to ease the family's financial troubles, but this became the least of the Alhusni family's concerns. Several days after Zainab disappeared, security forces called the family and offered to meet them in a pro-Assad neighborhood where they would trade Zainab for her activist brother. ""The family did not trust the security forces. They would not even confirm to them that Zainab was alive, and they all believed it was a trap to take Mohammed, too,"" Fares said. On September 10, the family says, Mohammed was wounded in a demonstration. He came back to his loved ones a corpse. The family believes he was tortured to death. In a statement posted to YouTube, another brother, Yousif Alhusni, describes multiple gunshot wounds to Mohammed's chest and a single shot through his mouth. ""His arms were broken and there were cigarette burns to his face,"" he adds. The family went to collect Mohammed's body from a hospital when doctors told them another unclaimed body with the label ""Zainab Alhusni"" had been kept in the morgue's freezer for some time. When the family received the body, her head and arms had been chopped off. Chunks of her flesh were charred, appearing in places to have been melted or burned down to the bone. Authorities forced Zainab's mother to sign a document saying both her daughter and her son had been kidnapped and killed by an armed gang, Amnesty International said in an online statement . ""If it is confirmed that Zainab was in custody when she died, this would be one of the most disturbing cases of a death in detention we have seen so far,"" said Philip Luther, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East and North Africa. The case also drew the antipathy of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which characterized the incident as ""appalling"" and an example of the ""targeting and attacking of families and sympathizers of the protesters by security forces."" The ferocious Syrian government crackdown against dissenters began in mid-March when anti-government protests unfolded. The number of people killed over the past six months has reached at least 2,700, according to the U.N. human rights office. Some activist groups put the toll at around 3,000. Syrian authorities could not be reached for comment on the Alhusni case. The Syrian government has maintained armed gangs with foreign agendas, not the regime, are responsible for the violence that has plagued the Arab country for months. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video, the claims, or the death toll because the government has repeatedly denied requests for journalists to report inside Syria. ""Perhaps more than any other family they were chosen to be at the front lines of the Syrian revolution,"" Fares said of the Alhusni family. ""They were very poor, so they felt the brunt of the injustice more than any other family. For Mohammed at least, he felt he had nothing to lose."" The neighborhood where the family lived, Bab Alsibaa, held a rally for Zainab on Sunday, and people vowed the brutality that destroyed the Alhusni family could only strengthen their resolve. ""The case of Zainab Alhusni is not just for our town, or province, or even for the country of Syria. It is a human rights issue that should bring the attention of the world,"" Fares said. But despite Fares' insistence that ""after Zainab our chants are louder, our numbers greater,"" he admitted the people of Bab Alsibaa constantly worry about their female family members. ""Even stepping outside the home is a risk for women now,"" he said. CNN's Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","Syrian girl Zainab Alhusni dreamed of owning her own tailor shop, a neighbor says .

ffbdc9a16007508d73f3742c02230c77ad78f29a,"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 04:58 EST, 18 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:02 EST, 18 November 2013 . Thousands of workers blacklisted by construction firms are to receive up to £100,000 each in compensation, it emerged today. More than 3,200 names, mainly of building workers, were kept on the list, drawn up by a shadowy organisation called The Consulting Association. Workers launched legal action after finding they were denied work, often after raising concerns about health and safety on building sites. Thousands of construction workers were blacklisted by companies after raising concerns about safety (file picture) Last month eight firms announced that they are working together to develop a scheme to compensate construction workers whose names were on database. Now it has emerged that initial offers range from £1,000 to as much as £100,000 per worker, according to the Financial Times. The revelation comes amid a coalition row over plans to investigate separate reports of union intimidation linked to the Grangemouth oil refinery dispute in Falkirk. The Tories said the QC-led inquiry would focus on the Unite’s tactic of sending mobs of demonstrators to protest outside the homes of company directors. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted it would look at all rogue practices, by unions and employers alike. The Lib Dem leader said: ‘This is a short independent inquiry looking at irresponsible behaviour of both trade unions and businesses. ‘I'm a huge supporter of the way in which responsible trade unions and responsible businesses have actually maintained strikingly good... industrial relations during the recent years. But there are some irresponsible trade unions... and there are some irresponsible business practices, unacceptable ones such as blacklisting. ‘And this inquiry, run independently of government, will look at it in the round.’ Eight firms have set up a compensation fund to recompense more than 3,200 people who were unable to get work . News of the first offers to workers who were blacklisted comes ahead of a TUC day of action on Wednesday against the practice. The Consulting Association was closed down following a raid on its West Midlands offices by the Information Commissioner’s Office. But unions said workers continued to be discriminated against if their names were on the list. A total of 44 firms were found to be using the blacklist. The names of a number of environmental activists were also included. The Construction Workers Compensation Scheme was launched by eight companies: Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O’Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and VINCI PLC. In a statement last month they said: ‘The companies all apologise for their involvement with TCA and the impact that its database may have had on any individual construction worker. 'The companies have joined together to establish the Construction Workers Compensation Scheme. 'The scheme is intended to make it as simple as possible for any worker with a legitimate claim to access compensation. 'The companies have invited workers’ representatives to enter into a period of engagement to ensure that the proposed terms of the scheme are fair and effective. The group is also engaging with other interested parties.’","More than 3,200 names, mainly of .

ffbdcee752ad0fc643a45ac8eefbd8f1af2b9050,"A graphic designer accused of poisoning her mother in a Breaking Bad-inspired murder plot fantasised about being Walter White or a 'Mexican drug warlord', a court has heard. Kuntal Patel allegedly became 'obsessed' with killing her mother Meena and bought deadly poison online after the 60-year-old 'forbade' her from marrying the man she loved. The 37-year-old, from Stratford, east London, contacted a dealer in the U.S through the 'dark web' and said she needed a 'tasteless' and deadly toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'. 'Plot': Kuntal Patel, 37, (left), from east London, is accused of trying to kill her mother Meena Patel, 60, (right) by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly poison in a Breaking Bad-style plot . But, today, Breaking Bad-obsessed Patel told jurors it was all part of her 'fantasy' in which she imagined herself as a character in the American TV series. The series ends with teacher-turned-drug producer Walter White spiking a rival's drink with deadly ricin. Patel told Southwark Crown Court: 'It was like I saw myself to be some kind of Mexican drug warlord. I would think it through as if I was the main character in Breaking Bad. 'It was all a big mess. A complete and utter mess. 'I think in my mind, because I was living in my fantasy world, in my TV episode that I had created in my mind, I was just trying to find out what it would be like.' Patel, who worked for Barclays in Canary Wharf, is accused of trying to kill her mother by lacing her Diet Coke with a deadly toxin after the breakdown of her engagement to Niraj Kakad. During the second day of her evidence, the court heard how Patel had emailed the dealer after receiving the drug saying something had 'gone wrong' - because the 'target' was still alive. She wrote: 'Something has definitely gone wrong somewhere as it is now early Saturday morning and still everything is normal. 'Yes, target drank all of it. I made sure I watched her drink it all. I had to borrow money from friends to get this stuff from you because it's my last option. 'I can't be with the man I love because my mother doesn't like him. She is a bitter, miserable old woman and has been physically mean to me and my sister.' But speaking to the jury, Patel insisted the email was a 'fabrication'. Accused: Jurors at Southwark Crown Court heard how Patel (pictured in a court sketch) fantasised about being Walter White, the main character in Breaking Bad, or a Mexican warlord . She told the court how she initially ordered a batch of the deadly poison for £950 but 'panicked' and threw it away. But a few weeks later, the situation at home became too much for Patel to handle and she started having thoughts about killing herself and her mother again, she told jurors. The court had previously heard how her mother started beating her 'on and off' when she grew bitter about her daughter's new relationship with Niraj Kakad, whom she met online. Patel explained that she wanted more poison but did not want to pay for it. So she fabricated the story about feeding her mother the poison  so she could get another batch from the dealer for free, jurors heard. If he had known it was thrown away, the deal would have charged her another £950, she said. The prosecutor later labelled her version of events as 'one last roll of the dice' in an attempt to cover her tracks. She told jurors: 'I told him, I pretended that I had used it and I had watched my mother drink it. And I thought that by doing that it would pressurise him into sending another package. But she said emails sent to her dealer claiming she had poisoned her mother were a 'fabrication' 'I know how it appears, but the truth is I didn't do anything, it's all fabrication. 'It escalated and I had to go to work and pretend like everything was OK and I had to be at home and pretend everything was OK. 'But I was living this other life. This was my own way of coping - it was my coping mechanism. It was how I survived daily.' Wiping away tears from her eyes, she told the jury: 'I didn't do it, I didn't put anything in my mother's coke.' The court previously heard how Patel got poison sent to her hidden in a candle. It is alleged she slipped it to her mother's drink in December last year. But Patel claims she freaked out when she saw the candle and threw it away. Prosecutor Mr Polnay told the court that Patel was a 'liar' and not a fantasist and wanted her mother 'dead by Christmas'. He suggested she was buying the poison because she 'wanted it for murder'. But Patel replied: 'That's not true.' Mr Polnay continued: 'The truth is, to be with the man you loved you couldn't see any other way but to knock off your mum.' He added: 'I suggest this Breaking Bad fantasy is one last desperate roll of the dice. The last story after all the other lies had been uncovered.' But Patel insisted she was not lying in court, saying: 'The truth is, I could never hurt myself or my mother.' The former London Olympics volunteer said that when counter terrorism police raided her home in January she thought Jehovah's Witnesses were at her door. She was arrested and spent four days being questioned by officers at a police station. She told the court: 'I was told to quickly grab some clothing and leave the house. That was the last time I saw my mum and my sister. 'It was like a really bad dream. It just wasn't the real me. It was like me coming back to my senses and reality. 'It was a huge reality check, it was me coming back into the real world, real life, having to account for my actions.' In court, Patel admitted telling police 'a pack of lies' lying to police because she was terrified they would discover her email exchanges with the dealer. She said: 'I know I lied, I told many lies. The reason I lied was because I was frightened and scared. 'I didn't want the police to know what I had done in relation to the searches. I was terrified about what I had done in relation to the searches.' Peter Rowlands, defending, told jurors that, during a phonecall from Holloway Prison, Patel told her mother: 'I was going to kill you and Ambama saw that, that's why she is punishing me.' In the call, Patel added: 'I have done everything bad and dirty and goddess Ambama has seen what this girl is doing to her mum and so she has sent me here.' The Hindu goddess Ambama is said to punish bad acts. But Patel said she did not mean her 'confession' literally. She said: 'I meant that Ambama the goddess saw that I had these kind of thoughts against my mother. Not that I literally had done anything, which I had not.' Jurors heard how at work and at home Ms Patel was living one life, but in her mind was living a second 'secret life'. Role: Meena Patel is a  magistrate at Thames Magistrates' Court in Bow, east London . She claimed that like every other girl she wanted her mother at her wedding, and could never kill herself or her mother. She also confessed to hating the magistrate for scuppering her chances of love. Jurors have been read a series of messages exchanged between Patel and two of her friends, Julie Wong and Darcia Babb, in which Patel expressed her desire for her mother's death. In one she wrote: 'I am stuck with that miserable f*** until she dies.' She admitted to the court that she felt her mother was responsible in part for a 'roadblock' ruining her one shot chance of getting married, having a family, moving out of Stratford and 'living happily ever after'. Jurors heard Patel also allegedly looked on Google for how to find a hit man in Mumbai. Her mother had travelled to the Indian city for a court case. The court previously heard how she combed poison websites and Googled 'How to murder someone and get away with it' after being 'obsessed' with thoughts about killing her mother and taking her own life. Patel told jurors she would watch stay up all night watching and taking notes on Breaking Bad, later planning to buy a poison. She also became fixated with taking her own life and spent hours scouring suicide websites, the court was told. Ms Patel admits two counts of attempting to acquire a biological agent or toxin, but denies attempted murder and a further charge of acquiring a biological agent or toxin. The trial continues.

ffbde53920df8cc87a4b3dd9a101c77d778fa32e,"(EW.com) -- ""Savages"" is Oliver Stone doing what he should have done a long time ago: making a tricky, amoral, down-and-dirty crime thriller that's blessedly free of any social, topical or political relevance. How liberated from an agenda is this movie? It's about two marijuana dealers in Laguna Beach who run afoul of a Mexican drug cartel, and the film has nothing at all to say about either undocumented immigrants or the war on drugs. Yet you can feel how alive Stone is to the material. He stamps every scene with his darkly combustible cinematic personality. Based on a novel by Don Winslow, ""Savages"" is grandiose underworld pulp staged with screw-tightening skill and a taste for nasty kicks that spills over into sadism and dread. It's like a jacked-up ""Miami Vice"" told from the point of view of the criminals. The film is narrated, in a ""Sunset Boulevard""-meets-""Kill Bill"" way, by Ophelia (Blake Lively), known as O, a free-spirited California blonde who lives with, and loves, two guys and is their anything-goes siren-goddess. Chon (Taylor Kitsch), a scarred, sexy hunk of an Afghanistan war vet, is the tougher and more volatile of the men. His friend and business partner, the gentler Ben (Aaron Johnson), is a wispy-bearded nihilist hippie. The two went into the drug game together with a crop of ''primo'' marijuana seeds that Chon smuggled back from Afghanistan after enlisting in the military for that purpose. They've harvested those seeds into a greenhouse crop that yields weed with THC levels of 33% (the best high anyone's ever had). But the popularity of their product threatens the cartel's business, which is why the gangsters come calling like a vicious corporation that talks ''partnership'' when it means ''hostile takeover.'' Run by a ruthless matriarch (Salma Hayek) from her hacienda, the cartel issues a warning in the form of a creepy Internet video of a dungeon full of freshly decapitated victims. But Chon and Ben are too arrogant to know what they're dealing with. So the gangsters kidnap O and place her in the dungeon, where they threaten to hack off her fingers. ""Savages"" is violent enough to risk turning off a portion of the audience. Yet even as the movie descends into blood-spattered exploitation, it's revving up the suspense. When characters are threatened with stuff this brutal, you'd better believe there's something at stake. To get O back, Chon and Ben must become masterminds and warriors. They have to descend into savagery themselves. Stone presents some bravura set pieces, from a pulse-quickening encounter with a highway cop to an incendiary multivehicle heist to every scene with Benicio Del Toro as a very scary sociopath. As for Taylor Kitsch, he wipes away any lingering John Carter cobwebs with his explosive performance, and John Travolta is funny and desperate as a DEA agent up to his ears in slime. Exciting as it is, ""Savages"" does slide off the rails during the last half hour. The film goes from intense to indulgent, plausible to preposterous. But it's still a pleasure to see Stone settle into this dark groove. B+ . See the full story at EW.com.

One motorist was caught traveling at 149mph along the M25 by a newly installed digital speed camera (file picture) The figures revealed that  another driver caught  by the same speed camera clocked up 146mph at Swanley on the M25, with two more hitting 127mph. New digital cameras have recently been installed on the M25 and older ones re-activated. The  offences were revealed in data received from police under a Freedom of Information Act request from the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM). The highest speed recorded on a 30mph road was 96mph in Leam Lane in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear – more than three times the legal limit. That just pipped the 94mph clocked up in the 30mph zone near New York Primary School on the B1192 Langrick Road in Lincolnshire. In other 30mph zones, drivers were  filmed doing  92mph on the B1522 in Gateshead; 86mph in  Court farm Road, Longwell Green, Avon and Somerset;  86mph in Luton’s Sundon Park Road, Bedfordshire; and 84mph on the A4103 at Leigh Sinton in West Mercia police’s area. The highest speed captured on a 50mph road was on the A414 Stanstead Abbotts, Hertfordshire, where a motorist clocked 119mph. The highest on a 60mph road was 127mph on the A413 Wendover bypass in Buckinghamshire. And one driver  hit 113mph in a 40mph A17 Station Road at Swineshead Bridge in Lincolnshire – some 73mph above the limit. The fastest speed recorded last year in a 30mph zone was 96mph, however, one motorist passed New York Primary school in Lincolnshire at 94 mph . The IAM report noted: ‘A motorist in on the M25 at Swanley holds the record for the highest speed clocked by a speed camera in England and Wales between April 2013 and May 2014.  The 149 mph figure was revealed following freedom of information requests to 39 police authorities.’ But the IAM says the penalties which ‘excessive speeders’ face are ‘out of sync’ with the danger they pose to other road users and to themselves. IAM head of road safety  Kevin Delaney said: ’Let’s be clear – we’re not talking here of otherwise law-abiding motorists who are trying their best but may make a careless mistake and slip a few miles per hour above the posted speed limited. ‘These are dangerous drivers who are  speeding at two or three times the legal speed limit, sometimes near schools. They are selfish individuals putting people’s lives in danger.’ Guidelines to magistrates on sentencing for speeding include a fine plus six penalty points  or disqualified  for between 7 and 56 days for motorists who drive  at 101mph  and 110mph on a 70mph road; at between 76mph  and 85 mph on a 50mph road; or at between 51mph and 60mph in a 30mph zone. IAM chief executive Simon Best said: ‘Speed limits are a limit. They are not a target to beat. Unfortunately this message has not got through to many motorists and it’s clear that efforts to make speeding as socially unacceptable as drink-driving continue to fail.’","The Institute of Advanced Motorists sent a Freedom of Information request seeking speeding details .

ffbe9dbd592717221313ac81dee65348cd829c7a,"(CNN) -- The long-anticipated Apple smartwatch became a reality this week when the tech giant unveiled its entry into the growing wearable-tech field. The Apple Watch, which comes in three styles and two sizes with multiple options for colors and wristbands, was expected to energize a market that's been slow to catch on as smartwatches from competitors such as Samsung, Sony, LG and Pebble rolled out over the past two years. More than just a tiny smartphone, the Apple Watch, which hits the market early next year, packs a ton of watch-specific features. It has a ""crown"" knob to control scrolling and zoom without having to touch the screen, silent pulse notifications, a slate of health and fitness apps and compatibility with Apple's new Apple Pay app, which lets users scan and pay card-free at participating stores. But there are also questions. The company is still mum on many of the device's specifications, including memory, screen resolution and -- most crucially -- battery life. The exact differences between the low-, middle- and high-end watches are also still blurry. The watch must be tethered to an iPhone -- some observers had hoped for a standalone device -- and its $350 price tag is more than many were expecting. So did the company do enough to make Apple Watch a breakthrough device that will shake up the gadget market the way its iPod, iPhone and iPad did? Many analysts said they think so. ""The Apple Watch defines the category in ways that other competitors will now have to work furiously to catch up to,"" said James McQuivey, a tech analyst at Forrester Research. ""In classic Apple style, the company has introduced a new interface -- the digital crown along with a tap and touch capable surface -- that will make Apple's watch experience significantly easier to use than anybody else's."" While many competitors have released a single smartwatch, sometimes in designs that have been panned for being bulky and unfashionable, Apple's trademark attention to design could make a difference, said Carolina Milanesi, chief researcher at Kantar Worldpanel ComTech. That's true, she said, even if the features Apple showcased won't come close to making a smartphone unnecessary. ""I do think smartwatches are still a nice-to-have versus a must-have -- more a convenience than a necessity, which is why appealing more from a style perspective might win more users in the short term,"" she said. Whether that pushes competitors in the same direction remains to be seen. ""Longer term I think we need to wait and see,"" Milanesi said. ""I am not sure we are totally clear as to what the true role of these wearable devices really is, especially as the Internet of Things materializes."" Forrester Research's J.P. Gownder said he's convinced that Apple Watch will push smartwatches into the mainstream in a way that devices running Google's Android Wear haven't managed. ""Apple will legitimize and create the mass-market wearables category,"" he said. McQuivey said he doesn't expect the Apple Watch to catch on with consumers as quickly as the iPad, which first introduced most people to the concept of a tablet computer. He noted how Apple CEO Tim Cook repeatedly referred to the device as a ""personal"" device and said that could be the key to wide appeal. From design to health monitoring to the Apple Pay feature, the watch could become a seamless piece of people's day-to-day lives, not a mere novelty, he said. ""As a longtime Pebble watch wearer, I can attest to the number of ways a watch, because of its glanceability and its one-touch efficiency, helps you get things done more quickly than before, causing you to do them even more,"" he said. But what about the people who just don't wear watches, or those who have found, in a smartphone, a suitable replacement? Milanesi said there's a chance that even those consumers will come on board. After all, who thought they wanted a tablet computer before Apple showcased the iPad? ""There are users that never wore a watch who happily spent money on a fitness band, so I do not see why not,"" Milanesi said. ""Is it for everyone? No, of course not. But there is a market out there, especially of Apple users who see the benefits of having multiple Apple devices working together.""

Rainfall for England and Northern Ireland so far is just under the full-month average, while Wales has been the driest relatively speaking – with 83.2mm of rain making up 77 per cent of its full-month average. Normally at this stage you would expect about 42 per cent of the average to have fallen. With regards to temperatures and sunshine, the month has been much closer to average so far. The UK mean temperature is currently 15.2C, which is 0.3C above the full-month average. UK sunshine hours are at 77.8 hours, which is 48 per cent of the full-month average – so just ahead of where we’d expect after 13 days of the month. While these figures are interesting, they don’t tell us where the month will end up overall – we’ll have to wait until the full-month figures are in before deciding where this August fits in to the records. As we head in to next week there should be a good deal of drier weather but with northerly winds bringing in cooler air it will feel colder than of late, especially at night. This will feel noticeably cool in the wind, so people heading out in the evening may want to take a few extra layers. Source: Met Office .

It's normally him who's doing the spinning - but this time David Cameron was on the receiving end. The PM was at Sri Lanka's National Cricket Academy where he faced up to one of the sport's greatest ever bowlers from 22 yards. Sri Lanka's spin king Muttiah Muralitharan, or Murali, as he is affectionately known, is the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket - but he didn't have it all his own way. Prime Minister David Cameron faces the bowling of Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan at Colombo's National Cricket Academy . According to onlookers, Mr Cameron acquitted himself well when he pitted his batting . skills against Muralitharan, although he later admitted the retired star may have gone a little easy on him. Mr Cameron is in Colombo to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government . Meeting, and was also given a working over on politics by the sportsman. Muralitharan suggested the Prime Minister had been 'misled' about the latest situation in the war-scarred north of the island. Mr Cameron is pressing the Sri Lankan regime to do more to improve conditions for the minority Tamil population still suffering the effects of a 26-year civil war which ended in 2009. Yesterday he visited families still unable to return to their homes after spending 20 years in refugee camps, in the first visit by a foreign leader to the region since 1948. In what he described as 'frank' talks with president Mahinda Rajapaksa the PM said he would press for an international investigation of alleged war crimes if the regime failed to hold a credible one by March.

They were there to talk about the sportsman's initiative to bring together youngsters from Tamil and other communities through cricket as part of post-war reconciliation efforts. But asked about the politician's calls for more action from the government of Mr Rajapaksa - which has been criticised internationally over human rights abuses - Muralitharan, a Tamil, said Mr Cameron was underestimating the improvements already made. 'I'm a sportsman and we don't think about politics,' he told reporters. 'My opinion is, there were problems in the last 30 years in those areas. Mr Cameron later admitted the retired star may have gone a little easy on him . 'Nobody could move there. In wartime I went with the UN, I saw the place, how it was. Now I regularly go and I see the place and it is about a 1,000 per cent improvement in facilities. 'Cricket is the main game to narrow the bridge between the people. But facilities-wise, schools are built, roads are built. Businesses are started. So many things have happened. It is improving. 'Thanks to the Sri Lankan army, they are putting a lot of effort there. This country is 20-odd million people. In the north there are only one million people. They are getting more attention than the south at the moment.' Mr Cameron later tweeted this picture and said: 'He went easy on me - but at least I can say Murali didn't get me out...' Gloves off: David Cameron speaks with Sri Lankan spin bowler Muttaiah Muralitharan (left) after trying his hand at batting . Asked about Mr Cameron's stance, Muralitharan said: 'He must have been misled by other people. 'People speak without going and seeing the things there. I go on and off. I see from my eyes there is improvement. 'I can't say the Prime Minister is wrong or not. He's from England, he hasn't seen the site, he hasn't gone and visited these places - yesterday only. 'But other than that, the political side ... basically what we want is food, shelter, education, happiness in the family.' Mr Cameron said it was an 'enormous pleasure' to meet the bowler - who took a record 800 Test wickets.

'I would say what matters is not everything I was told but what I myself have said, and I think I've given a fair reflection of some of the things that need to happen in terms of reconciliation, in terms of progress, in terms of human rights, free speech, and I think it's important to raise these issues.'

She has warned the country is heading in an increasingly authoritarian direction. 'If that investigation is not completed by March then I will use our position on the UN Human Rights Council to work with the UN Human Rights Commissioner and call for a full, credible and independent international inquiry,' Mr Cameron told reporters. He said he had urged Mr Rajapaksa to act to provide homes for refugees, end the intimidation and beating of journalists and work with newly elected Tamil regional leaders. 'I accept it takes time but what matters is being on the right pathway, getting on the right track,' he said. While Mr Cameron has attended, the Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, and Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Signh have confirmed they will not attend . 'It was a frank meeting. Of course not . everything I said was accepted. But I sensed that they do want to make . progress on these issues and it will help, frankly, by having . international pressure.' Mr Cameron has come under fire from campaigners for not joining the leaders of Canada, India and Mauritius in boycotting the summit in protest over human rights. But he insisted that his visit justified his judgment that he could achieve more by attending and using the occasion to highlight issues and raise them directly. 'Britain has shown that we will stand up for our values and do all we can to advance them, Of course, you can only do that by being here.' Mr Cameron had another short meeting before leaving the summit with Mr Rajapaksa at the request of the Sri Lankan leader - which he hailed as a sign that progress could be made. 'We discussed more of the issues we discussed yesterday,' he said. 'I think that demonstrates really two things: first of all you can have frank and clear conversations but an ongoing dialogue. 'Secondly these issues are not solved by one visit, this is not a flash in the pan, it's a dialogue, a conversation, pressure that we need to keep up over the longer term and I'm committed to doing that.' He was speaking as he arrived in Dubai to press the case for British firms seeking orders for aircraft at its airshow, which starts tomorrow.

Groundbreaking: Truvada will be available as a preventive measure for people who are at high risk of acquiring HIV through sexual activity . A drug that protects people at risk of HIV from infection has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The pill, called Truvada, has been approved as a preventive . measure for people who are at high risk of acquiring the infection, such as those who have HIV-infected partners. The FDA said it marked 'an important milestone in our fight against HIV.' Public health advocates say the approval could help slow the spread . of HIV, which has held steady at about 50,000 new infections per year . for the last 15 years. However, other campaigners have warned that the pills could give patients a false sense of security. An estimated 1.2 million Americans and 83,000 people in the UK have HIV, . which develops into AIDS unless treated with antiviral drugs. With an . estimated 240,000 HIV carriers unaware of their status, doctors and . patients say new methods are needed to fight the spread of the virus. Truvada combines two anti-HIV drugs in one pill. It has been marketed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for people who are already infected with the virus in 2004. But starting in 2010, studies showed that the drug could actually . prevent people from contracting HIV when used as a precautionary . measure. A three-year study found that daily doses cut the risk of . infection in healthy gay and bisexual men by 42 per cent, when . accompanied by condoms and counseling. Last year another study found that Truvada reduced infection by 75 . percent in heterosexual couples in which one partner was infected with . HIV and the other was not. Antis: Groups including the AIDS Healthcare Foundation asked the FDA to reject the new indication, saying it could give patients a false sense of security and reduce the use of condoms . Because Truvada is on the market to manage HIV, some doctors already . prescribe it as a preventive measure. FDA approval will allow Gilead . Sciences to formally market the drug for that use, which could . dramatically increase prescribing. Truvada's groundbreaking preventive ability has exposed disagreements . about managing the disease among those in the HIV community. Groups . including the AIDS Healthcare Foundation asked the FDA to reject the new . indication, saying it could give patients a false sense of security and . reduce the use of condoms, the most reliable preventive measure against . HIV. The drug can help prevent a person becoming infected with HIV . AHF President Michael Weinstein, said: 'The FDA’s approval of Gilead’s Truvada as a form of HIV prevention today without any requirement for HIV testing is completely reckless and a move that will ultimately set back years of HIV prevention efforts.' But FDA scientists said there was no indication from . clinical trials that Truvada users were more likely to engage in risky . sexual behavior. 'What we found was that condom use increased over time and sexually . transmitted infections either remained at baseline levels or decreased,' said Dr Debra Birnkrant, FDA's director of antiviral products. 'So in . essence, we don't have any strong evidence that condoms were not used or . there was a decrease in condom use.'","Public health advocates say pill could slow spread of HIV .

ffbfbbd188e776f3e2800a71dc9d024e02d7e579,"(CNN) -- Silverstone, the host of the British Grand Prix, has unveiled a multi-million dollar revamp of their pit lane and paddock facilities called ""The Wing."" The $43m development began after Silverstone secured a 17-year contract to stage the British Grand Prix back in 2009. Part of the agreement stipulated the circuit must be upgraded and five former British world champions, including current McLaren driver Jenson Button, were on hand to help launch the new building. It has three floors and a distinctive wing at one end. Designed by the architects who were behind the London 2012 Olympic Stadium it includes 41 garages, a new media center, hospitality suites, a conference center and a new VIP spectator area. Button was joined by former British champions John Surtees (1964), Jackie Stewart (1969, 1971, 1973), Nigel Mansell (1992) and Damon Hill, the 1996 title holder, and head of the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC) which runs Silverstone. He said: ""The official opening of the Silverstone Wing represents the culmination of many years hard work and gives a clear statement of intent for the future. ""Silverstone has a significant historical legacy, but we maintain our place at the forefront of contemporary international motor sport, hosting an array of world class events and activities. ""This is in no small measure because British competitors have consistently led the way at the highest level of global motor sport for over eighty years. ""The BRDC is extremely proud of this new building, but we acknowledge that none of it would have been possible without our superb and exceptional Silverstone team. ""Silverstone is a cornerstone of our industry and the BRDC will continue to develop the circuit to ensure that Britain has a world class home for motor sport and related technology."" Silverstone staged the British Grand Prix from 1948 onwards but was stripped of the race in favor of Donington Park in 2008. After concerns the new venue would not be ready in time Silverstone was handed a 17-year contract a little over 12 months later. Formula One rights holder Bernie Ecclestone, who insisted on the pit lane development when re-awarding Silverstone the British GP, called the opening of 'The Wing' an ""important day for Formula One."" He added: ""The new pit and paddock complex is a state-of-the-art facility and will form the backbone of Silverstone's plans to be a world class facility of its type. ""I am delighted with the progress and prospects for the future of Silverstone.

Donna Matthews arriving at Blackburn Magistrates Court. She was convicted of using threatening behavior after trying to punch her daughter in the face in a 'drink-fuelled' brawl . A police officer was punched, kicked and bitten by a mob of school children after he tried to stop a mother and daughter from fighting outside in pyjamas. Donna Matthews, 46, was spotted by the officer trying to punch her daughter in the face, before banging her face on a stone step outside her house in Blackburn, Lancashire. The officer tried to break up the alcohol-fuelled brawl, but was attacked by three children aged seven, ten and 13, who proceeded to bite, punch and kick him at the moment he was pulling the mother away from the daughter. Defending, Jonathan Taylor told Blackburn Magistrates Court that she has had an alcohol problem since she was 16. She began arguing with her daughter after the pair had been drinking. The police officer saw the two women, one wearing a white vest and pyjama bottoms and the other wearing a white onesie, fighting at the front of the house. Mr Taylor said: 'The officer was outside another address attending an unrelated incident when he saw a fight spill out of the house. 'He witnessed both women punching each other and Matthews tried to smash her daughter’s face into stone steps. 'Her daughter tried to gouge her eyes out and Matthews was in an extreme amount of pain. 'They were exchanging blows during the scuffle. 'As the officer tried to break up the fight, he was attacked by three children of primary school age - something he has not witnessed in 12 years as a police officer.' He calmed the situation but when he later said he was going to arrest their mother, the children attacked him again. Mr Taylor said Matthews’ daughter did not have any significant injuries and accepted she was equally to blame for the behaviour. The police officer (not pictured) said he had never experience anything like the attack in 12 years of police work . Matthews suffered a black eye and a cut to her nose and pleaded guilty to using threatening behaviour.

ffc039906291dbc1ad923daf591c63b604c55160,"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Nearly 27 years ago, amid a crowd of people in Central Park, Ruth Bendik's wallet was stolen. The culprit is still at large, but the wallet has been found -- in the hollow trunk of a cherry tree. Nearly 27 years ago, amid a crowd of people in Central Park, Ruth Bendik's wallet was stolen. The wallet was snatched on October 24, 1982, while Bendik, now 69, was in Central Park watching the New York marathon. She went to greet runners at the end of the race and, ""when I got out of the crush of people, I realized my purse was much lighter,"" Bendik told CNN. ""I was just so grateful not to have been harmed."" Last week, Josh Galiley, tree-care supervisor for the Central Park Conservancy, was chopping down a hazardous black cherry tree near Rumsey Playfield when he discovered her blue leather wallet in the trunk of the tree, which he estimates is around 65 years old and 50 feet high. ""I started poking in the soft stuff and this wallet turned up. Having been that low in the tree ... the location indicated it had been there for quite some time,"" Galiley told CNN. The old wallet was a unique find, he said. ""When you're cutting a tree and it's hollow, you expect stuff inside, shreds of material, old marbles, really just knickknacks compared to this,"" he said, ""Nothing with a story. ... We peeked in and there were dates from the early '80s. We figured this was different."" After the wallet was recovered, Galiley said, officials were careful to inform Bendik properly. ""We thought she may not want to relive it,"" he said. Bendik sang praises for the individuals who returned her wallet, including detective Frank Irizarry, who helped track her down. ""The lengths they went to find me, the extent that they went through and the fact that they were concerned about my feelings really impressed me,"" she said. The wallet still contained her old driver's license and credit cards, she said, although $20 was missing. ""Twenty dollars was a lot of money then,"" she said. After two decades, much more has changed. Referring to two of her old bank cards from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Bank and Banker's Trust, Bendik said, ""I was shocked that both banks had closed."" But some things haven't changed. Bendik continues to have fond memories of Central Park. The Ohio native, who has lived in New York for 40 years, still describes the park as one of her favorite areas in the city. ""It's a public place in an impersonal city,"" she said, ""It brings everyone together in a pleasant way of reconnecting with nature and beauty."" Today, Bendik smiles at the idea of her wallet buried in a cherry tree in Central Park for nearly 30 years, and she's happy to have it in her hands again. ""After all these years it's still available as a time capsule of my life.""","Ruth Bendik's wallet was snatched in 1982 during the New York marathon .

A fast food lover who ate takeaways every night has gone from fat to fit after she embarked upon a healthy eating regime and took up regular exercise. Now she is so addicted to working out that she has become a competitive body builder. Lola Adeoye, from Grays, Essex, who weighed 15st, completely abandoned her former unhealthy lifestyle, transforming her body to become a muscular bodybuilder. And last year, after losing seven stone, 43-year-old Lola began regularly competing in bodybuilding competitions for the first time. After starting with spin classes, Lola became a dedicated gym bunny, concentrating on weight training and diet . Lola, 43, said: 'I can't believe how much my life has changed. I went from eating takeaways every night to attending spin classes six times a week. 'I feel so much healthier, and I absolutely love competing. 'It's strange because when you do the work you don't immediately see the change in your body. But then I won Most Improved in Miss Galaxy International - the UK's first ever beauty and fitness pageant - and it spurred me on.' After starting with spin classes, Lola became a dedicated gym bunny, concentrating on weight training and diet - she even has an impressive six pack as proof of her hard work. Lola was forced to take control of her weight after an appointment at her local hospital. Lola was forced to take control of her weight after an appointment at her local hospital . 'I'd been in and out of hospital with gallstones and found out that I was going to need surgery to remove them. 'I went to the doctor for a pre-surgery consultation when I was asked to jump on the scales. 'I hated weighing myself anyway, but when I saw that I weighed almost 15st I was humiliated. 'Then the the doctor looked up at me and said 'Never mind, we'll get you back to your fish and chips in no time.' 'It was so embarrassing but it was the motivation I need to sort myself out, I knew right then and there that things need to change!' Just four months after she began weights Lola's trainer suggested she enter a competition . Lola vowed to start using the gym membership that she'd had for years, and two weeks after her surgery she finally attended her first class.'I had originally signed up to a legs, bums and tums class, but when I turned up I was the only one there. 'The instructor thought it was pointless to do a class on my own so she took me along to a spin class that was going on at the same time. 'As soon as I got on the bike I loved it! The lively music and great energy in the room just had me hooked. 'The music definitely helps you forget the pain you're in too!' In the space of just five months Lola had lost four dress sizes, going down from a size 20 to a size 12. She was at the gym so much that she even began teaching classes there. But Lola found she struggled to shift any more weight on exercise alone, and began a strict regime of clean eating to lose even more. 'Clean eating is where you only eat complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, lean protein and about four litres of water every day. Proud Lola is now teaching her own classes to inspire others to follow in her footsteps . 'It really worked for me and I lost even more weight.' But unhappy with her now very slender frame, Lola began weight training to give more shape to her body. 'When I was a size six I was so scrawny and just didn't feel comfortable. I was too slim and scrawny and I couldn't find any clothes to fit me. 'I started weight training just to give me a few extra curves, but I ended up really enjoying it. 'It meant I could eat even more too. I still keep to the clean eating diet, but I eat about 3,000 calories which includes seven small meals and four protein shakes. 'When I look back on what I was like before and I don't know how I let myself get into such bad shape' 'Four months after I began weights my trainer suggested I should enter a competition. I love a challenge so I jumped at the chance. 'I entered my first competition but I was told I needed time to build up my myself - so I took a break and this year I was ready to compete regularly. 'I won my first title, Most Improved, at Miss Galaxy Universe in May this year. 'It was incredible to be rewarded for all my hard work! 'I was self-conscious about my muscles at first, I know some people might think it strange for a woman to be so muscular, but as soon as people started complimenting me on my hard work I wasn't bothered at all. 'I feel really proud of what I've managed to achieve.' Lola now hopes teaching her own classes will inspire others to follow in her footsteps. 'When I tell my students how big I was before they don't believe me. 'They can't recognise me in pictures and are shocked at how I lost so much. 'But I'm living proof that it can be done, and I get so proud when I see people who have used me as their inspiration. 'I look back on what my life was like before and I don't know how I let myself get into such bad shape. 'People used to shout at me from across the street, and I was just dismissed as a fat girl.

ffc0b0231bb653c39ab62677e0b513cdff341d48,"Fat people live longer than their skinny counterparts because their brains get more nourishment under stress, a German obesity expert has claimed. Achim Peters says that overweight people are more suited to the stresses of modern life because their metabolisms are better able deal with it. Professor Peters, of Luebeck University in northern Germany and author of the book 'Overweight Myths - Why Fat People Live Longer,' has been studying the . brain and weight related issues for three decades. He says it is a . myth that fat people die sooner than their thin counterparts. Fat people live longer because their brains get more nourishment under stress, a leading obesity expert has claimed . He said: 'People react to a stressful, uncertain circumstances in two different ways. Some eat and become fat. 'The others refuse food and become thin. The ones who become really ill are the thin ones. The fat ones are, in comparison with the thin ones, much healthier.' He added that being thin in itself not a problem, but those who lose weight when under stress are in danger. 'We have to worry much more about the thin stressed people than about the fat stressed people. Yet they are not regarded widely as having a problem precisely because they are thin. But in fact they die earliest.' Professor Peters told a German newspaper that he and his colleagues studied 'toxic stress' brought on by factors outside of an individual's control, such as poverty, bullying, abuse, divorce, low self-esteem and trouble in the workplace. People who don't eat when they're stressed are in danger, as their brain gets nutrients from the muscles and organs, rather than food . Individuals who pile on the pounds under such circumstance 'get the nutrients they need to feed their brains. 'When the brain doesn't get them from external sources, it gets them from within - from muscles and even worse, from the organs. Thin stressed people are the least healthy people.' He went on: 'So far, only the relationship between being overweight and mortality has been studied. The cause of the mortality is not in just being overweight, it lies in stress.' He said that 'social imbalances' that lead to stress cannot be fixed with diets - rather, it is the duty of government to worry about taking away the stresses of modern day life to get people to shed some weight. 'Society needs to change, not fat people,' he added. Asked if there is an ideal weight, he said; 'No. Modern research speaks only of weight diversity. Every human being has the survival strategy ideal for his or her life. 'The ostracism of fatties puts pressure on fat people psychologically.' Indeed, he said, there are studies that prove that fat people earn less, are fired faster and are more often bullied. He added that the idea that slimness equals beauty 'contributes greatly to the misfortunes of the overweight'. 'If you look carefully there were or are stressful circumstances for fat people who do not seem stressed. But these people have found a solution. 'They have become stress tolerant and in return, get a balanced mood. But they have to pay a price for this - eating.' There are anti-stress therapies which he said were effective in the longer term and could alter eating behaviour and lead to weight loss.","People who don't eat when stressed are in danger, warns Achim Peters .
Thin people's brains take nutrients from their muscles and organs .
This is riskier for their health than being fat, and affects life expectancy .
But fat people don't have such risks as they are better nourished ."
ffc0d70b1c1f65a39121ff440756b0ab44deb898,"It seems that life really does begin at 40, if the latest string of celebrity romances is anything to go by. Cameron Diaz, George Clooney and Jennifer Aniston are just a few of the A-listers who have found love after the landmark birthday. Famed singleton Cameron, 42, who is known in the showbiz world as the eternal female bachelor, made waves  when she finally tied the knot with Good Charlotte rocker Benji Madden, 35, at their mansion in Beverly Hills. Scroll down for video . Cameron Diaz, 42,  once known  as the eternal female bachelor, tied the knot with tattooed rocker Benji Madden after only eight months together - and she's not the only A-lister finding love later on in life . Cameron has had her pick of men for the past two decades, dating everyone from Matt Dillon and Jared Leto to Justin Timberlake and baseball player Alex Rodriguez. The actress had always been adamant that she has no desire to settle down and marry, but after an eight-month whirlwind romance, the Annie actress tied the knot last week. 'We couldn't be happier to begin our new journey together surrounded by our closest family and friends,' the couple said in a statement to People magazine. Only last year, Cameron told the May issue of InStyle magazine that women should never feel under pressure to get married, saying: 'A lot of people chase after it because they've been told, ""This equals happiness"". They chase it, they get it.' The actress, here with new husband Benji, has always been adamant that she had no desire to settle down . Benji Madden, holistic expert Vicky Vlachonis, and actress Cameron Diaz together at a party . A year earlier, she told a magazine: 'It [marriage] just wasn't the thing I was drawn to. I certainly didn't want it in my 20s. Or my 30s. 'I don't need to have the children in my life be a part of my literal flesh. And anyway, there's still a possibility of that, I ain't that old.' Jennifer Aniston, the queen of the romcom that many feared might never find lasting love in real life, engaged Justin Theroux in 2012, when she was 43 . And she's not the only star following this mantra. Her good friend Jennifer Aniston, the queen of the rom-com who many feared might never find lasting love in real life, became to engaged Justin Theroux in 2012 aged 43. The actress starred in a steady stream of romantic comedy films since the end of the phenomenal TV hit Friends yet seemed unable to find lasting love after the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt. But she has been dating Theroux, an actor and screenwriter, for the last few years, and recently declared: 'Yes, I'm very happy. I'm extremely lucky, and I'm extremely happy.' Following her marriage split, Miss Aniston's high-profile romances made the headlines, most notably her time with womanising rock singer John Mayer, nine years her junior. She previously had a long-term relationship with actor Vince Vaughn, her co-star in The Break Up, before their split in 2006. She then dated British model Paul Sculfor for a few months in 2007, before moving on to her on-off romance with Mayer, 34. Theroux, who has never been married, was first linked with Miss Aniston in May 2011. Miss Aniston at the time confessed to being annoyed by the fact that she was seen to be unlucky in love, adding: 'It's very narrow-minded, I think. It doesn't measure the level or my happiness or success in my life and my achievements or any of that.' Just before meeting Theroux, she said she did plan to become a mother, and admitted: 'I think people honestly just want to see me as a mom and married and barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen. And I just want to say, “Everybody, relax! It's going to happen”.' George Clooney, 53, also once known as one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors, shocked fans when he married Amal Alamuddin last summer. Just a year before, he said he hadn't met the love of his life yet, but last summer, it seemed the search was well and truly over. Jennifer, with Justin Theroux, recently said: ' I'm very happy. I'm extremely lucky, and I'm extremely happy' George Clooney, pictured with wife Amal at the  Golden Globes on Monday night, finally remarried  aged 53 . After a whirlwind romance with the British human rights lawyer, George walked down the aisle in front of friends and family in Venice. George's love life before Amal was packed, with one of his first famous relationships being with actress Kelly Preston in 1987. George then entered into his most serious romance (up until Amal) when he reunited with his ex-girlfriend, fellow actress Talia Balsam, who he had already dated for three years. In 1989 the pair drove to Vegas in a Winnebago to tie the knot at a wedding officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator, but after three years the couple divorced reportedly over  arguments about money. Clooney admitted in a Vanity Fair interview: 'I probably – definitely – wasn't someone who should have been married at that point. I just don't feel like I gave Talia a fair shot.' He then went on to date Kimberly Russell, Vendela Kirsebom, Celine Balitran and Lisa Snowdon before finding love with Amal at the age of 53. After a whirlwind romance with Amal, George wed in front of friends and family in Venice last September . Simon Cowell has also seemingly found true love at 55, after welcoming a baby son with girlfriend Lauren Silverman last summer. And, although they've been in a relationship for well over a year - and welcomed their son Eric into the world in February - it appears the honeymoon phase is certainly not over. The couple were pictured looking loved up during their month-long stay in Barbados this week. Salma Hayek, meanwhile, is one of the most beautiful actresses of her generation - but she didn't settle down until the age of 42, when she tied the knot with French billionaire, Francois-Henri Pinault. The glamorous star, now 48, recently opened up about ageing and dressing to impress her husband in an interview with InStyle. Simon Cowell found love at 55, after welcoming a baby son with girlfriend Lauren Silverman last summer . Lauren SIlverman and Simon Cowell have been in a relationship for well over a year and have a baby son Eric . The mother-of-one also said: 'When I turned 40, I started thinking, ""This is the last year,"" whenever I’d wear a strapless dress,' she said. 'I always thought you can’t wear them after a certain age, but I’m still getting away with it. 'I’m not really a fashionista,' she said. 'I have an eye. I can pull it together, but a lot of the effort I make is for my husband, because I want him to be attracted to me.' Elle DeGeneres also proves that you can find true love later in life. She met Ally McBeal actress Portia de Rossi in 2004 at the age of 44. The  wed in 2008 after the overturn of the same-sex marriage ban in California. The talk show host denied divorce rumours to a March 2014 issue of People magazine, revealing: 'I love her so much it kills me. The truth is, and this is corny, I fall more in love with Portia all the time. I really do. 'She surprises me all the time. It's what anyone experiences when you find that person that gets you, wants to take care of you, wants the best for you. We're really lucky because we know how rare it is.' Salma Hayek didn't find love until the age of 42, when she married French billionaire, Francois-Henri Pinault . Salma, pictured at her 2009 wedding, makes an effort as  she still wants her husband to be attracted to her . Speaking about finding love later in life, celebrity life coach, Sloan Sheridan-Williams (sloansw.com), said: 'Finding love after 40 need not be daunting. The truth is the common factor in your relationships is you and therefore your life experience now puts you in a much better place to choose your perfect match resulting in long lasting love. 'By the time you reach 40, unlike young love you have understood the concept that your happiness is not the responsibility of another person. 'This results in better choices. By taking personal responsibility in life you can put in place the steps that will move you forward to attracting, not only the right partner, but one that complements you. 'Celebrities over 40 already have their career path planned, so their focus can now turn to relationships. 'There is a whole society of individuals that do not gain significance from relationships but from their career instead and as such attracting lasting love has not been their first priority. 'Your brain provides you that which you focus on with intense emotion and as such if that focus is not pointed towards your love life then it takes a back seat. 'The good news is that science is actually on your side. As we get older it is suggested that gender differences often displayed earlier in life mellow. This is because brain biochemistry is rebalancing the sex hormones that affect our behaviour. 'There is also research to suggest that passion increases with age, so a change of perception and a shift of focus towards bringing out your passionate side will allow you to nurture love once it comes along to an even stronger level than perhaps you would have had embarking on the same relationship earlier on in life. 'The key to finding love is to take action towards meeting people, to learn lessons from past experiences and to use your knowledge to give the best to your partner and to yourself.'

An astronaut aboard the International Space Station has become the first person ever to control a robot on earth from space. Flight engineer Chris Cassidy remotely controlled the K10 rover based in California from space to simulate deploying a radio telescope. The mini mission was designed to test how well a crew member in space can remotely control a robot, whether it is on the surface of a moon, planet or asteroid. Cassidy took the rover, based at the Ames Research Centre in California, on a remote test drive before using it to deploy the simulated antenna. NASA's K10 rover, based at the Ames Research Centre in California, performs a surface survey controlled by an astronaut on the International Space Station . Aboard the space station, he used live video from the rover and virtual terrain displays to give him a view of the rover's activities on Earth. The technology demonstration aimed to explore how communication delays over vast . distances affect an astronaut’s ability to take supervisory control of . an automated rover if it gets into a difficult area. Terry Fong, director of the Intelligent Robotics Group at Ames said: 'We successfully conducted the first ""surface telerobotics"" test session with the International Space Station. 'Cassidy used K10 to perform a surface site survey and to begin deploying a simulated Kapton film-based radio antenna.' Astronaut Chris Cassidy controls the rover from the Surface Telerobotics Workspace aboard the International Space Station . Cassidy uses the surface telerobotics technology (pictured) to drive the rover on earth before performing the delicate operation of deploying the simulated antenna. The demonstration aims to explore how the communication delays over vast distances affect an astronaut's ability to operate a robot . Fong told Space.com that further test drives between the rover and the space station will take place in July and August. They will concentrate on completing and inspecting the antenna deployment as well as studying the interaction between the human and the robot. The test is the first simulation of a human-robot 'waypoint' mission, which involves an idea to deploy a telescope on the far side of the moon. The concept is proposed by experts at the University of Colorado and Lockheed Martin, which is building the multi-purpose Orion spacecraft for Nasa. The K10 rover carries out a surface study using its cameras and on-board laser system. Such a robot could be used to deploy a radio telescope on the far side of the moon in the future . The proposed mission to the Earth-moon L2 position, would see astronauts on board an Orion spacecraft remotely place a low radio frequency telescope on the far side of the moon, using robots. The aim of the mission is to track down the 'cosmic dawn' of the universe that followed within 100 million years of the Big Bang. The location has been chosen as it is a 'radio quiet place' in the inner solar system, which will allow sensitive observations to be made about the first stars and galaxies. Cassidy was one of the astronauts to make a rare, hastily planned space walk from the International Space Station in May this year. He helped to replace a pump outside the station to plug a serious coolant leak.

ffc19c87f8ca7d17915939905f675d24813ff89b,"ROME, Italy (CNN) -- When Anna Elisa Fattori arrives at work the first thing she does is to take off her clothes. All of them. For Fattori is a professional nude model working at Rome's art academy. Anna Elisa Fattori: ""You are trying to give inspiration to the students."" ""It is a tough job!"" she tells me just before beginning to pose for a group of students, eager to paint her gracious figure. There is something striking about her bright green eyes and wavy red hair. ""It doesn't seem to be hard, but you know, try it! Put yourself in front of the mirror and then stay for a long time in a pose. You start: 'Oh my back, oh something is strange here...'"" she says, mimicking pain on her lower back. Fattori is one of about 300 people in Italy who do this job, but only about 50 of them have full-time contracts. She makes the equivalent of about $1,500 each month, but only works three months per year. And that is why she and others recently went on strike, demanding a full-time wage for work they say not everyone can do. ""It is not easy because you are naked, so you have to be very comfortable with your body and have a nice relationship with everybody,"" she says as the students look on, ""but not too open and not too close. You are trying to give inspiration to the students. If we lose these artistic roots that are very important to Italy then we lose a big part of our identity."" Italian Renaissance art is filled with naked men and women: Think of Michelangelo's David or Botticelli's Venus. But back then artists mostly used prostitutes and lovers as models and muses, often with the complicity of priests who wanted the walls of their churches painted by famous names. ""Priests allowed prostitutes to use churches,"" explains Enrico Bruschini, one of Rome's best known art historians. ""Officially it was to convert them, but the practical reason was to have the artist at the church."" Bruschini says that the Saint Augustine church, a stone's throw from Piazza Navona, was a famous gathering point in Rome for Renaissance artists looking for ""inspiration."" Back then though professional modeling did not exist, and most would agree that the art didn't really suffer from its absence. So if Botticelli and Raphael could do without professional models, what is the big deal now? ""It all started with the rise of art schools in the 19th and 20th centuries"" says Fattori. ""During the Renaissance you just thought that a prostitute can be a model or even a lover. But now we are here, so we need to move ahead."" Art students hoping to become the next Michelangelo agree. ""I think a person should have talent,"" argues Anastasia Kurakina, a first year student from Russia. ""Because you, for example, you couldn't [model]... I don't know you, but Anna Elisa has talent."" Anastasia is right, I certainly couldn't do it -- but unbeknownst to me she used me as a model while I was interviewing Fattori. Thankfully I was fully dressed, so all she drew was my head. And she didn't to a bad job at that. E-mail to a friend .","Italy's art models have gone on strike, demanding they get a full-time wage .

The anger is rooted in this cultural shift: We're at a tipping point where hotel guests value Internet access as they would a bed and hot water, says Greif. ""You can't live without it."" 10 budget all-inclusive resorts . To hammer the point home, let's state the obvious: Hotels are not going to be charging a fee to have a bed included in your room. ""It matters to me,"" says Neil Glick, a Washington, D.C.-based real estate agent who says he always looks for hotel Wi-Fi, especially when vacationing overseas. It's not as important in the States, he says, because he can surf on his phone. But, ""internationally it gets real expensive real fast to use 3G."" For the data heads, here are the stats: J.D. Power gathered information from thousands of consumers about their overall satisfaction about hotel costs and fees. The rating plunged 76 points this year: 16 points lower than last year's survey. Power blames it on hotel Internet charges. Fifty-five percent of hotel guests use the Internet during their hotel stay, the study says, up from 20% in 2006. Of those, 87% connect by Wi-Fi. Eleven percent of guests who use the Internet said they paid an additional fee to connect. Rules and rates for luxury hotel Internet access are far from universal. Some luxury hotels offer Internet access for members of loyalty programs, like Ritz-Carlton's Club Level, although some Ritz-Carltons provide free Internet access in hotel lobbies. Wiring a hotel for Wi-Fi can be pricier than one might expect. A line capable of delivering 100 megabits of data per second can cost in the range of $3,000 to $4,000 per month, says Don O'Neal, a veteran hotel consultant for Internet infrastructure. He says an upscale New York hotel he's familiar with has two 20 megabit connections with a monthly cost between $700 to $800 each. ""It is expensive,"" says Joe McInerney of the American Hotel & Lodging Association. ""And somebody has to pay for it."" He says high-end hotels aren't able to add another $15 or $20 to their room rates, which is why they charge the fees. ""If you're not going to use it, then why should you pay for it?"" Competition at budget and moderately priced hotels is more intense because consumers often make their hotel choices based solely on price. They expect rates with amenities rolled in. Wi-Fi is like breakfast. At a luxury hotel, breakfast will cost you. Budget hotels are likely to throw in coffee and a bagel. Confessions of a hotel mystery shopper . What really gets guests' goat, according to the survey, is when hotels charge for Internet via so-called ""resort fees."" Nickel and diming fuels resentment, Greif says, because guests feel like they're being charged extra for something they give away down the street at the neighborhood coffee shop. Industry experts see increased use of a tiered system of Web access, perhaps offering basic Internet free and then charging for higher data access for things like watching video or playing online games. Not only do hotel guests want more bandwidth, they also want to use more devices in their rooms -- cell phones, laptops and tablets. Many hotels seem to be behind the tech curve. ""It's part of the whole catch-up,"" says Greif. ""Hotels are still trying to run on the lower cost structure from the economic downturn."" Consumer demands are bouncing back with the economy, he says, but hotels aren't catching up quickly enough. ""Internet access is a big part of that."" The cost and fees data is part of a larger survey of more than 61,000 hotel guests from the United States and Canada. Overall, the survey has a 1,000-point scale. This year's overall score is 757, which is down seven points from last year, measured across seven types of hotels, from economy/budget to extended stay to luxury. The Ritz-Carlton topped the survey in the luxury category with 864 points. In the economy/budget bracket, Jameson Inn received 751. Other top hotels in their categories included Omni Hotels & Resorts, Homewood Suites, Drury Hotels, Hilton Garden Inn and Holiday Inn. Customer satisfaction with guest rooms in the survey has dropped within a point of its lowest level in the past seven years. A new part of the annual survey examines opinions of hotel staff. Fifty-six percent of respondents said they had a high opinion of hotel staff, 34% said average and 10% said their opinion was low. Experts suggested that hotels were slow to respond to rising consumer expectations as the nation's economy improves. Do you pay for Wi-Fi at hotels?

The space agency used satellite data to create an estimate of the water needed to end a drought for the first time. They say it will help planners, who recently found California's three year drought is the worst seen for over 1200 years. Scroll down for video . The dry bed of the Stevens Creek Reservoir in California: A combination of record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during California's three-year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 years. NASA GRACE satellite data reveal the severity of California's drought on water resources across the state. This map shows the trend in water storage between September 2011 and September 2014. Image Credit: NASA JPL . The finding was presented by Nasa scientists at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco. 'Spaceborne and airborne measurements of Earth's changing shape, surface height and gravity field now allow us to measure and analyse key features of droughts better than ever before, including determining precisely when they begin and end and what their magnitude is at any moment in time,' Jay Famiglietti of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena said. 'That's an incredible advance and something that would be impossible using only ground-based observations.' A team of scientists used data from Nasa's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites to develop the first-ever calculation of this kind - the volume of water required to end an episode of drought. Earlier this year, at the peak of California's current three-year drought, the team found that water storage in the state's Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins was 11 trillion gallons below normal seasonal levels. Data collected since the launch of GRACE in 2002 shows this deficit has increased steadily. Since 2011, the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins decreased in volume by four trillion gallons of water each year (15 cubic kilometers). That's more water than California's 38 million residents use each year for domestic and municipal purposes. About two-thirds of the loss is due to depletion of groundwater beneath California's Central Valley. In related results, early 2014 data from NASA's Airborne Snow Observatory indicate that snowpack in California's Sierra Nevada range was only half of previous estimates. The observatory is providing the first-ever high-resolution observations of snow water volume in the Tuolumne River, Merced, Kings and Lakes basins of the Sierra Nevada and Uncompahgre watershed in the Upper Colorado River Basin. To develop these calculations, the observatory measures how much water is in the snowpack and how much sunlight the snow absorbs, which influences how fast the snow melts. These data enable accurate estimates of how much water will flow out of a basin when the snow melts, which helps guide decision about reservoir filling and water allocation. The low water level of California's Lake Kaweah, February 5, 2014. Now in its third straight year of unprecedented drought, California is experiencing its driest year on record, dating back 119 years and possible the worst in the past 500 years. 'The 2014 snowpack was one of the three lowest on record and the worst since 1977, when California's population was half what it is now,' said Airborne Snow Observatory principal investigator Tom Painter of JPL. 'Besides resulting in less snow water, the dramatic reduction in snow extent contributes to warming our climate by allowing the ground to absorb more sunlight. This reduces soil moisture, which makes it harder to get water from the snow into reservoirs once it does start snowing again.' New drought maps show groundwater levels across the U.S. Southwest are in the lowest two to 10 percent since 1949. A combination of . record high temperatures and sparse rainfall during California's . three-year drought have produced the worst conditions in 1,200 . years, according to a study accepted for publication by the . American Geophysical Union (AGU). 'The current California drought is exceptionally severe in . the context of at least the last millennium and is driven by . reduced though not unprecedented precipitation and record high . temperatures,' the report's authors said in the study released . late Thursday. The study by the University of Minnesota and the Woods Hole . Oceanographic Institution said that warm, dry conditions have . shrunk the supply of surface water from reservoirs, streams and . the Sierra Nevada snowpack in the state, even as demand from . people and farms has gone up, resulting in unprecedented . scarcity. Daniel Griffin, an assistant professor in the Department of Geography, Environment and Society at the University of Minnesota, and Kevin Anchukaitis, an assistant scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, asked the question, 'How unusual is the ongoing California drought?' and collected new tree-ring samples from blue oak trees in southern and central California. 'We were genuinely surprised at the result,' says Griffin, a NOAA Climate & Global Change Fellow and former WHOI postdoctoral scholar. 'One thing is clear, drought is going to continue to happen. This is the kind of thing we get to see in the future.' The maps, developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, combine GRACE data with other satellite observations. 'Integrating GRACE data with other satellite measurements provides a more holistic view of the impact of drought on water availability, including on groundwater resources, which are typically ignored in standard drought indices,' said Matt Rodell, chief of the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at Goddard. The scientists cautioned that while the recent California storms have been helpful in replenishing water resources, they aren't nearly enough to end the multi-year drought. 'It takes years to get into a drought of this severity, and it will likely take many more big storms, and years, to crawl out of it,' said Famiglietti.","Current short-term drought  worse than any previous span of consecutive years of drought without reprieve .

The 23-year-old private first class was shot in the shoulder after midnight on Saturday during the incident, according to Yonhap, a government-affiliated South Korean news agency. South Korean police claim the soldier tried to run over a police officer on a dead-end street, according to Yonhap. The officer fired a warning shot and three shots into the car, but the car sped away and was later found near the Yongsan Garrison, home of the 8th U.S. Army in South Korea, Yonhap said.

The company says this marks the first commercial use of fully automated drones worldwide. It will fulfill deliveries in Sydney using six drones to start, dropping off textbook purchases at an outdoor location of the customer's choosing. To wipe away any potential privacy or surveillance fears, the drones aren't equipped with cameras. Instead, built-in anti-collision technology keeps them clear of trees, buildings, birds, and other potential obstacles. Both the location of the user and the drone's GPS coordinates are transmitted via a smartphone app, and Zookal claims deliveries can be completed in as little as two to three minutes once a drone takes flight. You can track the drone's progress from the app (which will only be available on Android at launch) and head outside once it's getting close. The drone never fully lowers itself to ground level, but rather hovers overhead and lowers its textbook delivery with the tap of a button on your smartphone. Watch: Flirtey Zookal flies .

ffc37e071dfb217201b16c2f9c03a5f280b58c5d,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The star of the show did not appear -- and the film in question was not shown -- but Hillary Clinton's big-screen moment was all the talk Tuesday at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is tackling a First Amendment case involving a movie about Hillary Clinton. The justices heard arguments in a free-speech case over a 2008 documentary, shown in theaters, that was sharply critical of the onetime presidential candidate and current secretary of state. At issue was whether the 90-minute ""Hillary: The Movie"" and television ads to promote it should have been subject to strict campaign finance laws on political advocacy or should have been seen as a constitutionally protected form of commercial speech. The high court's decision will determine whether politically charged documentaries can be regulated by the government in the same way as traditional campaign commercials. A ruling is expect by late June. A conservative group behind the movie wanted to promote it during the heat of the presidential primary season last year, but a federal court had blocked any ads, as well as airings on cable TV video-on-demand. The film later aired in several theaters and was released on DVD, outlets that were not subject to federal regulation. The Supreme Court justices appeared divided on how to find balance between Congress' expressed desire to control the power of well-financed private groups to spread their political messages and concerns over the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. ""This is targeted at a specific candidate for a specific office to be shown on a channel that says 'Election '08',"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""Now if that isn't an appeal to voters, I can't imagine what is."" ""There's a possibility,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia, ""that the First Amendment interest is greater when what the government is trying to stifle is not just a speaker who wants to say something, but also a listener who wants to hear what the speaker has to say,"" noting that viewers would have paid to see the film on cable television. On its Web site, Citizens United promoted its film as featuring 40 interviews.as well as a ""cast to end all casts."" It promised, ""If you want to hear about the Clinton scandals of the past and present, you have it here! 'Hillary: The Movie' is the first and last word in what the Clintons want America to forget!"" The group, a Washington-based nonprofit corporation and advocacy organization, had balked at campaign finance rules that would have required them to disclose their financial backers and would have restricted when the film could air. The film was partially financed with corporate funds. A three-judge U.S. District Court panel last spring rejected the group's arguments that the documentary was more akin to news or information programs such as PBS' ""Nova"" or CBS' ""60 Minutes."" During Tuesday's oral arguments, the justices seemed uneasy about arguments from both sides. ""This sounds to me like campaign advocacy,"" said Justice David Souter. But attorney Theodore Olson, representing Citizens United, said the law ""smothered"" free speech. He said groups like General Electric (which owns NBC News), National Public Radio and progressive financier George Soros (who often privately funds his political projects) could air such films in the name of informing the American people, but not his clients because of the film's perceived negative tone. ""If it's all negative it can be prohibited, and it's a felony. Or if it's all favorable, you can go to jail. But if you did half and half, you couldn't"" be convicted, said Olson, criticizing the law's ""incomprehensible"" regulations. Several on the court wondered whether a 90-minute message was different than a 30-second commercial. ""It seems to me you can make the argument that 90 minutes is much more powerful in support or in opposition to a candidate,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""We have no choice, really, but to say this is not issue advocacy, this is express advocacy saying don't vote for this person,"" which is subject to regulation,"" Souter said. ""The difference between 90 minutes and one minute is a distinction that I just can't follow."" The comprehensive 2002 McCain-Feingold law bans broadcast of ""electioneering communication"" by corporations, unions and advocacy groups if it would be aired close to election dates and would identify candidates by name or image. The law also requires an on-screen notice of the groups financing such ads, as well as public disclosure of all donors to the sponsoring organizations. Lawyers representing the Federal Election Commission urged the justices to subject the ads to the disclosure law, arguing that without it, voters would be ""unable to know who's funding the ads."" Justice Department attorney Malcolm Stewart called it ""an easy case."" Some on the bench were not sure, probing the limits of the definition of candidate advocacy. ""So if Wal-Mart airs an advertisement that says we have candidate action figures for sale, come buy them, that counts as an electioneering communication,"" asked Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice Samuel Alito wondered about the differences between broadcast or cable TV, where the film could not be run, and the Internet or theaters where it could. When Stewart implied ""additional media"" could also be subject to future regulation, the newest justice replied, ""That's pretty incredible. You think that if a book was published, a campaign biography that was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, that could be banned?"" Most book publishers are corporations subject to campaign finance restrictions, he noted. Legal observers say Alito and Roberts' votes could be key to the case's outcome. At the time of the movie's premiere, Clinton was locked in a tough primary fight with then-Sen. Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination for president. Critics slammed her qualifications and character. People say, ""Well, she's flipping, she's flopping. No, she's not flipping and flopping, she's lying,"" Bay Buchanan, a political commentator and regular analyst for CNN, said in the film. ""We must never understate her chances of winning,"" warned Dick Morris, a former political adviser to President Clinton. ""And we must never forget the fundamental danger that this woman poses to every value that we hold dear. You see, I know her."" Ads for the movie were available on the Internet, which is not subject to federal regulation. ""I've seen this movie,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wryly noted, ""It's not a musical comedy."" David Bossie, head of Citizens United and producer of the ""Hillary"" film, was also behind several conservative documentaries, including a rebuttal to Michael Moore's anti-Bush film ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""

Before they boarded the plane, however, the couple attended a farewell supper with their hosts: Japan's Emperor Akhito and Empress Michiko. Ever the style queen, Maxima pulled out all the stops for her final night on Japanese soil, turning out to meet the Japanese couple in a striking silver grey dress and a sparkling diamond brooch.

Striking though Maxima's wardrobe is, the Dutch couple's visit was almost eclipsed by the unexpected appearance of Crown Princess Masako, who made her first public appearance for 11 years during a state dinner held in their honour. Masako, who was accompanied by her husband Crown Prince Naruhito for the event, had last appeared in public at a state dinner for the president of Mexico in 2003. Since then, the 50-year-old has lived largely as a recluse, after succumbing to a stress-related illness after giving birth to her daughter, Aiko, now 12.

Final meeting: The Dutch royal couple have now boarded a plane bound for the Netherlands . Lovely: Queen Maxima was stylish in green for yesterday's investment development meeting . Japan boasts the oldest continual hereditary monarchy in the world, beginning with Emperor Jimmu who reigned from 660 BC. Since then, 125 emperors have come and gone, with the most recent, Hirohito, famous for being head of state during the Second World War. Unlike other members of the Japanese administration, he was not charged with war crimes and instead oversaw Japan's rebirth as a constitutional monarchy - a process continued by his son, Akhito. Maxima, who is the mother of three young children, has had no such problems and certainly appeared to enjoy the visit to Japan, which began on Wednesday. The three-day visit, which was designed to boost trade between Japan and the Netherlands, saw the royal couple take in a design museum, before taking part in an investment development meeting alongside Dutch officials. Unlike their Japanese counterparts, who have sat on the Chrysanthemum Throne since 1990 following the death of Emperor Hirohito, the Dutch royals are among the newest - and youngest - monarchs in the world. Willem-Alexander, 47, was one of the beneficiaries of a spate of abdications in 2013 which saw his mother Queen Beatrix step down along with King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI. Only Philippe and Mathilde of Belgium and Felipe and Letizia of Spain have been on the throne for a shorter period of time, with the latter two crowned in June following the abdication of Juan-Carlos. But while Letizia and Felipe's reign has so far gone smoothly, Maxima and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the MH17 tragedy, which left the Netherlands reeling. Nevertheless, since the crash, the popularity of the Argentina-born Dutch Queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the MH17 families. She has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside Prime Minister Mark Rutte as the first flight arrived back on Dutch soil. Interesting stuff: The couple also visited Tokyo University, where they were met by President Junichi Hamada .

More recently, the Dutch royals have found themselves cheered to the rafters during public appearances, most notably when they appeared on the balcony of the Noordeinde Palace in the Hague on Prinsjesdag [Prince's Day], along with the former Queen Beatrix, 76 . Maxima, 43, has also become a familiar sight at charity events around the Netherlands, with her most recent outing being at a symposium organised by women's rights activists in Amsterdam, which celebrated the 40th birthday of a Dutch law banning domestic violence. With her husband, she also enjoyed a successful trip to New York last month, where she was seen chatting with fellow queen Letizia during a meeting of the UN General Assembly. The pair were reiunited for the second time in a month two weeks ago, when the Spanish royals paid their Dutch counterparts a friendly visit in The Hague.

Out-of-hours GPs are being left to care on their own for up to half a million patients. Cost-cutting NHS chiefs are routinely assigning just one family doctor to districts that stretch over hundreds of square miles. A third of primary care trusts, which manage GP services, have slashed night and weekend spending over the past 12 months. On call: A third of primary care trusts, which manage GP services, have cut night and weekend spending (file) In Cornwall, some nights have seen one GP looking after 535,000 patients. In Mid Essex just one doctor is in charge of 370,000 between 7pm and 8am. And after axing one of its two doctors, North East Essex has the same cover for the 325,000 patients on its books. Stuart Gray, a GP whose father was killed in 2008 by an incompetent locum doctor, said: ‘I am appalled but not surprised. ‘It would appear some trusts really don’t care about patient safety or put it high on their agenda. I fear many PCT managers are driven by their desire to balance the books. This is morally repugnant. ‘Patients are still put at unacceptable risk by apparently negligent practices.’ The standard of out-of-hours care has been under scrutiny since 2004 when a new contract enabled GPs to opt out of evening and weekend duties. Now only one in four works out of hours. 'Appalled but not surprised': Stuart Gray, a GP whose father was killed by an incompetent locum doctor . Many trusts have since outsourced the cover to private firms who hire locum – or temporary – doctors to fill the shifts. Trusts have been found to be employing doctors from overseas without checking they have the necessary skills or can even speak English. 'I fear many PCT managers are driven by their desire to balance the books. This is morally repugnant' Stuart Gray, GP whose father was killed by incompetent locum doctor . In 2008, Dr Gray’s pensioner father David, from Cambridgeshire, died after a German doctor, Daniel Ubani, gave him ten times the recommended dose of a painkiller. It later emerged Ubani had been hired by Take Care Now, a private firm which had not carried out any checks on him. Using the Freedom of Information Act, the Mail asked every PCT in England a series of questions about out-of-hours cover. Of the 90 that responded, 35 had slashed their out-of-hours budgets in the past year. The average cut was 10 per cent. Coverage: 11 trusts employed only one doctor at night to cover between 180,000 and 535,000 patients (file) And 11 trusts employed only one doctor at night to cover between 180,000 and 535,000 patients. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of The Patients Association, said: ‘These stark figures confirm what patients are telling us - it is incredibly difficult to get access to a GP out of hours either to talk by phone or to arrange a home visit.’ A spokesman from Serco, the private firm which runs out-of-hours cover in Cornwall, said there had been a ‘limited’ number of occasions in the past year when just one GP was on call. 'It is incredibly difficult to get access to a GP out of hours either to talk by phone or to arrange a home visit' Katherine Murphy, chief executive of The Patients Association . He said Serco now ensured there were at least two GPs on call at night to cover all of the county’s 1,316 square miles. In addition at least five nurses and paramedics are on duty in cars. Surgeries should provide a separate out-of-hours number and patients can also call NHS Direct. GPs now have to provide care between 8am and 6.30pm only. Usually locums are based at an out-of-hours clinic for the duration of the night and will only make a handful of home visits to more serious cases. A Department of Health spokesman said local NHS groups were obliged to ensure high quality care was in place and should take action over any failings.","A third of primary care trusts have slashed night and weekend spending .

Barack Obama mentioned Ann Nixon Cooper on Tuesday in his presidential victory speech. Ann Nixon Cooper, 106 years old, lived during a time when blacks and women did not have the right to vote. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Ann Nixon Cooper, 106 years old, has seen presidents come and go in her lifetime and has outlived most of them. On a sunny fall morning, she left her weathered but well-kept Tudor home in Atlanta, Georgia, to vote early -- this time for Barack Obama. The African-American centenarian remembers a time not long ago when she was barred from voting because of her race. Now she hopes to see the day that Obama is elected as the nation's first black president. ""I ain't got time to die,"" Cooper said with a smile. ""Even if he didn't win, I was happy for him just to be nominated,"" said the former socialite. ""The first black president -- isn't that something, at 106 years old?""  Watch Obama say 'Yes we can' » . At the Fulton County government center, Cooper was greeted by Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin. ""I thought that I would accompany her today to support her, but also to say to all people that this is a choice we have,"" Franklin said. ""As all Americans, we should cherish the right to vote and take every opportunity we have to vote our opinions. She is an inspiration to me personally, but she is also quite an inspiration to all Atlanta.""   Watch Cooper talk about her life and experiences » . Cooper, in a wheelchair and helped by two caretakers, bypassed the long lines of early voters and headed right to the voting machine. Her 106-year-old hands reached out to the 21st-century touch screen to cast her vote for Obama. Back at her home, surrounded by the elegance of a bygone era, Cooper clutched the photo albums laid out on her dining room table. The longtime socialite and community leader has called Atlanta home since the 1920s.  See images of Cooper's day » . She and her late husband, prominent dentist Dr. Albert Cooper, raised four children in this house. ""Our days and nights were just social affairs,"" she said. The home was a center of Atlanta's black society and the scene of many parties. Celebrities, including the late singer Nat King Cole, dropped in to visit. ""It's been a house with a heap of living going on in it,"" said Cooper. She wears a charm bracelet that former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young gave her when she turned 99. ""He adds a charm every year,"" said friend and caretaker Sally Warner. ""Andy says he will have to apply for a loan soon to keep up with Mrs. Cooper."" Cooper danced the electric slide up until the age of 103. She has recently slowed down after suffering several heart attacks and a fractured hip. On a typical day, Cooper spends hours watching television in her wood-paneled sitting room. ""Her favorite show is 'The Price is Right,' although she is getting used to Drew Carey as the new host,"" said Warner. Other favorite shows include ""Oprah"" and ""Dancing with the Stars."" When the weather is nice, Cooper spends afternoons on her screened porch, watching traffic go by and reminiscing about old times. Occasionally she leaves the house for an outing. Cooper was born in Shelbyville, Tennessee, in 1902. She grew up in Nashville with uncles and an aunt who worked as a domestic for wealthy whites. She married Albert Cooper in Nashville in 1922, and the couple moved to Atlanta. Three of Cooper's four children have died; her surviving daughter is 83. She has 14 grandchildren living and many great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren. When asked about the secret to her longevity, Cooper said, ""I don't know how it happened, but being cheerful had a lot to do with it.

A Naomi Campbell lookalike who was bullied at school for being 'too tall and nerdy' says she can't walk down the road without being pestered for autographs. Lystra Adams was constantly teased while at school in Montserrat for being taller than everyone else in her school and looking like a geek. The name calling and snide whispering was so vicious that the young Lystra used to suffer panic attacks before going to class. Lystra now works as a lookalike for the supermodel and is regularly stopped for autographs in the street . Naomi, pictured here working as a professional model, is often hired to attend events and treated like a star . Lystra, pictured age 16, was constantly teased while at school in Montserrat for being taller than everyone else in her school and looking like a geek . Now the 37-year-old stunner has conquered the bullies and has carved out a successful career in modelling and being the supermodel's lookalike. Striking Lystra said: 'I was constantly bullied at school - I was always tall and used to tower above most of the older boys, let alone girls my age, and I worse these thick glasses. 'This one girl - who thought she was a top dog - was always calling me names like 'freak' and 'nerd' and she used to lead everyone in whispering behind my back. 'It doesn't sound much, but when you're younger and just want to fit in the constant whispering and teasing caused me to have panic attacks every day before school. 'It was horrible and really knocked my confidence at the time but looking back it has made me a stronger person - all I think now is look at me now!' Astonishingly when Lystra arrived from Montserrat in 1997 - the height of the supermodel's catwalk fame - she had no idea who Naomi Campbell was. At school the name calling and snide whispering was so vicious that the young Lystra used to suffer panic attacks before going to class . Lystra says that being compared to the supermodel and being able to work as her lookalike has hugely boosted her confidence . The then 20-year-old, originally from Guyana, found herself in Halifax, Yorkshire - a far cry from the runways of Paris, Milan and New York - but was still stared at in the street. Lystra, who now lives in Staffordshire, joked: 'When all these people stared at me I thought there was something wrong with me! 'I had no clue until one day, about a year after I'd arrived, this woman came up to me and told me I looked like Naomi Campbell. 'I just said ""Who?!"" but when I looked it up I was flattered and started doing lookalike work. 'I signed up with the Model Bank modelling agency in Birmingham, and I have been in work ever since. 'She's been a bit less of a diva recently though - I need her to throw some more phones so the calls start coming back in!' For the last 15 years she has been turning up at functions and events in stretch limos and being 'papped' on the red carpet. She laughs when describing one event where she was surrounded by bodyguards, who took their role so seriously they even followed her into the toilet. Lystra says that despite mixed reactions from people, she loves looking like the model and feels she has now beaten her school bullies . As the supermodel - the first black model to appear on the cover of French Vogue in 1988 - has calmed down and shied away from the press, lookalike work has slowed for Lystra. However she is still stopped in the street wherever she goes - even if she is just out shopping with her partner and her daughter Jasmine, 13. Lystra said: 'Still there isn't a day goes by where I'm not told I look like her - if I had a pound for every time that happened I'd have as much money as her! 'Whenever we go on holiday I'm always stopped for autographs - it probably doesn't help that I'm wearing sunglasses which makes me look more of a diva! 'I had one woman stop me in the airport and ask for my autograph for her daughter as she was a big fan - even after I told her I wasn't Naomi. 'On the other hand, another woman shouted at me at the races the other day because she didn't believe I wasn't Naomi and said I was lying and being a bitch and a diva! 'Sometimes I just can't win, but I try not to complain - there are worse people to look like!'","Lystra grew up on Caribbean island of Montserrat .

ffc4587ebe88c7f5c70e261aa5ca068377b18259,"(CNN) -- Fifty-two superheroes are getting a makeover, and comic book fans can't stop talking about it -- even though they've seen this sort of thing before. DC Comics announced Tuesday on its blog, and in exclusive interviews with USA Today, that come September, not only will many of its titles get a more modern look under respected artist Jim Lee's direction, but they'll also get renumbered, starting issue counts back at No. 1. (DC Comics, like CNN, is owned by parent company Time Warner.) For readers emotionally invested in the stories of superheroes like Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, this kind of announcement can be threatening. Based on fans' Twitter reaction, it's obvious that anxiety, or at the very least skepticism, has set in. ""I've seen their attempts to revamp before,"" said David Whitehead, a 39-year-old client performance strategist who has been collecting comic books for 20 years. ""So, I guess I'm going in with some guarded skepticism,"" he said. He wonders what kind of stories DC has up its sleeve, and how interesting they could be. He hopes the iconic publisher can pull it off, he said. ""I was the biggest Jim Lee fan in the '90s, and then after seeing what he did to the Wonder Woman costume, I'm a little hesitant to see what he's done with the rest of the Justice League and the rest of the DC Universe,"" Whitehead said. Fans also know that any kind of reboot is, in part, a business decision for the comic book publisher. ""What they're shooting for is the opportunity for readers to jump on at an issue No. 1,"" said Kathleen Saracen, manager of Titan Games and Comics in Smyrna, Georgia. ""New readers feel like, 'Oh, it's a No. 1, I could start reading it now,'"" she said. Comic book sales often jump up with a No. 1 issue, she said, ""but I think it gets tiresome, from a collector's point of view, to constantly have to renumber your collection."" With comic books, she explained, many titles order story lines by volumes. At the beginning of a new volume, the issue number of a comic book may or may not roll back to No. 1. So for hard-core, superorganized collectors who have been following one comic book for a long time, she said, the chronological order of their copies isn't always so logical. And renumbering hasn't always been appreciated in the past. ""One book that comes to mind is Wonder Woman,"" said Erika Peterman, a DC Comics fan and blogger for girls-gone-geek.com. The Wonder Woman comic book was relaunched by DC in 2006, and by last year the new volume had reached issue No. 44. After a fan write-in campaign, DC revised the issue numbers to reflect the original starting date of the title, resulting in the next issue being numbered 600. ""Fans were like, 'Yes! (Wonder Woman) deserves that high number because she's been around since the 1940s, this puts her right up there with Superman and Batman,'"" said Peterman. Despite all the apprehension, fans say they want DC to be successful in this latest endeavor. They know that more people reading comic books means they get to keep collecting. So even if DC's across-the-board revamp isn't engineered to please loyal fans, it's a move that they understand -- because it's designed to bring new readers into the fold. For the most part, said Peterman, comic book collectors are in their mid-30s, which may surprise outsiders who think comic books are juvenile. Younger people are not collecting comic books the way they were 20 years ago, she said. Whitehead points out that comic books aren't generally available at the corner store anymore, so the impulse buys he made at the drug store in his youth are less likely to happen. These days, comic books are sold almost exclusively in comic book stores. That's where the second part of DC's announcement comes in: With the renumbering, they'll be offering day-and-date digital. That means that the same day new issues of comic books are in stores, they'll be available for download as well. Whitehead said he thinks younger readers are more likely to read comics electronically. ""We're having a party,"" said DC Executive Editor Eddie Berganza. ""We want as many people coming to that party as possible. If day-and-date digital is a way to get more people involved in comics and see what we're doing, I think that's great."" ""It seems to be the way the whole world is going,"" he said. In addition to the announcement Tuesday that the comic book ""Justice League"" would be starting again at issue No. 1 in September, DC officials told CNN the publisher would also be renumbering and modernizing such titles as Wonder Woman, Aquaman, The Flash, The Fury of Firestorm, The Savage Hawkman, Green Arrow, Justice League International, Mister Terrific, Captain Atom and DC Universe Presents. The characters brought to the fore with the reboot will be interacting in ways they never have before in the DC universe, said DC Editor-in-Chief Bob Harras. ""For me, I wanted to get into the Cyborg character, who will be part of the Justice League,"" Berganza said. ""He's always been one of my favorites from the Titans and now to see him step up, really take his place among the bigger pantheon of heroes is excellent. He's such a cool character."" ""We're doing a book called 'Savage Hawkman' and to see the excitement between the artist (Philip Tan) and the writer (Tony Daniel), taking a classic DC character, and to see what they're doing with it is so amazing,"" said Harras of the energy he sees in the pages of the rebooted title. ""It's an epic that we're putting together, and we're incredibly excited about it,"" he said. Even so, fans still have unanswered questions about the upcoming reboot. As DC continues to announce its 52 superhero titles getting the treatment, fans can't help but wonder what will change. For example, after giving Wonder Woman pants, what will Lee do to modernize DC's other heavy hitters, Batman and Superman? DC wouldn't tell CNN. Guess we'll have to wait and see.","DC Comics will be renumbering 52 of its superhero titles in September .

The Uruguay star is in South America preparing for the Confederations Cup and Liverpool have insisted he is not for sale. But Suarez, who is serving a 10-game domestic ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic, has again railed against his treatment from the media.

'They have never spoken well of me. For that reason, when I was told I could win the Player of the Year award, I said, ""I will not get excited as I know that I will never win an important award in England"".' Suarez also feels the FA are against him, comparing his ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra with that of John Terry, who was suspended for half the amount of games after a similar incident with Anton Ferdinand. Suarez suggested the fact he is South American counted against him. Never given a chance: Suarez says he has been portrayed in a negative way by the media . 'Without any proof they gave me an eight-match ban, but with Terry, where they had proof, lip-readers, they gave him four. I'm South American and I think that's the root of all of this,' he added. 'Liverpool is a club that I dreamt about playing for as a boy. I have been with great players there, they know me and I would love to continue for many more years at Liverpool. The stadium is spectacular, the fans are phenomenal: people with tattoos of me, things that I could never have imagined. 'After the [Evra] suspension people would come up to me, this is something that really touched me and they would say, ""Luis forget everything and stay."" 'But I can't forget as it was something that I had to suffer, that my family had to suffer and away from football I have a family to support and who are hurt by these things.' Biting point: Luis Suarez sinks his teeth into Branislav Ivanovic's arm . Unfair: Suarez says his ban for racism against Patrice Evra was too harsh . Asked again where he sees himself going, should he leave he said: 'My agent said to remain calm rather than quiet, remain calm and when there is concrete interest you'll be the first to know.' Suarez also recounted a recent incident during a shopping trip, which affected him and his family. 'About a week ago I was walking in a shopping centre near Manchester and three or four guys asked me for a photo,' he revealed. 'While we were posing for it my wife said to me, ""Luis, get out of the photo"". She noticed they were making biting gestures. I was with my wife and my daughter. Things like that get on your nerves. My wife was on the brink of tears and the blokes ran off laughing. You get tired of stuff like that.' Is this the end? Suarez says he loves Liverpool but has to leave . Suarez has already said he would be open to a move to Real Madrid and added: 'I'm not sure if I see myself in the white (of Real Madrid), the only thing I know is that I have a contract,' he said. 'Any player would like to play for a great team and Real Madrid certainly are that. 'Every player wants to reach the very top and Real Madrid are at the very top, but everything that has been said is just rumours, I have had nothing concrete. 'Obviously Real Madrid is a great team . and every player dreams about them; Real Madrid is Real Madrid and it's . as high as you can go as a player and they will always tempt you.' The good and the bad: Suarez scored plenty of goals and was a favourite among Liverpool fans - but he drew criticism for his diving (below) Suarez says he and compatriot Edinson Cavani don't speak about their respective futures, with the Napoli striker also the subject of transfer interest. 'We have never really spoken about whether this club or that is interested. Obviously we talk about football; he asks me about the Premier League and I ask him about Italy,' he said. 'But we have never talked or even even joked about one of us going to one club or another. 'I would prefer to have him as a team-mate than a rival because he is a great player. Hopefully he will go to one of the four you dream of because he has great power.'","Accuses the media of only focusing on the bad aspects of his game .

ffc57b984cdc2184da5db9266a80a13c0dc1b6eb,"The U.S. government agreed to a police request to restrict more than 37 square miles of airspace surrounding Ferguson, Missouri, for 12 days in August for safety, but audio recordings show that local authorities privately acknowledged the purpose was to keep away news helicopters during violent street protests. On Aug. 12, the morning after the Federal Aviation Administration imposed the first flight restriction, FAA air traffic managers struggled to redefine the flight ban to let commercial flights operate at nearby Lambert-St. Louis International Airport and police helicopters fly through the area - but ban others. 'They finally admitted it really was to keep the media out,' said one FAA manager about the St. Louis County Police in a series of recorded telephone conversations obtained by The Associated Press. 'But they were a little concerned of, obviously, anything else that could be going on.' Scroll down for video . Shut out: The audio recordings  raise questions about whether police were trying to suppress aerial images of the Ferguson demonstrations and the police response by violating the constitutional rights of journalists . Victim: Protests erupted after Michael Brown, pictured, was shot in an altercation with Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson . At another point, a manager at the FAA's Kansas City center said police 'did not care if you ran commercial traffic through this TFR (temporary flight restriction) all day long. They didn't want media in there.' FAA procedures for defining a no-fly area did not have an option that would accommodate that. 'There is really ... no option for a TFR that says, you know, ""OK, everybody but the media is OK,""' he said. The managers then worked out wording they felt would keep news helicopters out of the controlled zone but not impede other air traffic. The conversations contradict claims by the St. Louis County Police Department, which responded to demonstrations following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown, that the restriction was solely for safety and had nothing to do with preventing media from witnessing the violence or the police response. Police said at the time, and again as recently as late Friday to the AP, that they requested the flight restriction in response to shots fired at a police helicopter. But police officials confirmed there was no damage to their helicopter and were unable to provide an incident report on the shooting. On the tapes, an FAA manager described the helicopter shooting as unconfirmed 'rumors.' The AP obtained the recordings under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. They raise serious questions about whether police were trying to suppress aerial images of the demonstrations and the police response by violating the constitutional rights of journalists with tacit assistance by federal officials. Officer: Charges have so far not been filed against Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown . Blocked: Audio recordings show that local authorities privately acknowledged the purpose of the no-fly zone was to keep away news helicopters during violent street protests . Such images would have offered an unvarnished view of one of the most serious episodes of civil violence in recent memory. 'Any evidence that a no-fly zone was put in place as a pretext to exclude the media from covering events in Ferguson is extraordinarily troubling and a blatant violation of the press's First Amendment rights,' said Lee Rowland, an American Civil Liberties Union staff attorney specializing in First Amendment issues. An FAA manager urged modifying the flight restriction so that planes landing at Lambert still could enter the airspace around Ferguson. The less-restrictive change practically served the authorities' intended goal, an FAA official said: 'A lot of the time the (lesser restriction) just keeps the press out, anyways. They don't understand the difference. The Kansas City FAA manager then asked a St. Louis County police official if the restrictions could be lessened so nearby commercial flights wouldn't be affected. The new order allows 'aircraft on final (approach) there at St. Louis. It will still keep news people out. ... The only way people will get in there is if they give them permission in there anyway so they, with the (lesser restriction), it still keeps all of them out.' 'Yeah,' replied the police official. 'I have no problem with that whatsoever.' KMOV-TV News Director Brian Thouvenot told the AP that his station was prepared at first to legally challenge the flight restrictions, but was later advised that its pilot could fly over the area as long as the helicopter stayed above 3,000 feet. That kept the helicopter and its mounted camera outside the restricted zone, although filming from such a distance, he said, was 'less than ideal.' None of the St. Louis stations was advised that media helicopters could enter the airspace even under the lesser restrictions, which under federal rules should not have applied to aircraft 'carrying properly accredited news representatives.' The FAA's no-fly notice indicated the area was closed to all aircraft except police and planes coming to and from the airport. Issues: Ferguson police were widely criticized for their response following the death of Brown, who was shot by Wilson on August 9 . Aerial images of what was happening in Ferguson would have offered an unvarnished view of one of the most serious episodes of civil violence in recent memory . 'Only relief aircraft operations under direction of St. Louis County Police Department are authorized in the airspace,' it said. 'Aircraft landing and departing St. Louis Lambert Airport are exempt.' The same day that notice was issued, a county police spokesman publicly denied the no-fly zone was to prevent news helicopters from covering the events. 'We understand that that's the perception that's out there, but it truly is for the safety of pilots,' Sgt. Brian Schellman told NBC News. Ferguson police were widely criticized for their response following the death of Brown, who was shot by a city police officer, Darren Wilson, on Aug. 9. Later, under county police command, several reporters were arrested, a TV news crew was tear gassed and some demonstrators were told they weren't allowed to film officers. In early October, a federal judge said the police violated demonstrators' and news crews' constitutional rights. A police captain wanted the no-fly zone extended when officials were set to identify Wilson by name as the officer who shot Brown and because Brown's funeral would 'bring out the emotions,' the recordings show . 'Here in the United States of America, police should not be bullying and arresting reporters who are just doing their jobs,' President Barack Obama said Aug. 14, two days after police confided to federal officials the flight ban was secretly intended to keep media helicopters out of the area. 'The local authorities, including police, have a responsibility to be transparent and open.' The restricted flight zone initially encompassed airspace in a 3.4-mile radius around Ferguson and up to 5,000 feet in altitude, but police agreed to reduce it to 3,000 feet after the FAA's command center in Warrenton, Virginia, complained to managers in Kansas City that it was impeding traffic into St. Louis. The flight restrictions remained in place until Aug. 22, FAA records show. A police captain wanted it extended when officials were set to identify Wilson by name as the officer who shot Brown and because Brown's funeral would 'bring out the emotions,' the recordings show. 'We just don't know what to expect,' he told the FAA. 'We're monitoring that. So, last night we shot a lot of tear gas, we had a lot of shots fired into the air again. It did quiet down after midnight, but with that ... we don't know when that's going to erupt.' The recordings do not capture early conversations about the initial flight restriction imposed a day earlier, but they nonetheless show the FAA still approved and modified the flight restriction after the FAA was aware that its main intent was to keep the media away. One FAA official at the agency's command center asked the Kansas City manager in charge whether the restrictions were really about safety. 'So are (the police) protecting aircraft from small-arms fire or something?' he asked. 'Or do they think they're just going to keep the press out of there, which they can't do.'","The U.S. government agreed to a police request to restrict more than 37 square miles of airspace surrounding Ferguson, Missouri, for 12 days .

The hunter, who was not named by authorities, told Utah . wildlife officers on Sunday that he accidentally shot and killed . a wolf equipped with a radio collar near the Arizona border . after mistaking it for a coyote. Wolves in Utah are protected under the U.S. Endangered . Species Act, which bans killing of imperiled animals without a . special permit, but coyotes in the state are allowed to be shot . on sight. The Arizona Game and Fish Department released this photo in October of the gray wolf that was spotted at the Grand Canyon - the first sighting of the species in more than 70 years there. It is believed that a gray wolf killed on Sunday in Utah may be the same creature, named Echo . Wandering lone wolf: The three-year-old female's epic journey from the Rockies to the Grand Canyon sadly came to an end on Sunday when she was shot dead by a hunter in Utah . The incident, which is coming under sharp criticism by . conservationists, is being investigated by federal and state . conservation officers as a possible violation of U.S. and Utah . wildlife laws, authorities said. Information gleaned from the radio collar shows the wolf . killed in Utah was a three-year-old female that was captured and . collared in January in northwest Wyoming, said Utah Division of . Wildlife Resources spokesman Mark Martinez. The wolf spotted near the northern rim of the Grand Canyon . in October was also a young female, which had apparently roamed . hundreds of miles south from the Northern Rockies, . according to an analysis of droppings near where she was seen. It may be weeks before additional testing reveals whether . the wolf killed in Utah is the same one, which was nicknamed . Echo in a contest. Echo was the first gray wolf seen in the Grand Canyon and the adjacent national forest since . the 1940s, when the last wolf there was killed as part of an . extensive eradication campaign, said Chris Cline with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. It also marked the species'  farthest journey south. Wolves often roam vast distances in search of food and mates. But the farther they go, the less likely they are to find a mate, said Ed Bangs, who led recovery efforts for wolves in the Northern Rockies over two decades before retiring from the Fish and Wildlife Service in 2011. 'It's looking for love,' he said in October. 'It leaves the core population and doesn't know the love of its life is going to be right over the next hill, so it just keeps traveling.' Analysis of the animal's scat while it was in Arizona in October showed it had traveled hundreds of miles from the Northern Rockies in Wyoming . The gray wolf is protected under the U.S. Endangered Species . Act in most states. About 25 per cent of the roughly 1,700 wolves from the Northern Rockies are being tracked, wildlife officials said. They are distinguished from the Mexican gray wolves found in the Southwest by their more full bodies and less pointed ears. Utah regulations require hunters to properly identify their . target before shooting but cases of mistaken identity sometimes . happen, Martinez said. 'It's something we train people for in hunter education . classes but it's not a unique thing,' he said. The hunter who shot the wolf near the city of Beaver in . southwest Utah immediately contacted the state to report the . incident as required by law, Martinez said. He said several . coyotes in Utah have been equipped with radio collars tied to a . research project. Wildlife advocates said the death was shameful, whether or . not the wolf was Echo.

Manchester United slipped up to Swansea while Arsenal were poor in their win against Crystal Palace, so their are several lesser-known gems in this team. Formation: 4-4-1-1 . GK: Hugo Lloris, Tottenham (vs West Ham), 8 . Matt Barlow at Upton Park . Hugo Lloris was inspired in the Spurs goal, making two brilliant second-half saves to deny Stewart Downing, the second shortly before Eric Dier’s winner. RB: Eric Dier, Tottenham (vs West Ham), 7 . Matt Barlow at Upton Park . A clean sheet as part of a 10-man team at Upton Park would have been enough for young debutant Eric Dier, but he also had the audacity to score the winner. The youngster, who started at the heart of defence, stormed forward from right-back to net the only goal in added time. Match winner: Young debutant Eric Dier scored the winner as Tottenham beat West Ham on Saturday . CB: Ashley Williams, Swansea (vs Manchester United), 7.5 . Adam Crafton at Old Trafford . Ashley Williams was superb in defence at Old Trafford, highlighted in the fact United's only goal came from a set-piece. The Welshman, who signed a contract extension in the summer, looks set to have another stellar season as captain in South Wales. CB: James Chester, Hull (vs QPR) 7.5 . Sami Mokbel at Loftus Road . Nets the winner and helps his team to a clean sheet, it can't get much better than that for a defender. Chester nipped in front of Rio Ferdinand for his goal as Steve Bruce's side got their season up and running. LB: Andrew Robertson, Hull (vs QPR), 8 . Sami Mokbel at Loftus Road . Robertson was a constant thorn in QPR's side down the left-hand side for Hull, bombing foward from wing-back. The Scottish debutant provided many crosses in the 1-0 win, and also cleared Steven Caulker's bullet header off the line. RM: Steven Naismith, Everton (vs Leicester), 7.5 . Rob Harris at the King Power Stadium . Another energetic performance from Naismith, who covered the most amount of ground (7.7 miles), but also showed fine technique for his goal. Volleying home off the bar to put Everton 2-1 up, the winger will be central to Roberto Martinez's plans this season. Great start: Steven Naismith started how he finished last season with a goal against Leicester . CM: Lee Cattermole, Sunderland (vs West Brom), 7.5 . Craig Hope at the Hawthorns . He may have scored just twice in 103 Premier League appearances for Sunderland, but Cattermole netted the goal of the day in the 2-2 draw. Five minutes had passed before the defensive midfielder's shot from long range flew past Ben Foster into the top corner. CM: Craig Gardner, West Brom (vs Sunderland), 7.5 . Craig Hope at the Hawthorns . Gardner excelled against his former club on Saturday. Constant energy in midfield gave Alan Irvine just the platform he was looking for. Supplied Saido Berahino's second goal with a wonderfully floated cross. LM: Gylfi Sigurdsson, Swansea (vs Manchester United), 8 . Adam Crafton at Old Trafford . Not many players can claim to be a match winner at Old Trafford, but Gylfi Sigurdsson capped a fine performance with a neat finish on Saturday. The Icelandic midfielder, in his second spell at the Swans, summoned Van Gaal to an humiliating opening day defeat. Shock: Manchester United's start to the season was ruined by Swansea playmaker Gylfi Sigurdsson . CF: Marouane Chamakh, Crystal Palace (vs Arsenal), 7.5 . Jack Gaughan at the Emirates Stadium . Another man starting against his former club, the Moroccan played in an unfamiliar role on Saturday. Tasked with shutting down midfielders and stopping Arsenal finding their stride, Chamakh covered 7.2 miles at the Emirates Stadium, second behind Aaron Ramsey. ST: Saido Berahino, West Brom (vs Aston Villa), 8 . Craig Hope at the Hawthorns . We have an early frontrunner for the Golden Boot. Berahino was the only man to score more than once on Saturday, netting a penalty and a nice poacher's finish. Just a shame he wasn't the match winner.

ffc604e7c2573377b25d59e3cae87190270a0d18,"By . Julian Robinson . A retired footballer has been ordered to pay a woman more than £2,500 in damages - after she stubbed her toe on a 'keep off the grass' sign outside his house. Former goalkeeper Malcolm White, 73, has also been hit with a £25,000 legal bill after he was successfully sued by Emma Grady. Miss Grady, 40, injured her left toe on a homemade wooden sign the pensioner had put on a grass verge outside his home in South Hykeham, Lincolnshire. Malcolm White, left, has been ordered to pay Emma Grady, right, more than £2,500 in damages after she stubbed her toe on a 'keep off the grass' sign outside his house . Emma Jane Grady made a claim against Malcolm White, after she said that she had tripped over a 'Do not park on the grass' sign that he had placed there. The signs can be seen here placed in the grass, circled in red, but they have since been removed . The sign, which measured 4ins by 10in, read ‘Please do not park on the grass’ and was erected outside hisdetached property. Mr White, who played for Lincoln City, Grimbsy Town and Wolverhampton Wanderers, put it there as a favour for villagers who were fed up with parents parking on the grass verge when they collected their children from the local primary school. But he was taken to court after Miss Grady tore the nail off her left big toe on a rusty nail when she stumbled over the sign as she went to collect her daughter from school on November 12, 2012. Miss Grady, who lives half-a-mile away in the neighbouring village of High Hykeham, claimed it took six months for her toe nail to grow back but has been left deformed. A sign on the grass verge in South Hykeham, Lincolnshire said 'Please do not park on the grass' Mr White, who went on to play in America for Los Angeles Wolves, has been ordered to pay Miss Grady £2,541.35 in damages and £24,874.39 in court costs. He denied erecting the sign but his wife Valerie, 72, admitted he did put it up in a telephone conversation with Miss Grady’s solicitor Katherine Trafford. Passing judgement at Lincoln County Court, District Judge Chris Cooper said: 'This case comes down to whether or not Mr and Mrs White or Mrs Trafford is telling the truth. 'It is clear that the claimant suffered sizable injury after the accident. 'I am satisfied that it happened in the way that she said it did and she stubbed her toe on the offending sign. 'I am also satisfied that the signs caused a public nuisance. 'A pedestrian does not have to look at their feet when going about their business.' Mr White has now been forced to pay the cash from his own pocket because his insurance company will not cover his legal bills. In a statement after the hearing, the couple's solicitor Patrick Tedstone said: 'It’s a sad day for Mal and Val. 'They are leaving the village this week after more than 30 very, very happy years, to be closer to family. 'They are very disappointed with the judgement and with the costs, too, but they will respect the judge’s decision. Malcolm White played youth football for his hometown team Wolverhampton Wanderers before signing for Grimsby Town in the late 1950s. He enjoyed a successful trial with the club and stayed with the club for five years making nearly 70 first-team appearances from 1958 to 1963. He went on to play for Walsall, Lincoln City, Bradford City and Halifax Town before going to America to star for Los Angeles Wolves in the late 1960s. Speaking in 2011, he told how, playing for Grimsby, he once saved a penalty from the legendary Brian Clough - who went on to win two consecutive European Cups as manager of Nottingham Forrest. He said: 'When we were in the Second Division, we were competing with the likes of Sunderland, Newcastle, Chelsea, Leeds and Middlesbrough. 'Against Sunderland, I saved a penalty from Brian Clough in front of 46,000 - mind you, he scored a hat-trick in the same game.' 'They wish everyone in the village well.' A friend added: 'They are gutted. It’s a barmy ruling because the sign was put on the verge to stop parents churning it up with their cars. 'The land is publicly owned but was being turned into a car park by inconsiderate parents. I feel very sorry for them. This should never have gone to court.' Miss Grady said: 'I am relieved this is all over. 'I have been through 18 months of hell. My foot will never be the same again. I am satisfied with the result.'","Malcolm White put sign up next to his home in South Hykeham, Lincolnshire .

ffc69886695ecdffee83bf051b108a20502f1a3b,"Did you ever wonder what happens to your old laptop or cellphone when you throw it away? Chances are some of your old electronic junk will end up in China. According to a recent United Nations report, ""China now appears to be the largest e-waste dumping site in the world."" E-waste, or electronic waste, consists of everything from scrapped TVs, refrigerators and air conditioners to that old desktop computer that may be collecting dust in your closet. Many of these gadgets were initially manufactured in China. Through a strange twist of global economics, much of this electronic junk returns to China to die. ""According to United Nations data, about 70% of electronic waste globally generated ended up in China,"" said Ma Tianjie, a spokesman for the Beijing office of Greenpeace. ""Much of [the e-waste] comes through illegal channels because under United Nations conventions, there is a specific ban on electronic waste being transferred from developed countries like the United States to countries like China and Vietnam."" For the past decade, the southeastern town of Guiyu, nestled in China's main manufacturing zone, has been a major hub for the disposal of e-waste.  Hundreds of thousands of people here have become experts at dismantling the world's electronic junk. On seemingly every street, laborers sit on the pavement outside workshops ripping out the guts of household appliances with hammers and drills. The roads in Guiyu are lined with bundles of plastic, wires, cables and other garbage. Different components are separated based on their value and potential for re-sale. On one street sits a pile of green and gold circuit boards. On another, the metal cases of desktop computers. At times, it looks like workers are reaping some giant plastic harvest, especially when women stand on roadsides raking ankle-deep ""fields"" of plastic chips. In one workshop, men sliced open sacks of these plastic chips, which they then poured into large vats of fluid.  They then used shovels and their bare hands to stir this synthetic stew. ""We sell this plastic to Foxconn,"" one of the workers said, referring to a Taiwanese company that manufactures products for many global electronics companies, including Apple, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. Dirty, dangerous work . This may be one of the world's largest informal recycling operations for electronic waste. In one family-run garage, workers seemed to specialize in sorting plastic from old televisions and cars into different baskets.  ""If this plastic cup has a hole in it, you throw it away,"" said a man who ran the operation, pointing to a pink plastic mug.  ""We take it and re-sell it."" But recycling in Guiyu is dirty, dangerous work. ""When recycling is done properly, it's a good thing for the environment,"" said Ma, the Greenpeace spokesman in Beijing. ""But when recycling is done in primitive ways like we have seen in China with the electronic waste, it is hugely devastating for the local environment."" According to the April 2013 U.N. report ""E-Waste in China,"" Guiyu suffered an ""environmental calamity"" as a result of the wide-scale e-waste disposal industry in the area. Much of the toxic pollution comes from burning circuit boards, plastic and copper wires, or washing them with hydrochloric acid to recover valuable metals like copper and steel. In doing so, workshops contaminate workers and the environment with toxic heavy metals like lead, beryllium and cadmium, while also releasing hydrocarbon ashes into the air, water and soil, the report said. For first-time visitors to Guiyu, the air leaves a burning sensation in the eyes and nostrils. Toxic tech . Studies by the Shantou University Medical College revealed that many children tested in Guiyu had higher than average levels of lead in their blood, which can stunt the development of the brain and central nervous system. Piles of technological scrap had been dumped in a muddy field just outside of town.  There, water buffalo grazed and soaked themselves in ponds surrounded by piles of electronic components with labels like Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Epson and Dell. The enormous animals casually stomped through mounds of sheet glass, which clearly had been removed from video monitors. Flat screen displays often use mercury, a highly toxic metal. ""Releases of mercury can occur during the dismantling of equipment such as flat screen displays,"" wrote Greenpeace, in a report titled ""Toxic Tech.""  ""Incineration or landfilling can also result in releases of mercury to the environment...that can bioaccumulate and biomagnify to high levels in food chains, particularly in fish."" Most of the workers in Guiyu involved in the e-waste business are migrants from destitute regions of China and poorly educated.  Many of them downplayed the potential damage the industry could cause to their health. They asked only to use their family names, to protect their identity. ""Of course it isn't healthy,"" said Lu, a woman who was rapidly sorting plastic shards from devices like computer keyboards, remote controls and even computer mice.  She and her colleagues burned plastic using lighters and blow-torches to identify different kinds of material. ""But there are families that have lived here for generations ... and there is little impact on their health,"" she said. Several migrants said that while the work is tough, it allows them more freedom than working on factory lines where young children are not permitted to enter the premises and working hours are stringent. Used to be worse . Despite the environmental degradation and toxic fumes permeating the air, many in Guiyu said that conditions have improved dramatically over the years. ""I remember in 2007, when I first came here, there was a flood of trash,"" said Wong, a 20-year-old man who ferried bundles of electronic waste around on a motorcycle with a trailer attached to it. ""Before people were washing metals, burning things and it severely damaged people's lungs,"" Wong added.  ""But now, compared to before, the [authorities] have cracked down pretty hard."" But residents who did not work in the e-waste business offered a very different take on the pollution in Guiyu. A group of farmers who had migrated from neighboring Guangxi province to cultivate rice in Guiyu told CNN they did not dare drink the local well water. They claimed if they tried to wash clothes and linens with the water, it turned fabrics yellow. The head of the group, who identified himself as Zhou, had another shocking admission. ""It may not sound nice, but we don't dare eat the rice that we farm because it's planted here with all the pollution,"" Zhou said, pointing at water-logged rice paddy next to him. Asked who did eat the harvested rice, Zhou answered: ""How should I know?  A lot of it is sold off ... they don't dare label the rice from here as 'grown in Guiyu.'  They'll write that its rice from some other place."" Not that surprising considering that the latest food scandal to hit the country earlier this month is cadmium-laced rice. Officials in Guangzhou city, roughly 400 kilometers away from Guiyu, found high rates of cadmium in rice and rice products. According to the city's Food and Drug Administration samples pulled from a local restaurant, food seller and two university canteens showed high levels of cadmium in rice and rice noodles. Officials did not specify how the contaminated rice entered the city's food supply. CNN made several attempts to contact the Guiyu town government.  Government officials refused to comment on the electronic waste issue and hung up the phone. However, it did appear that government efforts to restrict imports of foreign waste are reducing the flow of e-trash here. ""Why are they stopping the garbage from reaching us?"" asked one man who ran a plastic sorting workshop.  ""Of course it's hurting our business,"" he added. Domestic e-waste grows . The Chinese government had some success regulating e-waste disposal with a ""Home Appliance Old for New Rebate Program,"" which was tested from 2009 to 2011. With the help of generous government subsidies, the program collected tens of millions of obsolete home appliances, according to the U.N. Even if Chinese authorities succeed in limiting smuggled supplies of foreign garbage, the U.N. warns that the country is rapidly generating its own supply of e-waste. ""Domestic generation of e-waste has risen rapidly as a result of technological and economic development,"" the U.N. reported.  It cited statistics showing an exponential surge in sales of TV's, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners and computers in China over a 16-year period. To avoid a vicious cycle of pollution, resulting from both the manufacture and disposal of appliances, Greenpeace has lobbied for manufacturers to use fewer toxic chemicals in their products.

The country's National Disaster Office said that 40 bodies had been recovered from the debris and search and rescue officers were at the site on Wednesday to assist with the recovery of others. The landslide happened Tuesday in the Komo area in in the Southern Highlands of Papua New Guinea, near one of the country's major liquified natural gas fields. Bill Yomba, an official at the National Disaster Office said that the agency thought that excavations carried out by Esso Highlands, a division of the oil company ExxonMobil, for a natural gas project could have set off the landslide. ""This is a very huge landslide that covered a 1 kilometer area,"" said Yomba. ""We are still trying to find out the cause but at this stage we believe the gas project run by Esso Highlands Limited was a contributor because they had been digging for limestone in the area.""

A heartbreaking image shows an eight-year-old boy holding a teddy bear for comfort as he arrives at the hospital after losing his parents and baby sister in a horrific car crash . Three people, including a woman and her baby girl, are dead after their car slammed into a tree in Victoria . The father and driver of the car, 39, was trapped in the car for a number of hours but later died in hospital . The 29-year-old mother and her baby girl died at the scene of the crash, which happened about 7.30am on Casterton-Penola Road, near Lake Mundi. The boy arrived in hospital with critical injuries but it has since been revealed he is now in a stable condition, Nine News reported. He is suffering from head and abdominal injuries according to Fairfax Media. His surviving sister escaped the accident with only minor injuries on what was believed to be her birthday. The family are believed to be from Congolese, from Central Africa, but now living in South Australia. Two children, a boy, 8, and a girl, 3,  have been left orphaned by the tragic accident . They arrived in Mount Gambier just 18 months ago, and had returned from a reunion with family in the Congo just hours before the accident, according to The Advertiser. The family reportedly flew to Melbourne early on Sunday morning, immediately attempting the six hour drive home just after they stepped off the plane. The Conglonese community in Mount Gambier held a vigil in memory of the young family on Sunday night, and a woman who works at the son's school spoke on behalf of the family. 'They are absolutely destroyed ... they are just grieving because it was such a sudden accident,' Inna Tucker told The Advertiser.

'They’d already been through so much as refugees, endured so much trauma ... they came here for a better and brighter future and it has ended up like this,' she said. Superintendent Don Downs told the ABC it was a 'tragic collision' and part of a 'horror start' to the year in the area. 'People think they can drive in these back roads and there's not a big risk, but there is a big risk,' he said. 'When you come out to jobs like this it's heart-wrenching. Heart-wrenching on the community and heart-wrenching on the members who attended.' Victoria police say they think the driver may have missed a turn off, and fatigue may have been a factor in the crash.

ffc831e0ce75ea61da3cb1c5483d88f45509157c,"Half of all NHS hospitals have had to temporarily close their maternity units over the past year, shock figures revealed today. The most common reason for closing down the wards was because of a lack of staff or beds. Figures obtained under the freedom of information showed 62 hospital trusts out of 121 respondents temporarily closed units in 2013. Women are being passed from 'pillar to post' when having a baby because of the failure of maternity services, the National Childbirth Trust has claimed . Elizabeth Duff, of the National Childbirth Trust, said: 'This failure of maternity services can mean women get passed from pillar to post when having a baby. This is hugely disruptive to labour.' But Health minister Dr Dan Poulter insisted the units only closed on 'limited occasions'. He said the government had 'increased choice in maternity care' and said there were always going to be times when maternity units would fill up. Dr Poulter said: 'There will always be very limited occasions when a maternity unit cannot safely accept more women into their care and may need to close temporarily. 'Any decisions to redirect women are made by clinicians as part of a carefully managed process.' Dr Poulter said the NHS, which has 162 trusts in England, remains 'one of the safest places in the world to give birth'. But some 12 per cent of the NHS's trusts closed their units at least 10 times in 2013, the figures obtained by the BBC show. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is under pressure from Labour over the growing number of maternity units being closed because of a shortage of beds . Some wards closed their doors to new patients for more than 48 hours until pressures had eased. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust closed its maternity ward 97 times across its two hospitals - the Queen's Medical Centre 48 times and Nottingham City Hospital on 49 occasions. This was followed by Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, with 89 closures across its two hospitals - Leeds General Infirmary, 60 times, and St James's University Hospital, 29 times. The findings come after a poll last year by the Care Quality Commission showed the maternity system in England was under strain. A quarter of women reported being left alone during labour and birth at a time that worried them. There are currently nearly 22,000 midwives in the NHS in England - a rise of more than 1,700 in four years. But the Royal College of Midwives said there is still a shortage of 4,500 because the birth rate is at its highest since the early 1970s. RCM chief executive Cathy Warwick said: 'Birth is unpredictable and sometimes units get a rush of births that is unavoidable and cannot be planned for. 'However, if units are regularly and persistently having to close their doors to women it suggests there is a serious underlying problem.' Labour’s Shadow Health Minister Andrew Gwynne added: 'David Cameron promised three thousand more midwives, but he’s failing to deliver them. 'Across England, too many maternity units are operating without enough staff - unable to keep up with demand - whilst others are facing closure or downgrading. 'Experts have warned the Government on the importance of safe staffing levels, but Ministers continue to ignore the advice. Labour is committed to safe staffing levels based on that expert advice. 'This is yet more proof that you can't trust the Tories with the NHS.' Thousands of women have admitted drinking far more alcohol during pregnancy than the advised four units a week. In the past three years, 2,496 mothers said they had exceeded NHS recommendations – equal to a glass and a half of wine. Four women questioned by hospital staff in Middlesbrough said they had drunk an average 34 units a week – three and a half bottles. Heavy drinking during pregnancy raises the risk of foetal alcohol syndrome, which can leave children physically and mentally disabled. Figures obtained by Sky News via a Freedom of Information request showed around one in 200 pregnant women exceeding the limit. More than half of hospitals could not provide data. Dr Raja Mukherjee, of the national foetal alcohol spectrum disorder clinic at Surrey and Borders NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘This shows a disregard for the effects of alcohol on a developing child.’","62 hospital trusts out of 121 temporarily closed maternity units in 2013 .

ffc857018ebbaa52d22ffac19aff9e0dd1f5c15d,"(CNN) -- The gruesome civil war in Syria has terrorized residents and left world leaders scrambling to stop the carnage that mounts daily. Here are the latest developments in the spiraling 18-month crisis: . On the ground: Explosions, casualties . Fighting and shelling persisted all day Sunday and into Monday morning in Aleppo, with both the regime and the opposition blaming each other for dozens of fatalities. A bomb landed on a kindergarten in Aleppo, leveling a residential block and causing a ""great number"" of casualties, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said Sunday. The opposition activist group described it as a barrel bomb attack, saying regime forces have been dropping barrels full of TNT, nails and fuel onto civilian areas. The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported that warplanes shelled a residential building next to a nursery, causing its collapse and leading to ""dozens of martyrs and casualties."" Syrian state-run media, meanwhile, said Sunday that regime forces had killed numerous ""terrorists"" in Aleppo and freed 30 people who had been ""kidnapped by the armed terrorist groups."" Heart-rending choices in warzone hospital . For over a year, the Syrian government has refused to acknowledge the popular uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's rule and has blamed ""armed terrorist groups"" for fueling the bloodshed. Meanwhile, 27 civilians were killed and another 64 wounded in a car bombing near two hospitals in western Aleppo, the state-run SANA news agency reported, citing Aleppo's Gov. Mohammed Wahid. This blast significantly damaged the two hospitals, a school and other buildings. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed that 27 people had died in the attack around what is known as the Earth area of Aleppo. It was not immediately clear, the opposition group said, whether those killed were civilians or regime forces. The violence was hardly confined to Aleppo, however. Across the country, at least 160 people were killed Sunday, opposition activists said. A quarter of those deaths were in and around the Syrian capital, as well as 22 in Daraa and 22 in Homs -- nine of them killed in a ""massacre"" in Rastan, according to the LCC. The opposition group reported Sunday evening that 19 people on one Damascus street died ""after a mortar shell landed on homes in the area."" Citing a source, state media reported 14 ""terrorists"" were killed in a clash with regime forces in the al-Qusayr countryside. Both SANA and the LCC, on its Facebook page, identified the same three men as being killed in the area -- with the opposition group saying they died after ""a land mine planted by regime forces in a road exploded."" U.N. employee shot dead in Damascus . In the country's capital, a 28-year-old employee of the United Nations' Palestinian refugee agency died Sunday after a bullet struck him in the chest, the agency said. Baby survives as family dies in Syrian onslaught . It was unclear whether his death, which occurred just south of the Yarmouk residential area in Damascus, ""was caused by a stray bullet or one fired by a sniper,"" the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) said in a statement. The death was the second in three days for a U.N employee working around Yarmouk, which the world body said is home to about 1 million Syrians and 150,000 Palestinian refugees. Ten Palestinian refugees were also killed between September 6 and 8 by violence stemming from the broader civil war. Late Sunday night, the opposition Local Coordination Committees accused Syrian forces of launching ""raids and (making) indiscriminate arrests in a Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus. ""UNRWA deplores the tragic loss of life and expresses the view that threats to (Palestinian) refugees and other civilians can be avoided. All sides must refrain from conducting the conflict in civilian areas and must comply with their obligations under international law,"" the statement said. Diplomatic front: New envoy to Syria to work with Arab leaders . International envoy Lakhdar Brahimi arrived in Cairo on Sunday to meet with Arab League officials on the Syrian crisis, Egyptian state media reported. This is Brahimi's first such meeting since becoming the U.N.-Arab League special envoy to Syria. He faces the daunting task of trying to help stop the bloodshed in the war-torn country. While in Egypt, Brahimi will meet with Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, Arab League Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby and several Syrian opposition figures to talk about the Syrian crisis, his spokesman Ahmed Fawzi told Egypt's state-run MENA news agency. British Foreign Secretary William Hague will arrive in Cairo on Monday night for a two-day visit focused on Syria, the Palestinian-Israeli issue and economic matters, according to MENA. A family's desperate story . After spending a few days in Egypt, Brahimi has said he will head next to Damascus. Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Eraqij told his nation's semi-official Mehr news agency on Sunday that Brahimi has indicated he'll visit Tehran soon after his trip to Syria. The United Nations says more than 18,000 people -- mostly civilians -- have been killed in Syria since March 2011. Opposition activists put the toll much higher, at more than 24,000 people. Jouejati, an LCC spokeswoman, said Sunday that the situation should be classified as ""genocide."" CNN cannot independently verify death tolls because the Syrian government has severely restricted access to the country by foreign journalists. Russia: Sanctions against Syria hurt Russian business . Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said U.S. sanctions on Syria and Iran are harming Russian business interests. ""The unilateral American sanctions against Syria and Iran are increasingly becoming extraterritorial in nature and are directly affecting the interests of Russian business, in particular banks,"" Lavrov said Saturday, according to the state news agency RIA Novosti. The United States and other Western countries have sharply criticized Russia, accusing it of defending the Syrian regime for financial interests and thereby allowing the regime's bloody crackdown on dissidents to continue. Russia, along with China, has repeatedly vetoed attempts at the U.N. Security Council to take tougher action against the Syrian government. But Russia will push the Security Council to endorse a peace plan that would set up a transitional government in Syria, RIA Novosti reported. World leaders agreed on the plan in Geneva this year. But while U.S. and British leaders said they don't foresee al-Assad in the transitional government, Russia said the Geneva plan ""did not imply that Assad should step down,"" RIA Novosti said. U.S. politician says his country needs to take further action . U.S. Sen. John McCain blasted President Barack Obama for not doing more to back the Syrian opposition, calling his administration's actions thus far ""shameful."" The Arizona Republican said the United States should get opposition fighters weapons ""so it's a fair fight"" and establish a ""sanctuary or free zone"" from which the opposition can operate. He said he is not asking that U.S. troops be sent into Syria to battle government forces. McCain, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, said a lack of international action to date has contributed to the ""rise of extremists, rise of al Qaeda, (and a) greater threat of chemical weapons."" ""We've sat still and watched this massacre go on now (with) over 20,000 people (killed),"" he told CNN Saturday. ""How many have to die before we act?""

ffca8689daa4358e5738995f09226fa6c8efbbd5,"(CNN) -- Boxing world champion Wladimir Klitschko has told CNN that David Haye will become the 50th knockout victim of his career when the two face-off in July. The IBF, IBO and WBO heavyweight champion is set to face WBA champ Haye in Hamburg, Germany, on July 2 in a bid to unify four of the division's five belts. The Ukrainian recently pulled out of his scheduled April 30 fight with another British boxer, Derek Chisora, and boasts a formidable record during his 15-year career, winning 55 of his 58 fights -- 49 coming via knockout. And he claims Haye is the perfect man to help him notch up a landmark half century. He told CNN: ""I knocked out 49 fighters and David Haye is going to be the 50th on my list. I am looking forward to it, I will get a great challenge in the ring. ""He will try to get through with his strategy, psychological and physical game and I'm ready for it because I'm a true professional athlete and have been doing it for such a long time. I love to be challenged."" Londoner Haye can also point to an impressive record in the sport, having won 25 of his 26 fights, 23 coming via knockout. The 30-year-old moved up from the Cruiserweight division in 2008 and has made public his desire to fight Wladimir, and his older brother, the WBC heavyweight champion Vitali, before he retires on his birthday -- October 13 this year. When Wladimir was asked what would happen if Haye was to win their July bout, he replied: ""(Defeat) is not an option -- myself and Vitali are going to unify all the belts. ""Haye is quick and his record speaks for itself. He won a lot of fights by knockout, so I will not underestimate his speed or his punching power. ""I've been in boxing for last 15 years and I'm going to be close to 60 fights, I know exactly what to expect from every single opponent."" Wladimir also denied that he will enjoy any advantage from the fact that the contest will be staged in Germany -- the country that has hosted many of his title fights in the past. He explained: ""It's not really an advantage because the ring is the same everywhere -- it has four corners with a referee in between you and your opponent.

Liverpool were prepared to offer more money if there was a chance of securing Origi's release from Lille in January and the Belgium international, who signed for Liverpool for £10million earlier this year, had indicated he would be prepared to move to the Premier League if a deal could be arranged. Rodgers, though, believes the chances of getting Origi are virtually non-existent and has insisted he will channel his energies into the players he has who are fit and available. 'It was never the case of bringing him in early,' explained the Liverpool boss. 'The discussion last summer was that he had to stay. That was one of the reasons we got him. There has been a lot of speculation but the deal was in place that we would get him for next season. Liverpool return to Crystal Palace on Sunday for the first time since they threw away a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 against them last season in a game that became to be known as 'Crystanbul' - in reference to Liverpool's famous recovery from a three-goal deficit during the 2005 Champions Final against AC Milan in Istanbul.

ffcb22794fbf2635808be84e1933e023fb86c5a4,"(CNN) -- A Maryland man recently died of rabies that he contracted from a tainted kidney he received in a transplant operation a year and a half ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Health care teams are now giving anti-rabies shots to three other patients who received organs from the same donor as the patient, the CDC said. The Maryland man and three other people -- in Florida, Georgia and Illinois -- received organs from a person who died in Florida in 2011. Coincidentally, both the donor and the recipient who died are members of the military. The donor was a 20-year-old airman who was training to be an aviation mechanic in Pensacola, and the recipient was a retired Army veteran, according to the Department of Defense. Doctors knew the donor had encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, when they harvested the organs. However, no rabies test was done before the before the donor's kidneys, heart and liver were delivered for transplantation in September 2011, the CDC said. 4 shots enough to ward off rabies . The Maryland recipient died February 27 at the VA Medical Center in Washington, and doctors at the CDC diagnosed rabies as the cause of death. The CDC then examined autopsy tissue from the donor and determined he had died of the same type of rabies, which is spread by raccoons, according to the CDC. Health officials immediately contacted doctors caring for the other three organ recipients. They show no signs of rabies but are being treated with five doses of the rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin, which gives the body antibodies to protect itself against the rabies virus. Both treatments are shots in the upper arm. Dr. Matthew Kuehnert, director of the CDC's Office of Blood, Organ, and Other Tissue Safety, said the recipients' doctors were shocked to learn the donor's organs were tainted with rabies. ""Their first reaction was that it seemed unlikely because it's been almost a year and a half since the transplant,"" he said. In the only other U.S. outbreak of rabies among organ recipients, the four patients died within a month of transplant in 2004. The three other recipients are being tested for rabies, and health authorities are looking for family members or health care workers who might have had close contact with the donor or the recipient who died to see if they might also have the disease, said CDC spokeswoman Melissa Dankel. Why organs aren't tested for rabies . Before the airman died in Florida, he was experiencing ""changes in mental status,"" according to Kuehnert. He said the donor tested negative for several causes of encephalitis, including West Nile Virus and herpes. Organ donors are not routinely tested for rabies, even if they show the signs. One reason is rabies is extremely rare, with only one to three cases a year nationwide, according to Dr. Richard Franka, the CDC's acting rabies team lead. Also, many lifesaving organs would be lost if donors were tested for rabies. Only three or four facilities in the country are capable of testing for rabies in humans, Franka said, which means most hospitals would have to ship a potential donor's blood or tissue. It could take two days to get test results, and by then the organs would no longer be usable. Kuehnert said perhaps new rules need to be put in place to help doctors decide what to do with organs when the donor has died of encephalitis and no one knows why. ""What we need looking forward is a standardized approach when you have encephalitis of unknown cause so very important things like this aren't missed,"" he said. At least one transplant surgeon won't take organs when the donor has died of encephalitis of unknown origin. Dr. Amy Friedman, director of transplantation at SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, New York, said the risk is too big. But she added that she does kidney transplants, and her patients can survive, at least in the short term, on dialysis. Other patients waiting for organs such as hearts or livers might die quickly without a transplant -- and sometimes the only organ available is one where the patient died of encephalitis and no one knows why. Those patients should be fully informed so they can decide if they want to take the risk, she wrote in a blog post Friday. ""Statistically it's quite likely the organ could be fine, but if it's not, everybody has trouble,"" she told CNN. CNN's Miriam Falco, Val Willingham and Georgiann Caruso contributed to this report.","A Maryland man who received a tainted organ in 2011 died last month .

Authors often base their novels on their own experiences, over-heard conversations or eccentric characters they may have met throughout their lives. But one writer has caused offense by keeping her characters too close to home - as she's been accused of basing them on her own neighbours. Friends of novelist Angela Hargreaves, who lives in Eccleshall, Staffordshire, are now refusing to speak to her after private conversations they've had with her and secrets they've confided have allegedly ended up in her book. Art imitating life? Angela Hargreaves has been accused of basing her racy characters on her neighbours . Hargreaves' novel Rotten Row was published earlier this year and its steamy scenes and saucy characters have appealed to readers whose interest in erotic fiction has been piqued by Fifty Shades of Grey. On Amazon, the book is described as containing 'tales of love, death, nostalgic regret, sexual encounters, . romance, marriage, divorce and desperate times but ultimately how . quickly our fortunes can and do change. 'Rotten Row is about the petty spitefulness and complexity of living in close proximity to some neighbours,' it adds. Hargreaves, 57, is now experiencing such complexities with her own neighbours who are outraged that some of her characters appear to be based on them. Emma Williams, 46, a civil servant who has known Hargreaves for ten years, said she believes the character Lucy - described as 'boring' with a 'mundane job' - is inspired by her. She was shocked to find similar conversations to those she'd had in confidence with Hargreaves in the novel. Controversial: But Hargreaves says it's all fictional . 'It’s so upsetting, because it’s my . next-door neighbour. The things I’ve been involved in have now come out in a book. I haven’t . spoken to her since the novel came out and she is no longer a friend,' she told the Daily Telegraph. Another neighbour, who did not want to be . named, said the book had caused 'major problems' and that there have been 'a lot of tears shed'. 'How would you like to . live next to somebody who was writing things that were talked about in . private into black and white? It is unreal,' they told the newspaper. Characters in the novel include a sex-mad florist, a cheating boyfriend and a buxom caterer. There's also a male character described as a 'decrepit old wreck' who chases women and a sex-obsessed widow described as a 'termagant little hag of a woman'. Hargreaves, who lives with her husband and their dogs, has denied that any of the characters are based on her neighbours and said she has been 'quite upset' by the fall out. 'We’ve been crossed off the invitation list for Christmas parties and cards,' she said. She has also taken to Amazon, where her novel has received mixed reviews, to defend her work. She writes in the product description: 'The characters in Rotten Row are fictional and many of the things that happen in the book didn't happen at all. 'I made them up or stole them from the lives of other people that I've met over the years. All have been hugely exaggerated for comic or tragic effect. 'I had a ""I'll use this someday file"" and hoped to one day take advantage of what seemed to me to be a collection of just the sort of comic slightly public episodes that was destined to be used by someone sooner rather than later. 'My fictitious characters live in the fictional village of Upton Green.'","Angela Hargreaves' novel Rotten Row is described as a tale of 'sexual encounters' and the 'complexity of living in close proximity to some neighbours'

ffcb8ca79f90cc458c79feef7745f7acd9e19aa3,"A hospital has suspended cancer surgery over fears that five patients died unnecessarily within a year. Keyhole operations on patients with cancer of the oesophagus have been halted with immediate effect, the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust announced yesterday. The hospital had been one of the few areas in the country to do the operation and surgeons had been travelling around the world lecturing about its benefits. Five patients died from 'potentially avoidable' complications after surgery at Maidstone Hospital . One of the patients who died was a 51-year-old father-of-one, whose lawyers say he was cajoled into having the procedure and ‘made to feel like a human guinea pig’. The Mail understands that the surgeons filmed the operation on him last July –and it was broadcast live to a medical conference taking place in the UK . The same man died 16 days later from a blood clot and his family are now taking legal action against the trust. Bosses have refused to name the surgeons involved, but the trust confirmed that the surgeons were still working, although the matter has been referred to the General Medical Council – which may decide to suspend them. The trust has also luanched its own internal inquiry. Solicitor Sharon Lam, acting for man’s widow, told the Mail: ‘There seem to be serious questions to be asked about the reliability of the procedure in question. New surgical techniques are vital but they must not be tried out on patients until they are safe.’ Initially, the patient was due to have the standard open surgery to remove the tumour as  which has a longer recovery period. But days before the operation, surgeons persuaded him to have the keyhole surgery, as he would recover quicker. He also consented  for the procedure to be broadcast live at  a conference. Miss Lam said: ‘He was made to feel really lucky to have this surgery rather than the conventional open surgery.’ Upper GI surgery has been suspended and the trust is now sending patients requiring it to St Thomas' Hospital in central London instead . The operation went well and 11 days later the patient was discharged. Five days later he suffered a major haemorrhage. He was taken to hospital, but died the next day. Miss Lam added: ‘My client, the man’s widow, is very upset by the whole episode. She wrote a letter of complaint  to the hospital and the surgeon replied. ‘It is highly unusual as complaints are normally dealt with by the hospital trust, not by the consultant. He said there had been complications that had led to the patient’s death. He did not say sorry or give any kind of apology.’ She added that the patient should have had a good prospect of recovery, but instead his death has left his family traumatised. The keyhole operation normally lasts four hours, and involves removing the tumour and surrounding tissue using a microscopic camera and surgical instruments. At the same time surgeons use part of the stomach to create a section of oesophagus to replace the infected section. Patients of the trust in Kent are being sent instead to St Thomas’ Hospital in central London. Medical director at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells trust, Dr Paul Sigston, said: ‘We are sorry that some patients did not receive the level of care and treatment that they should have due to potentially avoidable surgical complications. ‘We are in contact with, and have apologised to, the families who have been affected and have been clear that we need to make improvements.’","Scandal involves upper gastrointestinal surgery at Maidstone Hospital .

Over the last few weeks here in Brazil, a public initially sceptical about this World Cup and their team’s chances had allowed itself to be swept along. On Tuesday night, though, it didn’t take long for Luiz Felipe Scolari’s team to show themselves for what they really are. By half-time, most people in this particular establishment had gone back to their food and their free bar. Outside under an awning a couple of musicians had begun to warm up. The warning signs had been there from the start, of course. The first goal of this tournament was an own goal, scored by a Brazilian. That day here in Sao Paulo, the home team needed a leg up from a referee to get by against Croatia. The problem with momentum and emotion, though, is that it clouds issues. Realities of life and sport get forgotten and that’s a good thing. It allows you to feel and think things that really aren’t logical. And that is how it has been here.

Overreaction: Brazil were looking backwards at Neymar's injury, not forwards to the game . I saw Brazil play their second group games against Mexico – a goalless draw – and Cameroon – a 4-1 win – and it was clear on both occasions that this was a Brazilian team carrying deeper flaws than perhaps any in the nation’s history. Even in beating Cameroon – just about the weakest team in the competition – Brazil looked uncomfortable. Across the back, they were awful. And that was with Thiago Silva – suspended for the Germany clash – in the team. Rescued by Neymar on that occasion, I suggested in my match report that Brazil would run in to a hiding before long.

Fred, Hulk, Jo, Maicon. These are players that would not get many games between them in the Barclays Premier League. Some have tried, and failed. This, remember, was a World Cup.

The Chileans hit the crossbar in extra time that day and maybe the coach sensed then – if he hadn’t before – that his squad wasn’t good enough. Certainly the manner in which they subsequently hacked Colombia off the field in the last eight – and the faux commiserations that followed from the likes of David Luiz – were depressing. The nation, however, was almost delirious by then. Such was the hysteria about Neymar’s injury that the build up to Tuesday’s game was spent with millions of people looking backwards, rather than forwards. Perhaps Scolari and his players did, too. Against Germany they certainly played . as though they hadn’t prepared. Even Neymar, Pele, Zico and Socrates . between them wouldn’t have stopped this happening.

The palace statement said the operation went well, and the king was in a satisfactory condition post-surgery. ""This morning his general health conditions have improved. His heart rate has lowered, his blood pressure is normal and his body temperature has lowered,"" said the statement.

Last month, Bhumibol was discharged after being hospitalized for more than a month for treatment of a stomach complaint. And in August last year, he was discharged from Siriraj Hospital after a stay of nearly four years, having been admitted in September 2009 for treatment for a lung inflammation. A constitutional monarch who ascended the throne in 1946, the U.S.-born, Swiss-educated king has reigned over more than 20 prime ministers. He has stayed out of the public eye during the current political crisis, which led to a coup in May, spending much of his time at the royal palace in the southern seaside town of Hua Hin.

ffcbe464b2a7bc9d64e5990771490f142bd7fe75,"Hong Kong (CNN)Hong Kong authorities have vowed to conduct an impartial investigation into a video which appears to show several plainclothes police officers beating up a detained pro-democracy demonstrator. The widely circulated video shows officers carrying the man to a dark corner, where he's laid on the ground and repeatedly kicked and punched while others stand around, apparently keeping watch. ""Police express concern over the video clip showing several plainclothes officers who are suspected of using excessive force,"" said a statement issued by the Hong Kong Information Services Department Wednesday morning. ""The Complaints Against Police Office has already received a relevant complaint and will handle it in accordance with the established procedures in a just and impartial manner."" Hong Kong's Secretary of Security Lai Tung Kwok told reporters the ""officers involved will be temporarily removed from their current duties."" He declined to take questions. Embattled Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung said there was a set and effective mechanism in place to deal with complaints against police. ""We will use the same mechanisms and procedures to deal with the complaint against the policemen on the incident last night,"" he said. Claims of 'brutal violence' The victim has been identified as Ken Tsang, a member of the Civic Party, who's also a social worker and a member of the 1,200 member election committee that choses Hong Kong's leader. Civic Party leader Alan Leong told CNN: ""This is an apparent abuse of police power that a society as civilized as Hong Kong would definitely not swallow. I would advise the commissioner of police to immediately arrest the six officers involved in that attack."" Tsang's lawyer Dennis Kwok said, in the early hours of Wednesday morning, ""six or seven police officers"" led his client to a corner where they punched and kicked him. ""It was unprovoked and unnecessary for anyone to use that kind of violence on an arrested person,"" Kwok said. He said some people had accused Tsang of pouring water on police, but ""whatever he was doing he was already arrested, his hands were cuffed and the proper procedure was to take him into custody and deal with him in accordance with the law."" Amnesty International called for the prosecution of any officers found to have acted unlawfully. ""It is stomach-churning to think there are Hong Kong police officers that feel they are above the law,"" said Mabel Au, the group's Hong Kong director. One of protest groups -- Occupy Central With Love and Peace -- circulated photos showing large circular welts on Tsang's back, bruising on his face and scratches on his neck and arms. Another main protest group -- The Hong Kong Federation of Students -- issued a statement calling for the resignation of Police Commissioner Andy Tsang Wai-hunh, and other police commanders involved in preventing protesters from re-occupying Lung Wo road on Tuesday night. The road runs past the central government offices, and is near the main Admiralty protest site, the epicenter of the weeks long standoff between protesters and police. Protest clashes . Protesters accused police of using pepper spray during the operation, which succeeded in clearing the road for traffic. A total of 45 people -- 37 men and eight women -- were arrested for alleged unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers, police said. Authorities accused them of behaving ""in a disorderly manner,"" throwing traffic cones, snatching police barriers and building road blocks. Four police were injured in the operation, according to a government statement. During the attempted takeover of Lung Wo road, demonstrators declared they were ""not afraid of anything."" ""Ask them if they're afraid of bullets. They're not. This is our last chance. We know we're most likely going to fail, but we have to try,"" said 62-year-old demonstrator Lo Cheong. Retaking Lung Wo road was necessary ""to protect the protesters,"" said a demonstrator named Bon. In a statement released on Wednesday morning, police appealed to protesters in the area to ""stay calm and restrained."" ""Protestors advancing against Police cordon line even with their arms raised is not a peaceful act,"" the statement said. By dawn, morning rush-hour traffic was flowing as normal. The contingent of demonstrators relocated to a park near the government offices, to a green space that they're occupying with tents. Protest disruption . Since late September, protesters from a number of pro-democracy groups have been blocking major roads, demanding a greater say in who leads the Special Administrative Region of China. At the peak of the protests, tens of thousands of demonstrators crowded onto the streets, calling for the resignation of leader C.Y. Leung, and demanding the right to be able to nominate candidates for the next election in 2017. Who's who in the protests? Protesters have been guarding barricades erected at protest sites at Admiralty, Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, and for many nights slept in the open air on the asphalt before the arrival of reinforcements with tents over the weekend. Traffic in the other parts of the city has been clogged due to road closures, bus and tram cancellations and the need for cars to drive around the protest sites. Taxi drivers say their takings are down, and businesses claim the protests have cost them income. Hope that the two sides might be able to solve the impasse evaporated on Thursday when the government canceled talks planned with student groups, after protest leaders urged supporters to keep up the occupation. 'Not a revolution' On the weekend, Hong Kong's chief executive told local free-to-air station TVB that the protests were not a ""revolution,"" but a ""mass movement that has spun out of control."" Who is C.Y. Leung? He said student leaders had ""almost zero chance"" of pushing Beijing to change its stance on how Hong Kong's leader is elected. He added he would not submit to the protesters' demands that he resign, because his resignation ""will not solve the problem."" ""It is because the students and other occupation protesters demand more than that. They want the Standing Committee to withdraw its August 31 decision. That is impossible,"" he said. Beijing white paper . He was referring to the white paper issued by the Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress stating that Hongkongers would be able to vote on their leader in 2017, but only from an approved shortlist of candidates. In response to Leung's comments, the three main groups leading the occupy campaign said it was the government that was out of control -- ""a government that fires tear-gas at unarmed citizens and unilaterally terminated dialogue with the students (sic)."" On September 28, police fired 87 tear gas rounds into the crowd after protesters failed to disperse. The move was seen as a miscalculation and only served to garner support for the protesters, who accused the government of heavy handedness and of stifling free speech. The end of police trust?

ffcc51db54f8ebdf9a00407213c1d8ab859185b3,"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Race and politics are a combustible combo that explodes into headlines when an ex-president lights the fuse, as Jimmy Carter did recently. President Obama during the 2008 campaign faced questions over race and politics. ""When a radical fringe element of demonstrators and others begin to attack the president of the United States as an animal or as a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler or when they wave signs in the air that said we should have buried Obama with Kennedy, those kinds of things are beyond the bounds,"" the Democrat told students at Emory University on Wednesday. ""I think people who are guilty of that kind of personal attack against Obama have been influenced to a major degree by a belief that he should not be president because he happens to be African-American,"" he added. The controversy erupted this week when Carter first raised the race issue to NBC. ""An overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man,"" he said. Bill Cosby, a black comedian and actor, said Wednesday in a written statement that he agrees with Carter. ""During President Obama's speech on the status of health care reform, some members of Congress engaged in a public display of disrespect,"" he said. CNN contributor David Gergen said that some of the allegations of race-baiting might have some weight among Democratic voters. ""Jimmy Carter, I'm afraid, is not alone in his views,"" he said. But Gergen warns that the racists tend to be on the fringes of the right and do not reflect on the greater field of opponents to Obama's ideology. ""But I think it's wrongheaded, and I think it's unfair, and I think it's indeed a libel upon many of the opponents, most of the opponents of health care reform, to say that they're racist,"" he said. ""Seven previous presidents have tried to bring health care reforms of this kind. All seven have failed. And, as I recall, all seven were white."" Carter's comments, though, are the kind that raise people's defenses. In particular, they turn off independents, who by nature tend to hate the hard edges of politics. The White House, for its part, wants no part of the Carter controversy. ""The president does not believe that that criticism comes based on the color of his skin,"" said White House press secretary Robert Gibbs. As a candidate, Obama understood the political danger in letting his race become a major topic. He largely avoided it when he could, but race was always a subtext, as it is now in his presidency. ""But I can also say, frankly, that this White House and even his campaign were very afraid to even go down this road dealing with anything with race,"" said CNN contributor Roland Martin. Carter also told NBC that there is an ""inherent feeling among many people in this country that an African-American ought not to be president and ought not to be given the same respect as if he were white."" Framing criticism as racism cropped up several times during the campaign. When Geraldine Ferraro, a Clinton supporter, said during the 2008 Democratic primaries that Obama would never have gotten as far as he had if he had not been black, candidate Obama pointedly left race out of it. ""I think that her comments were ridiculous,"" Obama said at the time. But Ferraro blamed Obama supporters for her hate mail, saying ""I have been called all kinds of names. And the attacks are ageist. They're sexist. They're racist."" iReport.com: Freedom from speech? And the topic of race even came to haunt Bill Clinton, the so-called first black president. Before the New Hampshire primary in January 2008, Clinton told an audience that ""there's no difference in [Obama's] voting record and Hillary's ever since. Give me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I have ever seen."" Some interpreted that as belittling Obama's campaign. After much criticism, Clinton later said he was talking about Obama's opposition to the war in Iraq, not his campaign. But those two words -- ""fairy tale"" -- launched weeks worth of accusations, sometimes on the front page of The New York Times, that the Clintons were playing the race card. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on race and politics . Some observers said Carter's statement was far too broad, and that many of the attacks on Obama are about policy, not race. ""I don't think one can paint a broad brush in saying that all of these folks who have criticism, anybody who criticizes the president ... is based upon the issue of race,"" Martin said. Mary Matalin, a CNN contributor and Republican strategist, said Carter's criticism is ""absurd."" ""It's very dangerous politics,"" she said. ""Barack Obama got, in the last election, more white male voters than any of his predecessors. ... Republicans and conservatives and Democrats and liberals, the whole country felt very good putting -- setting aside policies after his election.""","Former President Carter says criticism of Obama is largely based on race .

ffcc56d1c18bfdcc03ea1d8256e8d001d742ae44,"Chengdu, China (CNN) -- The researcher dressed in blue plastic smock, slippers and gloves is having a tough time getting his work done. Every time Zhang Zhen sets up his camera on a tripod in an effort to document the behavior of one of the panda cubs scattered on a grassy hillside, one particularly frisky baby panda comes wobbling towards him, interrupting his shoot. ""Mumu!"" he yells in frustration, as the four-month old cub rears up on her hind legs, lunging towards him. He picks Mumu up and deposits her at the opposite end of the enclosure. ""I'm not sure why she's been all over me like this. I think she's excited today,"" Zhang says. Mumu is the oldest of fourteen baby pandas that were born last summer here at the Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding in Chengdu, China. China's panda experts have improved the science of breeding and raising members of this endangered species in captivity. The proof of their success is in the baby panda enclosure, where visitors can watch as the newest generation of pandas takes turns napping, playing and exploring their outdoor habitat. The fuzzy young cubs are still shaky on their feet, and often trip and roll down the enclosure's slight incline. While two cubs wrestle, another tries to climb a tree and then tumbles onto its back, slowly performing a backwards somersault, much to the amusement of onlookers. Giant panda Tian Tian likely miscarried . ""There are new breakthroughs, so that's why the panda population has continued to increase,"" said Deng Tao, the chief zoo keeper at the Chengdu base. When Deng first began working at the base 12 years ago, he said there were only 20 pandas here. Today, the center is responsible for more than 100 animals. Deng recently returned from the Atlanta Zoo, where he spent months assisting with the birth and care of twin cubs who were born there last July. ""Now we have new technologies that can very accurately identify when a panda is ovulating and do artificial insemination during a precise point in the [reproductive] cycle,"" Deng explained. On its website, the Atlanta Zoo credited Deng and his colleagues in Chengdu with developing a technique using incubators and taking turns rotating twin cubs with the mother to better ensure the newborns' chance of survival. ""Before when a panda had twins, the mother panda could only take care of one cub so we have resolved the issue of having twin pandas and helping them to integrate,"" Deng said. The next big challenge facing China's panda keepers involves reintroducing captive animals back to the wild. ""We have made a training base to return pandas to the wild,"" Deng explained. ""Once they are mature and able to forage for food and hide from danger, then we will release some pandas."" National Zoo's panda cub is healthy, officials say . Wildlife conservation groups say China's effort to save the giant panda from extinction is a rare success story. According to the World Wildlife Fund, as of 1988 there were only around 1,000 pandas left living in the wild. In 2004, that number was estimated to have grown to 1,600 wild pandas. More recent panda census statistics are not yet available. ""The government put the resources [into conservation]. They've actually set up some mountains just as a habitat for the panda,"" said May Mei, the chief representative in China for the conservation group WildAid. China has lavished resources on the conservation of the giant panda- rather than on some other indigenous endangered species- in large part because the animal is such an important national symbol. ""They are a treasure for people in China,"" Mei said. The breeding center in Chengdu is also something of a panda theme park. Excerpts from the animated DreamWorks film ""Kung Fu Panda"" play on a giant screen at the entrance to the facility, which receives more than a million visitors a year. Inside, tourists travel in panda mobiles, decorated with the cartoon movie's main character, Po the Panda. In addition to stuffed animal pandas, souvenir shops offer a variety of hats, ear muffs, and even fuzzy nunchucks decorated with the panda's distinctive black-and-white panda patterns. Visitors walk along paths, gazing and taking photos of pandas in large outdoor pens. The animals seem to completely ignore humans. In one pen, a 25-year-old male named Shi-shi lies on his back, gorging himself on bamboo which he holds in his front paw with the help of what trainers call the panda's ""pseudo-thumb."" Other adults seem to spend much of their time fast asleep in their enclosures. But the big lumbering animals clearly have charisma. ""They're cute man!"" says Chris Delbene, a 21-year-old university student from Orego who is studying Chinese in Beijing. ""They live a great lifestyle, play all day, eat, sleep."" What's cuter than one baby panda? Panda twins! CNN's Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","China's panda experts improved breeding pandas in captivity .

ffcc5e7d5eabf9516aa2e9374fbe1bc77dcef943,"Davos, Switzerland (CNN)  -- Despite deep public spending cuts that triggered waves of protests last year, Greece will not default on its debt payment obligations, Prime Minister George Papandreou told CNN. ""This is not on the books ... it's not on our road map. And this is why we are talking about these other measures, which we think are enough to be able to make things sustainable,"" Papandreou told CNN's Richard Quest on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday. ""Obviously (it will be) difficult, but we have been doing our work, and we will be successful,"" he said. The economic troubles in Greece last year sparked a wave of sovereign debt woes across Europe, especially hitting Ireland, Spain and Portugal. The value of the euro cratered during the debt crisis and raised lingering questions about the viability of the 17-nation monetary union. A Bloomberg Global Poll released this week at Davos show 59% of respondents believe that at least one or more euro nation would break from the monetary union by 2016, and nearly three-quarters polled thought Greece would default on its loans. ""Well, maybe people will believe things, but that's why we politicians are here, to put things on the right course,"" Papandreou said when asked about the poll. ""And there is the political will of our peoples and the leaders of the European Union ... to make sure that in 2016 and 2020 and on, the euro will exist."" His comments echoed the sentiment French President Nicolas Sarkozy who in his Davos address Thursday said: ""We will never abandon the euro. Never! Euro spells Europe, the euro is Europe. Europe has meant 60 years of peace on our continent. We will never abandon that."" Sarkozy's spirited defense of the euro underlined how high the stakes have become for the economic evolution of the continent. ""To imagine that we might pull out of that is to ignore the fact that as people who have been at each other's throats for centuries, we now have one wish, and that is lasting peace,"" Sarkozy said. But European Monetary Union has been challenged as the bailout of Greece thrust the spotlight on the uneven economics among member nations. Besides debt woes in Greece, countries like Ireland and Spain were deeply exposed to the crash of the housing bubble. Meanwhile, the German economy -- the largest in Europe -- enjoyed its fastest expansion in two decades last year and its largest growth in GDP since Germany reunified in 1990. Concern has grown of an unfair burden placed on larger economies by the problems of smaller economies like Greece. But Papandreou said Greece is well on its way toward reducing its debt. ""We have made very good progress, because we're on track, and I would say, even, beyond. We have cut the deficit by over 6.5 percent, which is a huge cut,"" Papandreou said. ""We've changed our pension system, it's now a viable pension system, one of the most viable in Europe. We've changed our tax system, it's transparent, more effective, hitting tax evasion,"" he said. ""But the structural things we're changing are actually going to bring growth."" Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, told CNN ""this is no time for complacency -- that is absolutely clear. But let me tell you, nevertheless, that the real economy is giving signs that are encouraging. ""The main risk is to practice benign neglect ... as soon as things are going better, to forget that we had to cope with a very, very demanding crisis,"" Trichet said. ""So, we have to draw all the lessons."" CNN's Richard Quest, Kevin Voigt and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","Prime Minister Papandreou: Greece will not default on its debt payment obligations .

Police statistics show one victim is held up by a knife-carrying criminal every 35 minutes. Senior officers have warned the attacks are carried out by muggers determined to steal smartphones and cash. On the rise: The number of robberies committed at knife-point rose by 10 per cent in the year to September 2011, new figures show (picture posed by models) Separate figures show a double digit rise in the number of pickpocket thefts – the biggest increase for nearly a decade. Across England and Wales, robbery rose by 4 per cent in the year to September 2011 compared with the previous 12 months. There were 15,313 knifepoint robberies in the same period – up 10 per cent from the 13,971 offences a year earlier, police crime statistics showed. Around half of all robberies took place in London and the most common items stolen were smartphones, bags and cash. The Metropolitan Police recorded a 13 per cent rise in robberies in the capital and West Midlands Police recorded a 10 per cent increase. Former Met commissioner Lord Stevens, who is chairing a commission into the future of policing set up by Labour, said the rise in crimes against the person was ‘a bit alarming’. He said: ‘I’m not surprised. It’s really worrying. We’ve got to get on top of them really quickly or you could run out of control.’ The British Crime Survey, based on a poll of more than 40,000 victims, suggested a 5 per cent rise in burglary, and a 7 per cent increase in car theft. Pickpocket thefts rose by 12 per cent to nearly 600,000, while garden shed break-ins fuelled a 15 per cent rise in other thefts of personal property. Policing minister Nick Herbert said there are areas of concern and crime remains too high . However ministers will be heartened that overall recorded crime fell fractionally. The number recorded was down by 4 per cent to 4.1million. Chief Constable Jon Murphy, from the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘While incidents in violence against the person fell, a continued cause for concern was the increase in pickpocketing, robbery and robbery with knives.’ ‘This has been driven by a rise in robberies of personal property and police will want to focus on tackling these offences and offering crime-prevention advice.’ Meanwhile the number of murders and other killings rose by 5 per cent in the year to March 2011, said the Home Office. That is a rise of 28 – taking the total number of violent deaths to 636, up from 608 in 2009/10. The latter includes the 12 victims of the Cumbrian shootings in June 2010 by Derrick Bird. Ministers are set to introduce a ‘tough’ law meaning automatic jail for anyone caught carrying a knife with the intention of using it to commit a crime. Currently just one in five of those caught carrying a knife is given a jail term. The rest are handed community sentences, fines or other punishments. Policing minister Nick Herbert said: ‘Today’s crime figures cannot be used to show there is a long-term change in either direction. There are areas of concern and, as we have consistently said, crime remains too high. ‘We know good policing makes a difference.’ Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has introduced a number of measures to reduce the prison population . Ken Clarke (right) has come under constant attack over his money-saving plans to reduce the prison population by 3,000 by putting fewer offenders behind bars. He stunned the Tory conference in 2010 by announcing he wanted to scrap prison term of less than six months in favour of community sentences. That policy was heavily criticised last month after it emerged a quarter of criminals break their non-custodial punishments. Last year, the Justice Secretary caused outrage by suggesting that some rapes were more serious than others as he attempted to defend proposed shorter jail terms for some rapists. Then last May it was revealed that less than a third of convicted muggers and car thieves end up in jail. Furthermore, just over half of drug dealers go to prison – and only 43 per cent of those who have sex with a child under 13 are put behind bars. The row within the Tory Party itself about the Justice Secretary's approach re-emerged in October when Home Secretary Theresa May and Boris Johnson urged him to extend minimum jail terms to under-18s. However, he dismissed their call. A month later, it emerged that youth courts are jailing just one in four teenage muggers. Most young criminals are facing nothing harsher than rehabilitation, fines or community service. Even during the 'crackdown' over August's riots, the average sentence was well below two years.","Around half of all robberies took place in London .

But far from the unidentifiable meats, bland sauces and soggy vegetables the average economy flyer is begrudgingly accustomed too, the meals are actually from Business Class. Just like on the plane, you can choose from the regular or vegetarian option. Every Wednesday, customers will receive delivery of the same meal being served to passengers sitting up front on Lufthansa that week. Familiar:  This is the sort of meal the average flyer is usually faced with on flights . Options: Customers are given a choice of regular or vegetarian options . The full meal costs €9.99 (approximately £7.85) per week and €8.99 (approximately £7.05) for vegetarian. The food arrives cold and needs to be cooked in the oven before consuming. It is also suitable for freezing. On the menu next week is 'Chinese Shin of Beef', and 'Shak Navratan Indian Vegetables' for the vegetarian options. Cutting down on waste: Catering company LSG Sky Chefs reduces waste by using the surplus Business Class meals not ordered by passengers on board . Other upcoming dishes include 'Emperor Bream with Herb Risotto' or 'Panserotti with Ricotta', and 'Chicken Breast with Pepper' or 'Pumpkin Gnocchi with Ragout'. The service is much like any other ready meal delivery, except only one meal per week is currently available. The idea also cuts down on food waste for LSG Sky Chefs, the catering company behind the service, as the surplus meals not ordered by Business Class passengers are used to fill orders, rather than being thrown out.","Air Food One delivers one plane meal per week to customers for £7.85 .

Top schools are finding it difficult to recruit would-be headteachers because job applications are littered with basic mistakes. Covering letters and CVs are often ‘really badly completed’ with appalling spelling and grammar, according to Emma Knights, head of the National Governors' Association. Many candidates often fail to use the correct spelling for the school they are writing to. According to recent figures one in four schools are struggling to employ senior staff. 'Sometimes, it's basic grammar that's wrong', Ms Knights told The Times. 'You don't expect a school leader to be told to put the apostrophe in the right place, or to check that their capital letters are in the right place, or they've got the school name right.' Last month the head of a leading independent school released examples of job applications he had received which exposed the sloppiness and poor standards of literacy among candidates. Brighton College’s Richard Cairns received 50 letters for the position of deputy head. Of the 30 from people working at state schools, he said 12 were ‘semi-literate’ and only one made the shortlist. According to Mr Cairns, some candidates were unsure how to address him in applications. One history teacher said he liked 'to see a student bossom' while a chemistry teacher gave his date of birth as 1053. Mr Cairns also said that many teachers between 25 and 40 who were taught in state schools were never taught basic grammar, spelling and sentence structure. The head called for a minimum standard to be introduced in which teachers would have to achieve at least three B grades at A-level, and a 2:1 degree in their chosen teaching subject. According to Mr Cairns some candidates were unsure how to address him in job applications . The Department for Education said a growing network of teaching schools was helping to ‘identify teachers with potential for headship’. 'I like to see a student bossom' 'I have been a science teacher form more than 10 years' 'Date of birth: 1053' 'Dear Cairns' 'Dear Mr Richard' The National Governors' Association is a charity for 300,000 volunteers who act as school governors, who appoint head teachers. In December 2013, a new international study revealed that British pupils lag behind leading nations including Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and the Chinese city of Shanghai. The study was carried out as part of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), and focused on applied skills rather than theoretical knowledge. The findings show that the UK's average score for maths was 494 and in reading it was 499, roughly average for all countries and on a par with the Czech Republic, France and Norway. Britain did better in science with an above-average 514 points, similar to Australia, Ireland and Slovenia. Official figures have shown that one-in-five of state secondary school maths teachers in England do not have a maths degree, with the same being true of 34 per cent of physics teachers.","Emma Knights is head of the National Governors' Association .

ffcf643b964fff12d67c5b413e6cf4c5b1457eda,"By . Emma Innes . A woman was left paralysed and unable to feed herself after doctors failed to realise she had an abscess in her neck. Jean Warne, 74, was left partially paralysed and unable to lift her arms shortly before her death in March last year. Her family say by the time doctors realised what was wrong, it was too late to save her. Jean Warne was paralysed after doctors failed to diagnosed an abscess in her neck until it was too late . They claim she was also left sitting on a soiled chair and that no one responded when she cried out in pain. They have instructed solicitors to sue Colchester General Hospital, Essex, claiming the lack of dignity Mrs Warne was treated with amounted to a breach of the Human Rights Act. Her son-in-law John Snowden, 64, said: ‘Jean was strong, she was feisty and her brain was working 100 per cent. ‘If she had been given the right treatment and care, she wouldn’t have gone the way she went.’ Shortly after Mrs Warne retired in 2000, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy. But the cancer returned and spread to her spine, leaving her prone to suffering falls. Mrs Warne was admitted to Colchester General Hospital after a fall. She had breast cancer that had spread to her spine . Mr Snowden, of Braintree, Essex, said she would usually be checked over in hospital after a fall and released within a day. But after she was taken from her Gosfield home to Colchester General Hospital in mid-January 2013, her family decided to start looking at care homes she could move into. However, he claims the lack of care and attention his mother-in-law received at the hospital meant she deteriorated rapidly and was never able to leave. He said: ‘She was put in a seat in the mornings and just left there. Throughout that period, she was getting worse and worse. ‘She complained of a pain in her neck and in that time of sitting there an abscess formed in her neck, which eventually paralysed her. ‘She couldn’t even raise her arms to eat her food and they would just take it away. ‘She was left in her bed soiled and she was left in her seat soiled. You wouldn’t treat a dog like she was treated.’ Mr Snowden, a retired AA director, and his wife Melody, 51, visited every day and said they would have to feed her themselves. He added: ‘Melody went up there one day with a friend. ‘They walked in and Jean was in such neck pain, she was screaming out. The lady opposite said she was crying out all through the night and no one came. ‘All they used to do was put her in a private room because she was keeping the other patients awake. It was disgraceful.’ On March 5 2013, Mr and Mrs Snowden were told Mrs Warne had a suspected abscess. Doctors told them she was too frail to survive treatment and had only days to live. However, that night they received a call telling them Mrs Warne was being taken to Romford’s Queen’s Hospital for surgery. Ms Warne's family say staff at the hospital left her sitting in soiled clothes, that they didn't help her to eat when she was too ill to feed herself and that they did not respond when she cried out in pain . Mr Snowden contacted Queen’s and was told when she arrived they almost immediately realised she was too weak to deal with the anaesthetic. Mrs Warne was sent back to Colchester General Hospital, where she died that afternoon. Mr Snowden said they had an initial meeting with doctors who admitted they should have spotted the abscess sooner and should not have sent her to Queen’s. Afterwards, he wrote to former chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts to express his anger, and received a letter back offering a meeting. He refused and got in touch with Leigh Day solicitors. Ten months on, Mr Snowden said his wife, who has needed time off work, was still too upset and angry to speak about her mother’s care. Mrs Warne's family are now taking legal action against Colchester General Hospital . The couple are now pursuing legal action. He said: ‘We could just sit on this and let it go, but people should know about this. ‘At the end of the day, Colchester could go on doing exactly the same thing. ‘I hope the hospital gets its act together. It’s not going to happen overnight, but they must take some responsibility for the pain and suffering that they have given to patients and their families.’ A spokesman for Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘We would like to pass on our sympathy and concerns to the family of this patient following her death in March last year, and are sorry and disappointed that they have concerns. ‘We received a complaint about this patient shortly after her death, which was investigated as a serious incident. ‘One of her consultants met the patient’s daughter and son-in-law and apologised to the patient’s family for some aspects of her care.’","Jean Warne, 74, had breast cancer that had spread to her spine .
She was admitted to Colchester General Hospital after having a fall .
She deteriorated rapidly and was soon partially paralysed because of the abscess - by the time doctors diagnosed it, it was too late to operate .
Her family say she was also left in soiled clothes, not helped to eat when she was too ill to lift her arms and that her cries of pain were ignored .

About 10 birds have died, and another four were injured, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. The culprit apparently used a knife to slit the large gullets beneath their beaks, spokesman Robert Dube said. Throat slasher: 10 brown pelicans on the Florida Keys have died after having their pouches slashed . It comes just over a year after an almost identical attack on the Florida Keys which saw dozens of birds wash up dead on the shore. The birds use the oversized pouches to swallow fish skimmed from the water. Once slashed, they can starve to death. 'It's a slow, agonizing death for these animals,' Dube said. The maimed pelicans have been turning up around the lower Florida Keys, located in the southernmost part of the state. State wildlife officers are seeking tips about the slayings, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is also investigating. While no longer endangered, brown pelicans are protected by state regulations and the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Perpetrators can face fines and even jail time for harming the birds. Identical attack: Last year dozens of the birds were slain an injured by a serial throat slasher in Florida . Local residents have been offering reward money since officials issued an alert last week about the deaths. Wildlife officers suspect teenagers or irate fishermen could be behind the attacks. During winter months, the region also sees many part-time residents from northern states, Dube said. 'Right now we are at a loss,' he said. 'We love our critters down here in the Keys. It's caused a lot of concern.'","10 birds killed and another four injured by throat slashing attack .

A Florida prosecutor hoping to convict George Zimmerman of murder in the Trayvon Martin shooting made a humiliating blunder when her office released a photo of the teen's body. The documents were released today by the office of Special Prosecutor Angela Corey in the case of Zimmerman, who has been charged with second-degree murder in Martin’s February 26 death. But among the pages of evidence was a photo of Martin taken right after his death, as well as Zimmerman’s college records - which were supposed to be kept confidential. Scroll down for videos . Murder case: George Zimmerman, right, has been charged with second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, left, in Sanford, Florida . Out of school: Documents revealed that Zimmerman withdrew from Seminole State College about a month after the shooting . The image, published by TheSmokingGun.com, showed the teen's body face-down in a grassy area where he had been shot in a scuffle with Zimmerman, a neighbourhood watch captain. The files revealed that officers found Martin’s blood on a bag of Skittles in his pocket, and emails from the Sanford Police Department, the Orlando Sentinel reported. The records from Seminole State College revealed that Zimmerman had been placed on academic probation in 2011 for failing to keep his grade point average above 2.0. They also said that Zimmerman had been granted an administrative withdrawal about a month after the shooting. Meanwhile, Zimmerman will seek to have second-degree murder charges dismissed under Florida's 'stand your ground' law in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, his attorney said Thursday. Appeal: Last month, Zimmerman posted a nearly-2 minute, bilingual video thanking fans for their support . The hearing, which likely won't take place for several months, will amount to a mini-trial involving much of the evidence collected by prosecutors as well as expert testimony from both sides. Although the posting did not say so, legal experts say it's likely that Zimmerman himself would testify since he is the sole survivor of the February 26 confrontation. ""Most of the arguments, witnesses, experts and evidence that the defence would muster in a criminal trial will be presented in the 'stand your ground' hearing,' said the statement posted on Zimmerman's official defence website. Under the law, Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester can dismiss the charges if Zimmerman conclusively shows he fatally shot Martin because he 'reasonably believed' he might be killed or suffer 'great bodily harm' at the hands of the unarmed teenager. Legal battle: Zimmerman, pictured right at an April 20 bond hearing, will fight the charges against him using Florida's 'stand your ground' law . Killed: Trayvon Martin was shot and killed the night of February 26 in Sanford, Florida, by George Zimmerman . The law also says a person has no duty to retreat in the face of such a threat. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, shot Martin after a confrontation in Zimmerman's gated community in the central Florida town of Sanford, where Martin was visiting. The case drew local and nationwide protests because Zimmerman was not arrested for weeks after the shooting. Evidence released by prosecutors, the Zimmerman statement said, shows 'clear support for a strong claim of self-defense.' The statement added that Zimmerman attorney Mark O'Mara 'urges everyone to be patient during this process and to reserve judgment until the evidence is presented in the `stand your ground' hearing.' Defence: Zimmerman is represented by attorney Mark O'Mara, centre, seen walking to the Seminole County Court . Martin's parents have contended that Zimmerman singled out their son as he was returning from a convenience store because he was black and that it was Zimmerman's aggression that led to his death. Zimmerman, who is free on $1million bail, faces a possible life prison sentence if convicted of second-degree murder. If his 'stand your ground' claim succeeds, however, the criminal charges would be dismissed and Zimmerman could not be held liable in any civil action such as a wrongful death lawsuit. Prosecutors would likely appeal a successful self-defence claim. A spokeswoman for special prosecutor Angela Corey declined comment. An attorney for Martin's parents did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. Evidence: Zimmerman has said that Martin broke his nose and slammed his head into the pavement, which corroborate with the Sanford police department's photos from that night . Legal experts have said that Zimmerman's credibility is a key to his claim and that he undermined his own cause by deceiving the judge about his finances during an April bond hearing. That alleged deception led to perjury charges against Zimmerman's wife, Shellie. She has pleaded not guilty. Lester, who will also decide the self-defence claim, said Zimmerman 'flaunted the system' by making misleading statements about how much money the couple had raised through online contributions from supporters. The judge revoked Zimmerman's initial $150,000 bond and had him returned to jail, then allowed him to be released on the higher $1million figure with additional restrictions.

ffcfdd57ee77edc262b904ad8cf9b2fb62de312e,"(CNN) -- The 28-year-old victim of an acid attack was released Sunday from a Portland, Oregon, hospital, a nursing supervisor said, nearly a week after an unknown assailant threw a cup of the caustic liquid in her face. Bethany Storro was released from Legacy Emanuel Hospital, where she had undergone surgery for her injuries after the attack last Monday, according to the supervisor, who declined to give her name. Storro credits a new pair of sunglasses -- bought just 20 minutes before the attack -- with saving her eyesight. ""God is watching over me,"" Storro, of Vancouver, Washington, told CNN affiliate KATU in Portland, Oregon, last week. ""I believe in him. That his hands are on me and I can't live the rest of my life like that -- in fear. I can't let what she did to me wreck my life."" Vancouver police say they are looking for the assailant, described as an African-American woman with an athletic build and slicked-back hair pulled into a pony tail. A composite sketch of the suspect was released last week. Storro told KATU that she had stopped at a Starbucks about 7:15 p.m. Monday, just after she had gone back to buy a pair of sunglasses that she had seen earlier. The woman walked up to her and said, ""Hey pretty girl, do you want to drink this?"" When Storro declined, the woman threw the contents of the cup in her face and ran off. Storro said she spoke about the attack because she wants people to see what the woman did to her and to help authorities find the woman before she assaults someone else. The attack bears similarities to a 2008 case in London, England. Katie Piper, a young model and television presenter, was leaving her apartment in a London suburb when she was attacked by a stranger waiting for her with a cup of sulfuric acid. The liquid burned the skin on her face, neck, chest and hands. She was also left blinded in one eye. Her assailant was asked by Piper's former boyfriend, Danny Lynch, to throw the acid on her face because she ended their short relationship. Both the assailant, Stefan Sylvestre, and Lynch are serving time in prison for the attack. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","28-year-old Bethany Storro was released from a Portland, Oregon, hospital Sunday .

Forget about demolishing that glass ceiling — women in the Senate are finally getting a much-needed update to their bathroom. Female senators have been forced to share a two-stall facility for 20 years, causing lines and headaches. But now that the Senate boasts 20 lady lawmakers, construction crews will expand the small bathroom after August recess, The Washington Post reported. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, tweeted the renovations were 'a sign of the progress we are making'. Historic: The Senate is getting a new, larger bathroom for this Congress' record number of female lawmakers . 'We’re even going to have a window,' Shaheen told the Post. Ever since their numbers increased, the small size of the bathroom—the only one located just off the floor—became a 'running joke' for the group of senators, the Post said. 'For the first time, there was a traffic jam in the Senate women’s bathroom,' Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said a week after the election according to the Post. 'There were five of us in there, and there are only two stalls.' Klobuchar added the increase in female senators was 'wonderful', adding the group has dinners every other month. The New York Times reported the group is even using the bathroom problem to their advantage. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat from Michigan, said that she and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota, strategized on a new farm bill while waiting in line. 'It’s a good problem to have,' Stebenow told the Times. 'We have enough of us now that we can negotiate in the ladies' room.' Women have come a long way since the first female senator was elected in 1922. Progress: Female senators have been forced to share a small, two-stall bathroom just off the Senate floor since 1993 . When Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington state, was sworn-in 20 years ago, females didn't even have the cramped bathroom. She told seattlepi.com that the only bathroom off the Senate floor was for men. 'We had to go upstairs and down a long hall,' Murray said. Eventually in 1993 a small, two-stall, restroom was constructed using space in from the men's facility, according to the Times. It was bearable when there were less than 10 female senators. 'It’s no longer convenient: There’s a line,' Murray told seattlepi.com. The women in the House of Representatives got their own update in 2011, when Speaker John A. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, directed the Architect of the Capitol to construct a female restroom adjacent to the House floor. Before construction, female representatives had to walk 'the length of a football field' for a toilet, according to the Times. 'It’s terrific to have this here,' Rep. Virginia Foxx, a . Republican from North Carolina, said when it opened. 'It’s a great facility for us to have after all these years . here.

A team of police disaster specialists will be sent to Ukraine to bring back the nine tragic Britons killed in the Ukrainian air disaster, Downing Street announced today. The Scotland Yard experts will join a Dutch-led emergency team after a request from the country's prime minister Mark Rutte. A separate team of air-accident investigators have been put on standby to help an international investigation into what caused the crash. Both operations depend on the pro-Russian separatists granting international access to the crash site. 'That’s why we are pushing so hard internationally to make sure that there is the access,' Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said today. Britain is pushing for a UN resolution granting access to international investigators to discover what happened . The plane came down in an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatists around the city of Donetsk . Number 10 this morning said getting to the site of the disaster was the Government's first priority. The UK has called an emergency session of the UN Security Council  to get international agreement for access. Moscow and the Russian rebels have both said they will back an investigation, but Downing Street said they needed to back up their words. A spokesman for Mr Cameron said: 'President Putin has said on this there should be an investigation. 'That is why we said very clearly that people should do all they can to enable that to happen - not just words.' At least nine Britons are believed to be among 298 passengers and crew who were on board the plane, which was apparently shot down by a surface-to-air missile. Mr Cameron chaired an emergency meeting of the Governent's crisis committee Cobra this morning to agree how to respond to the crash. A team of Scotland Yard specialists has been put on standby to help recover the bodies of the nine Britons killed in yesterday's crash . He was joined by the new Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and new Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. The Prime Minister's national security advisor Sir Kim Darroch and representatives from the secret services also attended. Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said this morning’s emergency meeting focused on the need for a 'swift and independent investigation' into the causes and securing access to the crash site for international experts. Mr Cameron spoke with his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte, the Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, and sent messages of condolence to Malaysian PM Najib Razak. The Prime Minister's spokeswoman said: 'Clearly it will be the Ukrainian government that are in the lead on this. We are keen to work with them closely and we think there needs to be an independent international investigation. 'So that would look to the role of people like ICAO, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, or looking into Air Accidents Investigation Branch. 'The point I would make is that the crash site is in a separatist-held area and therefore part of the work we are doing is talking closely to the OSCE [Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe], who are clearly the ones that have the monitoring mission in the broader region, about how we can work together and access [the site]. 'And it is also why we are pushing for a clear statement at the UN on the need for access.' Mr Cameron's spokeswoman added: 'The focus was on the huge tragedy that this is for the Netherlands, the need to have an independent investigation. 'It is true that this crash has taken place in the context of a wider crisis in Ukraine and one element of that [is] we have been sending a very clear message to the Russians, along with our European partners and the US, for several weeks now about the need for them to exert their influence on Russian separatists and stop the flow of weapons across the border.

Four civilians, three hotel guards and a policeman were killed in the battle. All five attackers were also killed. The attack, quickly claimed by the Afghan Taliban, again showed the ability of insurgents to stage high-profile raids. It came even as NATO nations prepare to withdraw most of their combat troops by the end of 2014 and leave Afghans to lead the fight. Afghans look at the dead bodies of two victims of the attack .

Battle: A NATO helicopter arrived (pictured) after bombers attacked the Spozhmai hotel at Qargha Lake late on Thursday night and continued into the morning . NATO attack helicopters could be seen over the single-storey hotel building and a balcony popular with guests for its sunset views, while a pall of smoke rose into air. The Taliban complained wealthy Afghans and foreigners used the hotel, about six miles from the centre of Kabul, for 'prostitution' and 'wild parties' ahead of today's religious day holiday. Launching their annual offensive this spring, the Taliban threatened to attack more government officials and rich Afghans. Bullet holes pepper the hotel's brickwork, along with smashed windows . But the hotel assault was one of few in which multiple hostages were taken since the start of the war, now in its 11th year. General Mohammad Zahir, head of the Kabul police investigation unit, said: 'This is a crime against humanity because they targeted children, women and civilians picnicking at the lake. 'There wasn't even a single soldier around there.' Television pictures showed several people wading out of the lake onto a balcony and clambering over a wall to safety.

Soldiers and police fanned out around the hotel at dawn, arriving in cars and armoured Humvee vehicles and taking cover behind trees flanking the lake and a nearby golf course. Police said they wanted to stage a rescue without resorting to a frontal attack that could kill the hotel guests who had been taken hostage. Qargha Lake is one of Kabul's few options for weekend getaways. Restaurants and hotels that dot the shore are popular with Afghan government officials and businessmen, particularly on Thursday nights. Guests at the Spozhmai must pass through security checks before entering the hotel, where tables with umbrellas overlook the water, but security is relatively light for a city vulnerable to militant attacks. Violence across Afghanistan has surged in recent days, with three U.S. soldiers and more than a dozen civilians killed in successive attacks, mostly in the country's east where NATO-led forces have focused their efforts during the summer fighting months. Fears: Afghan security officials stand guard on a road leading to the hotel . NATO commanders, halfway into the process of transferring security responsibility to Afghan forces, are racing through training for the Afghan army and police, including holding basic literacy classes for recruits. Several well-planned assaults in Kabul in the past year have raised questions about whether the Taliban and their al Qaeda-linked Haqqani network allies have shifted tactics to embrace high-profile attacks targeting landmarks, foreigners and Afghanistan's elite, extending a guerrilla war once primarily waged in the countryside. Afghan insurgents attacked Kabul's heavily protected diplomatic and government district on April 15 in an assault, eventually quelled by Afghan special forces guided by Western mentors, similar to one in September 2011. Militants also killed eight people in an attack on the upscale Intercontinental hotel in Kabul in June 2011.

The grand slam singles record holder, seeded as low as seventh after an indifferent 2013, had too much know how for Slovenian Grega Zemlja in winning 6-3 6-2 7-5. A shock second round exit at Wimbledon and injury concerns left many doubting 32-year-old Federer would be a major factor as he bids for this 18th slam. But in a match carried over from Monday due to bad weather, the Swiss maestro was always on top. His only hiccup came when he surrendered a break in the third set before eventually closing out the match on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court. He will play Argentina's Carlos Berlocq in the second round, with a possible quarterfinals against No.2 seed Rafael Nadal on the horizon. ""I felt great,"" Federer said. ""Day sesion or night session it doesn't really matter when you play on Arthur Ashe Court,"" he told fans. Top seed and world No. 1 Novak Djokovic made short work of his first round opponent, defeating Lithuanian Ricardas Berankis 6-1 6-2 6-2 in 81 minutes. The 2011 champion hit 28 winners in the match and dropped his serve in the third set, but recovered to break back in the next game to serve out a routine victory. Djokovic only needs to reach the semi-finals to retain his top ranking. He faces Germany's Benjamin Becker in the second round. Wimbledon semifinalist and 14th seed Jerzy Janowicz was knocked out in the first round at Flushing Meadows for the second year in a row, losing in straight sets to Argentina's Maximo Gonzalez. In the women's draw 2011 champion Samantha Stosur was stunned by 17-year-old Victoria Duval, surrendering a one-set lead to lose 5-7 6-4 6-4 to the 296th-ranked American. Duval, who lost in the first round of last year's event to Kim Clijsters, was delighted with her own performance. ""I think I played amazing today -- it was incredible, the whole match was just really an incredible match and I'm happy I pulled it through,"" the Miami-born starlet told the WTA's official website. ""Obviously it's a great feeling to beat a past champion. And Sam is amazing. Although she didn't play nearly her best today, I played amazing, so I'll take it!"" Former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki both withstood testing challenges from Asian players in their first round matches.

Wozniacki, being supported at Flushing Meadows by golfing boyfriend Rory McIlroy, had a slightly easier task against Chinese qualifier Duan Ying-Ying. But having won the first set 6-2, the Danish sixth seed trailed by a break in the second before recovering to close out it out 7-5. Another former No.1, Serbia's Ana Ivanovic, also showed good early form with a straight sets win over Georgian Anna Tatishvili 6-2 6-0.

Sarah Thomas, 46, is said to have been picking herbs from the garden of her villa in St Lucia on Christmas Day hours after returning from an all-night party with her husband Kevin, 36, when she slipped. Mrs Thomas, who had been married for five months, had given up a lucrative career as a City tax lawyer and was hoping to start a family. Sarah at her wedding to Kevin Thomas five months ago. She is believed to have lost her footing while picking herbs from the garden of her villa in St Lucia at 10am on Christmas Day . Police on the island initially said they were investigating whether there was any suspicion of foul play, but have now concluded it was a tragic accident. A post-mortem examination confirmed that Mrs Thomas died from head wounds from her fall. Yesterday her devastated parents William and Christine Pickering and sister Alison said they accepted the police findings and wanted her to be laid to rest on the island. ‘She will be buried in St Lucia, where her heart is,’ said Mrs Pickering, of Ashton-on-Ribble, Lancashire. ‘We wish to make it clear that there has been a full police investigation and we believe that Sarah’s death is just the result of a terrible accident.’ She added: ‘Sarah had been incredibly happy with Kevin. St Lucia was her home. She moved there in 2010 and had a wonderful wedding last summer.

They do say two heads are better than one, but workers at a turtle farm in the U.S. had never before seen anything like this. A two-headed snapping turtle has been discovered at the Northeast Ark Turtle Farm, in Amagon, Arkansas, in a shipment of 30,000 of the reptiles shipped from China. The baby turtle is yet to be named, but representatives at the farm have confirmed they will be looking for a new home for the young reptile. A two-headed snapping turtle has been discovered at the Northeast Ark Turtle Farm, in Amagon, Arkansas, in a shipment of 30,000 of the reptiles shipped from China . The baby turtle was discovered at the farm last week, according to The Jonesboro Sun. A state biologist has said turtle mutations are rare, but are becoming more common. Workers at the farm have previously discovered a hatchling with one neck and two heads, but that died at birth. Turtles from the farm are usually sold for educational and research purposes, an employee said. The two-headed baby, however, will probably be sold to a collector. Earlier this year it was reported that a two-headed mutant snake had been spotted slithering its way through a village in India. The baby turtle is yet to be named, but representatives at the farm have confirmed they will be looking for a new home for the young reptile . The snake, which was believed to be a checkered keelback, was seen crawling past a house in Burdwan, West Bengal. The non-venomous snake slithered onto Apurba Ghosh's patio, leaving him just enough time to capture the magical moment on his camera phone. And in a flash it was gone, wriggling into a bush before he had a chance to catch it. It was never seen again.","Two-headed snapping turtle discovered at turtle farm in Amagon, Arkansas .

Arizona officials say tourists should be able to return to Grand Canyon National Park on Saturday after the state along with several counterparts agreed to a federal government plan.But the Obama administration's OK to reopen parks closed by the government shutdown came with a big caveat: States must foot the bill with money they likely won't see again.So far, Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Arizona and New York have agreed. Governors in other states were trying to gauge what would be the bigger economic hit - paying to keep the parks operating or losing the tourist money that flows when the scenic attractions are open. The US state of Utah began re-opening its national parks like the Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon (pictured here) on October 11, 2013 after striking a deal with federal authorities . The Grand Canyon re-opened on Saturday after it was closed during the federal government shutdown . South Dakota and several corporate donors worked out a deal with the National Park Service to reopen Mount Rushmore beginning Monday. Gov. Dennis Daugaard said it will cost $15,200 a day to pay the federal government to run the landmark in the Black Hills.He said he wired four days' worth of the donations on Friday. In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state will pay $61,600 a day to fully fund Park Service personnel and keep the Statue of Liberty open. States like Utah decided to pay to keep parks open because the cost of losing tourism would damage the local economy . Even the bathrooms at the main entrance to Grand Canyon National Park were closed until Saturday . Arizona officials said a deal reached Friday will mean visitors should be able to return to Grand Canyon National Park on Saturday.Arizona Republican Gov. Jan Brewer balked at spending about $112,000 a day for a full reopening of the Grand Canyon. She said a partial reopening would be much cheaper while allowing tourists to visit and businesses to benefit.'The daily cost difference is enormous, especially without assurances that Arizona will be reimbursed,' said Andrew Wilder, a spokesman for Brewer. Park rangers had to explain to disappointed visitors that the park was closed . Visitors to Zion National Park take in the sights after the park re-opened . In the end, Arizona agreed to pay the Park Service $651,000 to keep the Grand Canyon open for seven days. The $93,000 a day is less than the $112,000 the federal government had said was needed to fund park operations each day.In additional to state money, cash provided by the town of Tusayan, just outside the South Rim entrance, and private business would also be included in the funding.At this time of year, the Grand Canyon draws about 18,000 people a day who pump an estimated $1 million a day into the local economy. The town of Tusayan, and area businesses have pledged $400,000 to help reopen the canyon, but Wilder said it was unclear if the Interior Department could accept private funds.In Utah, federal workers rushed to reopen five national parks for 10 days after the state sent $1.67 million to the U.S. government with the hope of saving its lucrative tourist season.Zion National Park superintendent Jock Whitworth said staff members began opening gates and removing barriers and expected to have the park fully operational Saturday.'This is a practical and temporary solution that will lessen the pain for some businesses and communities in Utah during this shutdown,' Interior Department Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement. New york will pay $61,000 a day to keep the Statue of Liberty open . It was welcome news for beleaguered shop owners in the small town of Springdale adjacent to Zion. Hotels have been vacant and rental and retail shops have seen sales plummet during the shutdown.'It's going to be awesome,' said Jenna Milligan of Zion Outfitters, an outdoor gear rental shop. 'A lot of businesses have suffered severely because of the government. I just hope it does stay open through autumn.'In Colorado, officials said a deal had been struck for the state to pay $360,000 to reopen Rocky Mountain National Park for 10 days to allow tourists to reach Estes Park. The visitors are needed to help the town recover from flooding.Just over 400 national parks, recreation areas and monuments - including such icons as the Grand Canyon and Yosemite - have been closed since Oct. 1 because of the partial government shutdown.More than 20,000 National Park Service employees have been furloughed, and lawmakers from both parties have complained that the closures have wreaked havoc on communities that depend on tourism.Interior Department spokesman Blake Androff said Thursday the government had no plans to reimburse states that pay to reopen parks. But members of Congress introduced legislation Friday to refund the money within 90 days.In Utah, Herbert estimated the economic impact of the federal government shutdown at $100 million in his state.","So far Utah, Colorado, South Dakota, Arizona, and New York have agreed to pay to keep parks open .

Britain's longest-serving soap actor used his fame to sexually assault starstruck girls after inviting them to his Coronation Street dressing room, a court heard yesterday. William Roache, 81, who has played Ken Barlow on ITV for five decades, preyed on fans in the 1960s, confident his celebrity status meant they would not complain, it was claimed. One 14-year-old was attending a talent contest when Roache led her into the men’s toilet and made her perform a sex act on him, Preston Crown Court was told. He later wrote her a letter enclosing a signed photograph to secure her loyalty. Scroll down for video . End of day one: Bill Roache leaves Preston crown Court with his sons James, Linus, and daughter Verity today, where he is accused of raping a child and five other sex offences . But following the exposure of serial . sex offender Jimmy Savile in 2012, a jury heard that five women, who . were aged between 12 and 16 at the time of the alleged offences, finally . felt confident enough to come forward. ‘You . may well conclude by the end of this trial that William Roache’s fame . and popularity provided not only the opportunity for his offending but . that it is one of the predominant reasons for his victims’ decades of . silence,’ prosecutor Anne Whyte, QC, told the jury. The . twice-married father-of-four went on trial yesterday accused of twice . raping a 15-year-old girl who lived close to his then home in . Lancashire. In addition, he is accused of indecently assaulting four young girls he met at Granada Studios in Manchester. In the dock: Coronation Street star Bill Roache is accused of two counts of rape and five indecent assaults dating back almost 50 years . Another . said Roache pushed his hands up her jumper, while two sisters – one as . young as 11 or 12 – who were invited into his dressing room, and given . lifts in his silver Rolls-Royce, claimed they were also sexually . assaulted. Immaculately . dressed in a dark blue three-piece suit and striped tie and with his . grey hair neatly trimmed, the widower arrived at court flanked by . his 49-year-old son, Linus, and his two children by his late . second wife Sara – 32-year-old Verity and her brother James, 28. Famous: Roache, pictured with youngest daughter Verity, is probably Britain's best known soap star, and the jury were asked to ignore what they know about his character Ken Barlow . At . the start of the trial, the judge, Mr Justice Holroyde, told jurors . they were likely to be familiar with Ken Barlow from television but must . distinguish between the character and the actor. Witnesses will include . fellow cast members Anne Kirkbride, who plays his on-screen wife . Deirdre, Chris Gascoyne, who plays his son Peter, and Helen Worth, who . plays Gail Platt, later Gail Tilsley. The . actor first attacked a 14-year-old who was attending a talent contest . at Granada Studios in 1965 and was invited to a dressing room by Roache . and other cast members, said Miss Whyte. She . alleged Roache – then 33 – led her into the men’s toilet and, without . speaking, made her perform a sex act on him before they returned to the . dressing room. He asked for the schoolgirl’s address and later sent her a letter and a signed photograph which she still has, the court heard. Later . that year, she claims Roache gave her a lift in his car where she . ‘believes’ another sex act took place. The same year, a 16-year-old girl . was at Granada Studios when Roache approached her in the ladies’ toilets and started to ‘fondle’ her breast, Miss Whyte said. In . 1967, the court heard, a 15-year-old girl who lived near Roache’s then . home was led by the actor into the bungalow he shared with first wife . Anna Cropper, forced on to a double bed and raped. Later that year, she agreed to go into a cottage he owned and once inside he allegedly raped her again. The . 15-year-old alleged rape victim was a virgin and told police she felt . ‘panic-stricken’ at Roache’s actions, which came with no attempts to . ‘kiss or sweet talk her’. Then . between 1968 and 1971, Roache allegedly groomed the two sisters . initially aged around 12 and 14 who would wait outside the studios. The . elder sister claims that one day Roache – still wearing make-up and . stage clothes from playing Ken Barlow – invited her into his dressing . room and without warning put his hand up her skirt. On . the same occasion, the jury was told actor Neville Buswell, who played . Ray Langton, asked the younger sister to touch him sexually, but she . refused. He has denied these claims. Case: Prosecutor Anne Whyte, centre, told the court Roache, behind her, had used his fame to attack young girls . Later, . Roache allegedly gave the younger sister, now 57, and a friend a lift . in his silver Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud and made her perform a sex act on . him. At one point, she told police, she stopped when a double-decker . bus drove past, but he replaced her hand and made her continue, later . giving her half a crown to get a bus home as he dropped them off. Miss . Whyte said all five kept quiet until an interview Roache gave to New . Zealand television in March last year. The husband of the younger sister . interpreted  comments Roache made in the interview as suggesting that . ‘in the old days young girls were throwing themselves at him and they . were all sexually active’. Allegations: The actor allegedly attacked two of the young girls in the toilets at Granada Studios in Manchester, the court heard . Attacks: The prosecution say the star enjoyed attacking girls ins in a risky place, 'using his position and fame to try and obtain a continuation of sexual gratification' Entrance: The star's security were forced to clear path through a crowd as he arrived at Preston Crown Court this morning . Arrival: Coronation Street Star Bill Roache walks to Preston Crown Court with children Linus (behind left), James (next left) and Verity (right) for the start of his trial, where he is accused of historical sexual offences . Support: Roache - who has played Ken Barlow for decades - arrived flanked by his security in front and his children behind . Roache’s comments ‘grated’ and he contacted a Sunday newspaper with a view to selling her story, the court heard. Meanwhile . the alleged rape victim contacted police that month after a . conversation in which her grown-up son expressed disbelief about victims . of Savile and former MP Cyril Smith taking so long to come forward, . Miss Whyte said. She told . him Roache had raped her as a schoolgirl and, at his insistence, she . formally reported it to police. Roache was arrested and charged with two . counts of rape, and following publicity over his court appearance the . other four alleged victims contacted police. 'The youngest told police . she had felt ‘intimidated’ because people ‘feel he is some kind of super . actor and they think he’s lovely and always “William Roache what a good . man he is”, you know, you don’t stand a chance if you went forward’. Roache, . who was arrested last May, denies any sexual contact with the girls, . telling police he had slept with many women but always with consent and . none was underage. On screen: The actor's on screen wife, Deidre, played by Anne Kirkbride, will give evidence during the four week trial, the court heard . However . Miss Whyte said the jury may be struck by the fact that while the women . did not know each other – apart from the sisters – they gave strikingly . similar accounts. Roache, of .

ffd2582e8fdd3896be0fee81b65b7f55be217b35,"(CNN) -- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Wednesday that those behind the deadly blast at Moscow's busiest airport were hoping, in part, to prevent him from attending the World Economic Forum. Speaking at the gathering of business and political leaders in Davos, Switzerland, Medvedev said, ""Those who committed the heinous act by aiming their blow against the citizens of various countries expected that their act would bring Russia to its knees, would force us to be defensive. They expected and hoped that the president of Russia would not come here to attend to this forum, among other things, of course. This is the criteria used to choose the time and place for committing that act of terrorism. ""But they miscalculated. Russia is aware of its place in the world, Russia is aware of its responsibilities to its citizens and will comply with them, and its responsibility to the world community. This is the reason why on this day I'm speaking from this rostrum."" The bombing Monday killed 35 people. Earlier Wednesday, Medvedev fired top airport security officials. He accused transport police of ""taking an absolutely passive position. At best, they are examining migrants, to check their registration and display their authority,"" in comments carried on Russian state TV. Among the people he dismissed was Andrei Alexeyev, the head of the Interior Ministry's transport administration for the Central Federal District, he announced in his televised remarks. ""If people don't understand how to work, we'll find other people,"" Medvedev said, according the RIA-Novosti news agency. Moscow is observing a day of mourning for the victims Wednesday, with flags flying at half staff. The government asked television stations to cancel entertainment programs as a mark of respect, RIA-Novosti said. ""We have to do all we can to influence, if not the ideology, then at least the social and economic roots of terrorism -- poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, parentlessness,"" Medvedev said in Davos. ""And we have to be sure that global development is stable, safe, and just and fair."" At the end of his speech, he announced that he was cutting short his previously planned stay in Davos to head back to Moscow. The blast occurred around 4:30 p.m. Monday at the entrance of Domodedovo Airport's international arrivals section. A day later, authorities were still trying to tally the exact number of people injured in the blast. RIA-Novosti said as many as 180 were hurt. The Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations said there were 110 wounded people still in hospitals. Medvedev blamed security violations. ""What happened at Domodedovo shows the airport lacked security,"" he said Tuesday. ""It's unbelievable that such a huge amount of explosives were brought into the terminal. Those officials responsible for security at Domodedovo must be punished for their decisions. This is a terror attack, a grief, a tragedy."" It is not yet clear what impact a recent decision to shake up the Russian Transport Police, which is charged with protecting train stations and airports, may have had on the security perimeter at the airport Monday. In August, Medvedev fired at least 12 generals in the Transport Police branch of the Ministry of Interior, as part of a broader reform of the Russian security services. Domodedovo is 22 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of Moscow and is the largest of Moscow's three airports, as well as the busiest in terms of passenger traffic. It was still not immediately clear who was responsible for Monday's blast. Previous terror attacks in Russia have been blamed on militants from the North Caucasus region. Over the past decade, bombers have hit trains and planes operating in and traveling out of Moscow at least four times, with a combined death toll of more than 100 victims. In 2004, two planes blew up nearly simultaneously after taking off from Domodedovo airport. That attack was linked to Chechen suicide bombers. An explosive device derailed an express train in November 2009, killing at least 26 people. Chechen rebels were blamed again. Medvedev has called on his government to do ""everything in order for the criminals who committed this crime to be established, found and brought to justice. And the nest where these bandits are hiding, whatever their name is, should be exterminated."" CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Ivan Watson contributed to this report .","NEW: Medvedev says the Davos forum was considered in the attack's timing .

A Chinese immigrant charged with killing her baby by eating rat poison while she was pregnant pleaded guilty Friday to a misdemeanor count of criminal recklessness as part of a deal with prosecutors. Bei Bei Shuai, 36, pleaded guilty to criminal recklessness and was sentenced to time served, which was 178 days, Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. Charges of murder and feticide were dropped. Curry said he decided to accept the lesser charge because a number of evidentiary rulings by the court had hurt the prosecution's case. He says he decided to accept the lesser charge rather than to appeal those decisions. Free woman: Bei Bei Shuai addresses the media after her accepting a plea deal in court yesterday . Ordeal: Bei Bei Shuai following her arrest for the murder of her three-day-old daughter Angel Shuai . 'There were evidentiary rulings that would have made our case difficult to proceed,' he said. 'We felt it was appropriate to resolve it with the plea and with some acknowledgement of culpability and everyone can move on.'A message was left at the office of Shuai's attorney, Linda Pence, by the Associated Press late Friday afternoon seeking comment. Prosecutors had argued that Shuai, a Shanghai native, killed her child by eating rat poison in December 2010, when she was eight months pregnant. Shuai gave birth to Angel on December 31. The baby died three days later. Legal support: Shuai (right) leans on her attorney Linda Pence following her release from prison on bail in 2012 . Landmark case: Shuai addresses supporters at a rally protesting her indictment . Among the rulings that hurt the prosecution's case was one in January when a judge ruled that Dr Jolene Clouse, who performed the autopsy on newborn Angel Shuai, didn't consider other possible causes for the brain bleeding that caused her death, including a drug that Shuai received while she was in the hospital.The case drew international attention from reproductive rights advocates who contended it could set a precedent by which pregnant women could be prosecuted for smoking or other behavior that authorities deem dangerous to their unborn child. Headline-making: Shuai's case gained the attention of reproductive rights advocates all over the world . About 80 organizations have filed friend-of-the-court briefs on Shuai's behalf, and more than 10,000 people from Australia to New York have signed an online petition supporting her.But Curry said those arguments weren't a factor in the case.'While well-intended, those assertions have been completely incorrect from the start. There was never any intention to monitor pregnancies. As has been pointed out on more than one occasion, Indiana appellate courts have already weighed in on those issues,' he said.The plea agreement states that the two sides believe the conviction 'will not trigger adverse immigration consequences,' and if it does the plea agreement will be set aside.The trial was scheduled to begin September 3.","Bei Bei Shuai, 36, pleaded guilty to criminal recklessness in a plea deal .

Apple's shares fell 5.4 per cent on Wednesday, following the launch of its new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C. The price ended at $467.24 before rising marginally to $467.71. Investors were put off by the £469 price of the iPhone 5C claiming it wasn't low enough for Apple to attract new customers . At an event in Cupertino on Wednesday morning, Apple's CEO Tim Cook and senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller unveiled two new handsets. The iPhone 5S is a high-end successor to the current iPhone 5 model and comes in gold, silver and slate, with a fingerprint scanner built into the 'home' button and starts at £549. The iPhone 5C, which before the event was rumoured to be Apple's first 'budget' handset, comes in a range of five colours and has the same screen and camera as the current iPhone 5 model. Cook also announced at the event that the firm would be discontinuing the iPhone 5 after the new handsets go on sale on 20 September. Rumours had suggested that the price of the bargain phone would be around £63, yet the handset price starts at £469, which industry experts claimed was still too expensive for low-end customers. Analysts also accused Apple of misleading customers by showing the handset costing $99 during the event, yet that price was on a two-year contract and monthly payments weren't announced. Around a third of the world's handsets are sold in China to half a billion people, yet only 12 per cent of these phones are made by Apple. Korean rivals Samsung is the leading smartphone manufacturer in the region, with Chinese brands including Huawei and Lenovo also popular. Apple is still a popular choice in China, but predominantly with the Chinese elite, and Carl Howe, vice president of Yankee Group's Consumer Research group told ABC News: 'Rumor has [Apple] that they make more money in any of the five stores in China than they do in the Fifth Avenue store in New York.' Apple phones in China cost around the same amount as the average person's monthly salary in urban areas, or three months wages for a bus driver, for example. The 5S is due to sell in China for 5,288 yuan (£547) and the 5C for 4,488 yuan (£464) and the handsets, which will be available from 20 September, will be launched in China at the same time as other major territories for the first time ever. Howe continued that although China is Apple's second largest market, there is a large percentage of the population that it is not able to attract. The phrase 'iPhone 5S' was the most popular search term on Sina Weibo, China's most widely used social network, on Wednesday, while 'iPhone 5C' didn't appear on the top searches list. Users questioned why anyone willing to fork out well over 4,000 yuan for a smartphone would not just pay a bit more for the premium 5S model. Apple's share of the China smartphone market slipped to five per cent in the second quarter, according to research firm Canalys, behind not just Samsung but also Lenovo, ZTE, Huawei and Xiaomi Technology. 'Even though Apple has a lower end iPhone now, its price is still considered mid-end in China and not low-end,' said Sandy Shen, a Shanghai-based analyst for Gartner. Around half of China's smartphone shipments are in the 700-1,500 yuan range, said Shen, but competing on those prices isn't an attractive prospect for Apple. 'Considering Apple's old rival Samsung and domestic players such as Huawei, Lenovo and Coolpad all have phones in that category, Apple will still lose out in market share in these key segments,' she said. No UK network operators have released contract pricing yet. 'Investors were put off that Apple's . price point didn't go low enough to attract a new market. It doesn't . have the same range in price that Apple's competitors have,' said Mark . Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in . Philadelphia. 'It doesn't have the same range in price that Apple's competitors have,' he added. 'We believe Apple is foregoing a valuable and relatively easy way to return to earnings growth.' Phil Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide product marketing, unveiled the iPhone 5C on Tuesday. In the U.S the device starts at $99 on a two-year contract yet experts have called this misleading because monthly costs weren't announced. When bought outright, the handset is $549, or £469 in the UK . Apple recently lost smartphone market share to main rival Samsung, dropping to 14 per cent - its lowest for three years - because of ‘lacklustre’ iPhone 5 sales and tougher competition from rivals. Analysts predicted that Apple would be looking to boost sales in emerging markets, such as China, and this was bolstered by the fact Apple held a mirror event in Beijing, and announced the iPhone 5S will also be made available in China at the same time as other countries for the first time ever. Rivals including Samsung and Huawei do well in emerging economies because their handsets are cheaper to produce, so cost less. To put this into perspective, the 5C will sell for 4,488 yuan (£464) in China, which is more than the average monthly urban income for the country. Apple's CEO Tim Cook, pictured, unveiled the iPhone 5C in California on Wednesday. Analysts predicted Apple would be looking to boost sales in emerging markets, such as China to rival Samsung and Huawei, yet the 5C will sell for 4,488 yuan (£464), which is more than the average monthly urban income for the country . If the drop in Apple's share price was to hold or remain low, the fall would be biggest single-day slide since 24 January. Still, . Apple's shares climbed 28 per cent between the start of July and Monday ahead of the launch as anticipation began building about the . company's next iPhone. Despite many investors being critical of the announcement, four others raised their target prices. Nomura Equity Research increased its target to $480 from $420, for example. Reaction among industry experts and consumers was mixed. Apple's profit for the quarter which ended on 29 June, fell 22 per cent as gross margins fell below 37 per cent from more than 42 per cent in the year-earlier quarter. UBS, which cut its rating on Apple's stock to 'neutral' from 'buy,' cited a survey of 35,000 Chinese consumers conducted by ChinaDaily.com that found only 2.6 per cent of respondents would consider buying the cheaper iPhone 5C. 'We worry that Apple's inability/unwillingness to come out with a low-priced offering for emerging markets nearly ensures that the company will continue to be an overall share loser in the smartphone market until it chooses to address the low end,' Sanford C. Bernstein analysts said in a note. MailOnline's Mark Prigg was given hands-on time with Apple's new iPhone 5S following Wednesday's launch: . 'Apple's iPhone 5S is without doubt an evolution rather than a revolution. 'Despite . this, the 5S is the best looking phone on the market, and the new . champagne cover is surprisingly nice - and thankfully not as bling as it . looks in some pictures. 'However, . the most obvious addition is the phone's fingerprint sensor, which . could render passwords and even bank PIN codes obselete. 'After . spending around 90 seconds teaching it your fingerprint by moving your . hand around, you simply tap where the home button is to unlock your . phone. 'It’s simple, and, in limited testing, works flawlessly - although there are doubts over its ability to cope with sweaty hands. 'For . anyone that has to use a passcode for their corporate email, the . fingerprint sensor alone is a huge timesaver. It's also very fast - . simply press to the home button, and the phone powers on and recognises . you in under a second. 'The . noticeably faster processor that makes it seem far snappier in use than 5 . is also a decent step forward, as it the entirely redesigned camera . which is a big improvement.'","Shares in Apple ended at $467.7 on Wednesday following the launch of its new iPhones - a drop of 5.4 per cent .

ffd31248d0202b88f22bc969b7007029d4606a42,"(CNN) -- Authorities regained control of a Kentucky prison early Saturday after inmates torched buildings, shattered windows and threw rocks at guards. Inmates set fire to a Kentucky prison on Friday after the warden said he would ease restrictions on a lockdown. Inmates at the medium-security Northpoint Training Center in Burgin started an uprising shortly after the warden announced he'd ease restrictions on a lockdown, Northpoint Public Information Officer Mendalyn Cochran told CNN. Two inmates were transported to hospitals with chest pains, she said, and there were no reports of hostages taken. The lockdown was instituted Tuesday, after about 10 to 15 inmates assaulted two others in a fight over stolen property, Cochran said. Warden Steve Haney told prisoners about 6 p.m. Friday of his plan to ease the lockdown, but 30 minutes later, fires began to spread through the dorm-styled institution, she said. Inmates were evacuated to the prison yard and authorities threw tear gas over the fence to subdue the prisoners, Cochran said. The damage to the facility was so severe that all the prison's 1,200 inmates had to be kept outside in a prison yard. ""There are several buildings in the front that will be a total loss,"" said Lt. David Jude of Kentucky State Police. An investigation will determine whether criminal charges will be levied against some of the inmates. Burgin is about 40 miles southwest of Lexington. CNN's Leslie Tripp contributed to this report.","Guards regained control of Kentucky prison early Saturday after inmate uprising .

""I was enamored with her from day one and I was like, I'm going to spend the rest of my life with her,"" Shandiz told the station. ""I would joke with her and tell her that when we get engaged, it'll happen on a Delta flight."" And that's exactly what happened. On Friday, in the middle of a flight from Chicago's O'Hare International to New York's LaGuardia Airport, Shandiz suddenly addressed a visibly shocked Williams over the plane's intercom (with the airline's permission) as other passengers looked on. The proposal was captured on a video posted on YouTube. ""From the moment I met her that night, I knew that I never wanted to spend a second without her,"" Shandiz announced as Williams rocked in her seat with emotion. ""Would you marry me?"" The cabin erupted in applause as Williams said yes. Shandiz then presented her with the ring and the couple kissed awkwardly in the cramped cabin. Delta treated all passengers on the flight with champagne to celebrate the engagement. It also surprised the couple with a free trip for their honeymoon, WGN reported.

A 1999 file image of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri, who served under Saddam Hussien's regime and who is still at large. ""We say to the people of Gaza, give more resistance and we will be with you in the field, and know that our victory in kicking out the invaders is your victory as well, because the main assailant on the nation and on Palestine is the American imperialism,"" the recording said. ""A salute to the martyrs of the massacre, and our condolences to their families."" Al-Douri's recording follows reports of a similarly defiant message from al Qaeda's deputy chief a day earlier. Ayman al-Zawahiri reportedly vowed revenge for Israel's air and ground assault on Gaza and called Israel's actions against Hamas militants ""a gift"" from U.S. President-elect Barack Obama. Israel is in the 12th day of a military operation against Hamas militants, who have been firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel. Al-Douri's 30-minute recorded message was broadcast Wednesday on al-Raei Iraqi satellite television over an old picture of al-Douri, wearing his Iraqi military uniform. CNN has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the voice on the tape. This is not al-Douri's first purported audio message. There have been at least four others over the past three years in addition to a statement attributed to him. Al-Douri, 66, served as vice-chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council. He remains at large nearly six years after the war in Iraq began. He has previously been reported killed and captured, although those reports later turned out to be erroneous. He was the King of Clubs (No. 6) on the U.S. military's card deck of most wanted regime officials. The U.S. military says he has helped finance the insurgency against U.S. troops in Iraq with Iraqi funds he transferred to Syria before Hussein's government collapsed in April 2002. But it says his influence has waned while he has been in hiding. U.S. officials say al-Douri played key roles in the chemical attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 and in putting down Kurdish and Shiite revolts after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.","Al-Douri was vice-chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council .

Brenda Heist, who was eventually . presumed dead by her husband and two children after suddenly going . missing from their Pennsylvania home, walked into the Alachua County Jail in Gainsville, Florida last Friday after violating her probation. The 53-year-old was released from jail a few weeks ago after being arrested for drug possession and driving with an expired tag in Pinellas County, Florida. Scroll down for video . Eleven years on the run: Brenda Heist pictured left at the time of her disappearance and right as she looked when she walked into a Florida police station last Friday . She gave police her alias Kelsie Lyanne Smith which alerted authorities that she was wanted in Pensacola for stealing a driving license. She was charged with forgery and giving a false name to police. Following her release, she did not report to her parole officer, according to WTSP leading to the warrant for her in Santa Rosa County. She will be transferred on Monday at the earliest to Santa Rosa County Jail. No bond has been set, authorities told ABC. It emerged this week that Heist had set up a new life as a Florida cleaner and never spoke about the family she left behind. Friends have spoken of their . shock at discovering who she actually was and lifted the lid on her . runaway life which was far less tragic than she has made out. For a time she lived happily in Florida, making money as a cleaner and living with friends.

'We're learning now that life wasn't so bad for her in some of her . friend's eyes, that are calling us today,"" Detective Sergeant Schofield, . who is leading the investigation, told the Lancaster Online. Sondra Forrester said: 'We were close, she was a friend, and we did things on weekends. We spent time at the beach, and fishing. She was around my three kids. She was very sweet. She called me sweetie. I felt bad for her. It sounded like she'd had a hard life. She said she was a widow, had no children, that her mother died when she was 6.'

Missing: The then 42-year-old was last seen dropping off her two children at school in Lititz, Pennsylvania . Heist worked as a cleaner in the Panhandle after hitch-hiking there with a pair of vagrants. She told police she was acting on a whim after suffering money problems and facing divorce. When building her new life she apparently told friends she had a husband who had died. She never revealed she . had two children left to grow up thinking their mother may have been . murdered. 'She didn’t want children, she didn’t like children and never had children. That’s what she told me,' the friend said. 'She spoke mostly about her husband and how much she really loved him and she was devastated that he died.' It was through work as a cleaner that she stole another identity - . lifting the driver's license of one of her housekeeping clients. When the deception was discovered she moved on again. Over the 11 years she is said to have three aliases.  She also went by Kelsei Smith and even served a short time in jail for identity theft when that was uncovered.

The heartfelt notes, many of which date back to the 1950s and 1960s, praise the crime writer for her epic novels and short stories and thank her for helping individuals through hard times. The horde of messages, which have been published to mark the 125th anniversary of her birthday, include a letter from author PG Wodehouse, as well as a note from a Polish woman in London, who told how one of Christie's novels helped her survive a war-time labour camp in Germany. Scroll down for video . A series of touching letters to novelist Agatha Christie (left) have been published to mark the 125th anniversary of her birthday. The messages, some of which date back to the 1960s (right), praise her novels . The woman explained in her letter how she exchanged a piece of candle for a Polish translation of Christie's novel, The Man in the Brown Suit. In her fan mail, she wrote: 'I read and re-read (it) so often that I almost knew it by heart. 'The first few pages were missing so I didn't know the title or the author but for seven months it was my only link with a normal world. 'I know your writings have given pleasure and amusement to millions of people all over the world but never can one of your books have meant more to anyone than that tattered Polish translation did to me.' Christie, who wrote 66 detective novels and 14 short-story collections, also treasured a 1958 letter from a 14-year-old boy in Bristol who started a book club at his school so he could raise funds to buy her work. 'I have bought 28 books by you and this is how I have managed it,' he wrote. 'I charge the boys 3d per book to read at school, and 6d if they wished to take them home. 'With the money I obtained . . . I bought more 'AC' books . . . Now my scheme is bringing in so much money, I can afford to buy one of your books a week.' One letter, dated August 1963, thanks Ms Christie for helping women prisoners escape in Romania (above) by writing her novels. The note references Christie's crime novels including Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple . In the five-page handwritten letter, he later told how he would be 'truly proud' to hold a response from Christie and said he would be able to show it to his children in years to come. He also asked the 'Queen of Crime' at what age she began writing and expressed an interest in knowing the background of her successful career. In her typed response, which Christie also kept a copy of, she replied: 'I was very interested in your letter. You seem to have had a very good idea and I congratulate you.' Christie, who died in 1976 aged 85, also saved a note from PG Wodehouse, the English writer best known for the Jeeves and Blandings Castle novels and short stories. His 1969 letter from New York stated that he was 'pleased and proud' after discovering she had dedicated a Halloween party to him and added 'a new Agatha Christie is always an event'. Praising her choice of title, Wodehouse also revealed that he found 'getting a satisfactory title is the most difficult problem'. Christie, who penned 66 detective novels and 14 short-story collections, also treasured a 1958 letter from a 14-year-old boy in Bristol who started a book club at his school so he could raise funds to buy her work . The young boy from Bristol said he would be 'truly proud' to hold a response from Christie and said he would be able to show it to his children in years to come. Christie replied saying she was 'very interested' in his note . The heartfelt letters (left), many of which were sent to the best-selling crime novelist's personal address in south Devon (right) have been published for the first time ever to mark the 125th anniversary of her birthday . Also in the collection is a letter written in 1963 by a woman who spent more than a decade in a Romanian prison with no access to books. She told the best-selling author: 'During the 12 years I spent in prison I never saw a written page. 'My memory, however, could not be sealed up and thanks to it and to you my fellow-sufferers came to know and to love the works of Agatha Christie.' Christie's grandson Mathew Prichard published a number of the letters and replies to mark her 125th anniversary and encouraged today's fans to share their experience of her writing. He said: 'Knowing what receiving these letters meant to my grandmother, I'm sure she would be moved to see these personal stories shared publicly for the first time. 'As we call to her fans across the globe to share their stories and experiences of Christie, I look forward to discovering how her work continues to inspire today.' Christie, who also wrote under the name Mary Westmacott, died aged 85 having written more than 66 detective novels, most famously featuring her creations Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple. Agatha Christie (pictured with her then young grandson, Mathew Prichard) wrote a total of 66 detective novels.

TV presenter Eamonn Holmes has been criticised for telling a rape victim: 'I hope you take taxis now.' Viewers of ITV's This Morning have reacted with outrage, claiming that Holmes appeared to blame the victim for making herself vulnerable. He made the controversial remarks during an interview with Hannah Cant, 20, who was raped by a stranger when she was 18. Controversial: Presenter Eamonn Holmes has been accused of 'victim blaming' following his remarks to rape victim Hannah Cant on live TV . She had been walking home from a night out in Chippenham, Wiltshire, when she was dragged into a car and subjected to a sex attack by soldier Jonathan Haynes. She had the presence of mind to tear out strands of her own hair and spit in the car to leave her DNA at the scene after seeing a similar tactic used on TV show CSI. She took the brave step of waiving her right to anonymity to appear on This Morning to speak about her ordeal a month after Haynes was jailed for at least 11 years. Holmes, 51, introduced the interview, saying: 'She was on her way home from a night out with her friends and walking home - didn't take a taxi. 'It's that old thing, I always say. Why were you tempted to walk home?' Brave: Hannah Cant appeared on This Morning to talk about being raped aged 18 . Miss Cant explained she had been with a friend and had walked the last two streets alone to her home as she had done many times before. She said: 'I thought it would be OK.' Holmes said: 'But it wasn't.' Miss Cant went on to speak of how she feared she would die during the ordeal, and then feared for her life after her attacker warned her not to go to the police. At the end of the interview, after thanking her for appearing, Holmes said: 'I hope you take taxis now. Everywhere you go, coming home at night.' He then turned and asked his wife and co-presenter Ruth Langsford: 'How many times do I tell people who I know to take taxis?' Hundreds of outraged viewers took to social media websites to protest, accusing the presenter of 'victim blaming'. Interview: Mr Holmes told Miss Cant she should have taken a taxi home before turning to wife Ruth Langsford, right, and asking 'How many times do I tell people to take taxis?' Philippa Willitts wrote on the blog of the women's rights site F-Word: 'The moral of the whole story was that, frankly, none of this would have happened if she hadn't dared to be outside, near her house, when a kidnapper and rapist was around. 'The victim-blaming attitude encompassed in that one sentence is as astounding as it is offensive. 'The truth is that women cannot win with attitudes like Eamonn Holmes's around. If we don't blame the perpetrator, things will never, ever change.' Others took to Twitter, expressing their views using the tags #victimblaming and #patronisingfatherfigure. @absinthetweets wrote: 'Hard to believe that Eamonn Holmes comment. Just hand-to-mouth-shocked-face awful.' Another commentator wrote online: 'I can't believe that they would ruin a brave woman's (most likely) harrowing interview by making such a flippant, dismissive and stupid comment.' Holmes apologised on air earlier this month after This Morning viewers complained at him branding celebrity guest Jonathan Wilkes 'retarded'. A spokesman for ITV confirmed they had received 26 complaints from viewers about Eamonn Holmes' comments since they were broadcast on Tuesday morning. But she said: 'Eamonn was in no way suggesting that the victim was in any way to blame for this horrific attack. 'His interview was carried out with the utmost care and compassion and his comments were intended to highlight safety advice. 'Hannah was happy with the interview and not in any way offended by Eammon's advice.'","ITV confirm his comments have sparked viewer outrage .

ffd574c8eaeaf1ba8d4382fcc942538249119667,"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A New York City minister who was the subject of an investigation about misspent 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina charity funds has agreed to repay $1,231,105 million in restitution. The Rev. Carl Keyes took hundreds of thousands of dollars from his congregation to buy an 18th-century farmhouse on seven acres in rural New Jersey, a BMW and travel. Rev. Keyes and his wife, the Rev. Donna Keyes, who jointly led the Glad Tidings Tabernacle in Manhattan, signed a legal judgment Wednesday settling a probe by the New York attorney general into a series of questionable church financial transactions. The Rev. Carl Keyes pictured speaking to an audience in Harrisonburg, Va. about his life experiences relating to his organization, Aid for the World in 2010 . Those deals included an illegal loan the couple took from the church in 2008 to buy a house in Stockton, New Jersey, near the Delaware River, and $500,000 the church loaned to an anti-poverty charity controlled by Carl Keyes, called Aid for the World. Some of that money, the attorney general's office said, was used to buy the minister and his wife a BMW. According to the settlement, which was scheduled to be officially announced Thursday, other funds were used to finance family trips to California, West Virginia, Africa and Florida, where the couple's sons went to college. Glad Tidings former executive director, Mark Costantin, agreed to repay $482,000 he still owed Glad Tidings on $1.2 million in loans he'd taken from the church, some of which were used to pay off the mortgage on his house in Chester, New York. 'Carl and Donna Keyes and Mark Costantin abused the trust of their congregants and used Glad Tidings Tabernacle as their personal bank,' said Attorney General Eric Schneiderman. He said the law forbids officers and directors, including ministers, from taking any such loans — 'much less loans to finance personal expenses and lifestyle choices.' Three former members of the Glad Tidings' board agreed to pay $50,000 in penalties for neglecting their oversight duties. Rev. Carl Keyes (center), founder of Aid for the World, seen ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange in 2009 . The attorney general's office began its investigation after the Associated Press raised numerous questions about Carl Keyes and two charities he controlled, including one that had received $4.8 million in donations intended to help victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina. The AP reported in articles in 2011 and 2012 that Keyes had diverted some of that money into his cash-starved church, then used funds from the church and the nonprofit groups to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal credit card bills and other debts. Keyes used one big donation, meant for his disaster-relief charity, Urban Life Ministries, to clear a mortgage on another New Jersey home. The AP also found that Keyes had embellished stories about relief work he performed in New York in the months after the 9/11 attacks. In some cases, he took credit for things that other people had done. Using a combination of internal documents and public records, the AP also chronicled how the church disposed of $31 million it made by selling off its historic Manhattan church in 2007. That report included detail on some of the loan transactions that were the subject of Wednesday's settlement. After the AP began asking questions, Keyes filed eight years of tax returns for Urban Life Ministries and three years for Aid for the World. State investigators said Costantin helped arrange for the church to lend nearly $1 million to the Keyes couple for their farmhouse purchase. The investigators added that Costantin signed paperwork in which the church gave up its right to claim ownership of the property if the loan wasn't repaid. No payments were made, the state said, and when the Keyes sold the house last year, they kept all the proceeds. A similar arrangement, approved by Keyes, took away the church's ability to collect on the loans to Costantin, the state said. New York law bars the officers and directors of nonprofit and religious organizations from taking any loans from their organizations. As a result of the legal settlement, Glad Tidings Tabernacle, now located in Harlem, has been placed under the temporary stewardship of a board appointed by an Assemblies of God umbrella organization. New York Assemblies of God District Superintendent Dr. Duane Durst said the organization planned to examine the church's finances carefully. The legal judgment requires the Keyes to pay $1,231,105 in restitution to Glad Tidings, which includes borrowed money plus interest. The Keyes couple and Costantin have been permanently barred from acting as fiduciaries of any New York nonprofit or religious corporation. The agreement allows Donna Keyes to continue to serve as senior pastor at Glad Tidings. The attorney who represented the ministers and Costantin, Maurice Heller, declined to comment. He said the settlement doesn't require his clients to admit guilt, but forbids them from making public statements contesting the allegations.","Rev.

ffd58aa8313d038dd657ecd811c31985ea417b47,"Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. His new book, ""Arsenal of Democracy: The Politics of National Security -- From World War II to the War on Terrorism,"" will be published this fall by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely about current events. Julian Zelizer says some of President Obama's political vulnerabilities have started to emerge. PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- June has been rough for President Obama. After experiencing enormous success during his first months in office, some of his political vulnerabilities have started to emerge. As Republicans begin to think about the 2010 midterm elections and moderate Democrats decide how they should vote on Obama's most ambitious initiative, health care, the White House must prevent these weaknesses from becoming debilitating. The first vulnerability is the tension between the left and center of the Democratic Party. Since his election, President Obama has struggled to navigate the divisions that exist between the liberal base of the party, who were the core of his early support, and moderate Democrats, who were also instrumental to his victory. At first, the administration relied on good will and political capital from the election to overcome conflicts, such as when Obama agreed to reductions in the size of the economic stimulus package to placate the conservative Democrats and some Republicans despite the objection of progressives. But the tensions are becoming more pronounced and more difficult to resolve. The president has disappointed gay rights activists for not fulfilling promises they thought he had made on the issue of gay rights. Last week, they expressed their frustration with the Department of Justice's legal brief supporting the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that prohibits same-sex partners from receiving marriage benefits and protects states that don't recognize same-sex marriages. Obama failed to calm the storm even when he extended some employment benefits to the same-sex partners of federal workers. He came under fire for having declined to provide health care and retirement benefits on the grounds that such a move would violate the Defense of Marriage Act. These kinds of left-center tensions will intensify when Congress delves into the final negotiations over health care this summer. Progressive Democrats insist that without a public insurance option health care reform will fail in the long run. Several Democratic moderates have been pushing alternatives that fall far short of that goal. The second vulnerability is the deficit. When Republicans have turned away from cultural issues and toward economics, they have been finding more success at attracting the interest of independents and moderates. Recent polls have shown that the public is concerned about the growing size of the deficit and Republicans have finally gained a bit of political traction by linking Obama's policies to the government's red ink. To be sure, this is not a home run issue for the GOP. Many commentators have pointed to the hypocrisy of Republicans making anti-deficit arguments following the tax-cutting and spending spree that took place under President Bush. Moreover, deficits have a poor track record in terms of being a winning campaign issue. There have not been any presidential candidates or major midterm elections in recent history that hinged on anti-deficit arguments. Many presidents, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, survived while growing the deficit. Polls have shown the public is also notoriously fickle about how much weight it gives to the deficit as an issue, and is often misinformed about the actual size of the deficit. Nonetheless, warning about rising deficits has been an effective tool for weakening the political strength of an incumbent administration. Regardless of the economics of the issue, with some respected economists saying short-term deficits don't matter, many Americans perceive the budget deficit as a symbol for whether a president is keeping federal spending under control. While Republicans might not take back Congress by focusing on the deficit, they can erode Obama's political standing and make it more difficult for him to pass legislation. Finally, there is the economy. The irony for Obama is that as the economy has stabilized, it has become a greater source of political danger. Without an immediate crisis, voters are not as panicked and don't feel as desperate for federal assistance. A growing number are more comfortable criticizing the administration's economic policies. Some Republicans have picked up on this and have asked why the U.S. needs to spend the stimulus money if the recession is almost over. At the same time, Obama is in a double bind: Most experts agree that we will have a fragile economy in the foreseeable future, so voters won't be happy either. If there is any new dip in the economy, the public will blame President Obama rather than President Bush. This is exactly what happened with the recession in 1937, which FDR's opponents called the ""Roosevelt Recession,"" using the downturn to diminish the number of New Deal liberals in the House and Senate in 1938. Does this mean Obama is finished? Not at all. The same polls that reveal vulnerabilities show that Obama is still extremely popular with the public and most evidence suggests that he has good standing with congressional Democrats. But in recent weeks a candidate who was once seen as invincible is now seen as potentially vulnerable. This is when the sharks start to circle in American politics. The revelation of weakness gives Republicans, as well as unhappy Democrats, more confidence to challenge the White House. This is not what the president wanted right as he is trying to win support for his health care proposal and the rest of his budget. If the problems are not contained, they can also become the foundation for the Republican campaign for Congress in 2010. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer:  June has been a difficult month for President Obama .

Jennifer Devereaux, a photographer from West Newton, was returning home from New York Monday when she says the 30-minute trip aboard JetBlue Flight 518 turned into a nightmare for her and her two daughters. The plane was sitting on the tarmac at John F Kennedy International Airport for about 30 minutes when Devereaux's daughter Summer said she needed to use the restroom. Scroll down for video . Nightmare scenario: Jennifer Devereaux (right) says when her 3-year-old daughter Summer (left) had a bathroom emergency aboard a JetBlue flight, she was yelled at and embarrassed by the crew . Family trip: The mother of two, a photographer from Newton, Massachusetts, was returning home from New York with her daughters when the incident happened . The mother asked a flight attendant if her toddler could use the bathroom, but in response the woman allegedly 'snapped' at Devereaux, ordering her to 'sit down.' But little Summer could not wait any longer and ended up relieving herself in her seat. ‘It wasn’t about bad customer service at that point, it was about bad human decency. My daughter was sitting in a pool of urine and I couldn’t do anything about it,’ Deveraux told CBS Boston. ‘And as a mom it just broke my heart.’ The married mother of two had no napkins or towels on hand, so she was forced to use her own sweater to soak up the mess. As she was trying to tidy up, Mrs Devereaux said the flight attendant yelled at her. ‘And I said, “Please give me a break. My daughter had an accident because you wouldn’t let me take her to the bathroom. After I clean it up I will sit down.” She turned around and reported it to the pilot,’ said Devereaux. Delay: JetBlue fFlight 518 (not pictured) was sitting on the tarmac in JFK for 30 minutes when her toddler declared she needed to go to the bathroom . As the plane was turned around and returned to the gate, the captain’s voice came on the PA system announcing that there is a non-compliant passenger who will be removed by security guards. Jennifer Devereaux, who was traveling alone with her two daughters, grew fearful, but fortunately for her an off-duty pilot who was sitting in front of her was able to convince his colleagues in the cockpit to let her stay. Verbal spat: when the mother of two asked a flight attendant if summer could use the restroom, the woman allegedly snapped at her and told her to sit down . Upon returning home to West Newton, the mother of two penned a complaint to the airline demanding an apology for the flight crew's behavior towards her family. JetBlue responded with a statement saying that they are investigating the incident. Mrs Devereaux also took to Twitter, saying that in the 10 years she has been flying JetBlue, Monday's trip was the worst experience of her life. She also called on the airline to fire the flight attendant, whom she identified as 'Karen,’ for treating her family 'like garbage.' The company tweeted back at Devereaux, apologizing for failing to provide her 'the JetBlue experience' and asking to hear more details. In a later tweet, JetBlue promised to have a customer representative reach out to her as soon as possible. ‘They can't treat kids and families like this,’ she told the station WCVB. ’It's completely crazy.’ Other Twitter users came to the mother’s defense, calling out the airline for the staffer’s conduct. Twitter tiff: The outraged mother demanded on Twitter that JetBlue fire the staffer who turned what was supposed to be a brisk 30-minute flight home into a nightmare . In response to a tweet by user Greg Zollo, who inquired if it was a normal operating procedure to have a 3-year-old pee in the seat, JetBlue responded that they are bound by very strict FAA regulations when a plane is on the tarmac. Jennifer Devereaux said JetBlue eventually offered her a $50 credit, but it will likely go unused since she has vowed never to fly with the airline again.","Jennifer Devereaux was flying from New York to Boston on JetBlue Flight 518 Monday with her two daughters .

A toddler died on her first day at nursery school when she was left to play alone on a slide known to be  dangerous, a court heard yesterday. Lydia Bishop became entangled in a ‘loop’  at the top of the slide. It tightened around her neck and choked her as she slid down. No children were allowed to be in the play area alone, but it was 20 minutes before the three-year-old was found by a member of staff. She was ‘blue’ and not breathing and efforts to revive her failed, Leeds Crown Court was told. Lydia died just five hours after being dropped off by her parents at the nursery at York College. Prosecutor Robert Smith, QC, told the jury there was a ‘tick-box mentality’ at the nursery, with staff focusing on ‘excellent’ paperwork rather than ensuring safety rules were adhered to. He added: ‘Compliance with health and safety law was done on paper but not in practice.’ Sophee Redhead, 25, was one of the nursery staff supervising Lydia and saw her walk in the direction of the slide, but did nothing to stop or supervise her, it was alleged. She denies manslaughter by gross negligence and an alternative health and safety charge of failing to take ‘reasonable care’ of the little girl. York College, which owns the nursery, is also on trial and has denied failing to ensure people not in its employment are not exposed to a risk to their health and safety. Scroll down for video . Incident: Lydia Bishop was found blue and not breathing after she got her neck caught in a rope on a slide in the outdoor play area at York College's nursery, pictured, Leeds Crown Court heard . On trial: Sophee Redhead arriving at Leeds Crown Court last week, has denied a charge of manslaughter over the death of the three-year-old girl . On the day of the tragedy in September 2012, staff had placed a makeshift barrier across the path leading to the slide in a ‘futile attempt’ to stop children going there unsupervised. The nursery regularly used ropes for play, but risk assessments had identified the potential danger of strangulation from rope attached to the slide. Strict rules – posted on the nursery walls – stated no  children should play on the slide without adult supervision and the rope should be put away when staff were not there. The tragedy happened when most of the children were enjoying a snack. Disturbing CCTV images played in court showed Lydia walking down the path at 2.05pm and climbing the steps to the slide. The camera – positioned behind the slide – shows ‘slight movement’ at the top and Lydia isn’t seen again. Almost 20 minutes later a member of staff realised Lydia was missing and asked Redhead to check outside. Sophee Redhead denies manslaughter by gross negligence and the alternative charge under health and safety legislation of failing to take 'reasonable care' of the little girl . Bosses: York College - which operated the nursery for children of staff, students and members of the public - denies failing to ensure people not in their employment are not exposed to a risk to their health and safety . Redhead is seen on CCTV at 2.26pm running towards the slide and carrying the lifeless girl back. Describing finding Lydia on the slide, she said: ‘Her head was about six inches from the top of the slide. As I got to the slide I could see that a loop of rope was round her neck.’ A doctor said Lydia could have recovered if she had been found after a few minutes. The trial continues.

ffd71ff78b7e5923c9257340388984e16bc4ef13,"America has reached a landmark point as, for the first time in its modern history, most of the babies being born there are non-white. White children aged under one are outnumbered by those from ethnic minorities including blacks, Hispanics, Asians and mixed race, US Census Bureau figures show. Of the four million children born in the US in the 12 months to July 2011, 50.4 per cent were from ethnic minorities. That compares with 37 per cent in 1990. The figures also reveal the prolonged impact of a weak economy, which is resulting in fewer Hispanics entering the U.S. Edging up: The percentage of total births in America has included more and more minorities over the past decade . Changing demographic: A chart showing the breakdown of racial and ethnic minority births for the 12-month period ending July 2011 compared to whites . Roderick Harrison, a former chief of racial statistics at the Census Bureau who is now a sociologist at Howard University, said: 'This is an important landmark. This generation is growing up much more accustomed to diversity than its elders.' In recent years, births have been declining for both whites and minorities as many women held off having children due to the economic slump, although the drop has been larger for whites. The report comes as the Supreme Court prepares to rule on the legality of Arizona's strict immigration law, with many states weighing similar get-tough measures. In flux: A bar chart showing the population projections for the U.S. over the next 40 years. Some now believe ethnic minorities will outnumber whites before 2040 . Mr Harrison said: 'We remain in a dangerous period where those appealing to anti-immigration elements are fueling a divisiveness and hostility that might take decades to overcome.' As a whole, the nation's minority population continues to rise, following a higher-than-expected Hispanic count in the 2010 census. Minorities increased 1.9 per cent to 114.1 million, or 36.6 per cent of the total U.S. population, lifted by prior waves of immigration that brought in young families and boosted the number of Hispanic women in their prime childbearing years. But a recent slowdown in the growth of the Hispanic and Asian populations is shifting notions on when the tipping point in U.S. diversity will come - the time when non-Hispanic whites become a minority. 'Dangerous period': Protesters campaign against Arizona's immigration law outside the U.S. Supreme Court, which is reviewing the state's controversial law . After 2010 census results suggested a crossover as early as 2040, demographers now believe the pivotal moment may be pushed back several years when new projections are released in December. The annual growth rates for Hispanics and Asians fell sharply last year to just over two per cent, roughly half the rates in 2000 and the lowest in more than a decade. The black growth rate stayed flat at 1 per cent. The immigrants staying put in the U.S. for now include Narcisa Marcelino, 34, a single mother who lives with her two daughters, ages 10 and 5, in Martinsburg, West Virginia. After crossing into the U.S. from Mexico in 2000, she followed her brother to the eastern part of the state just outside the Baltimore-Washington region. Identities: Census respondents choose their race by selecting either one option (ie- White alone) or more than one option (ie- White in combination). This chart shows the breakdown of those selections . Fewer white cities: This chart shows that only a handful of cities- like New York, San Diego, LA, San Francisco and Seattle- saw an increase in their non-Hispanic white populations over the past decade . The Martinsburg area is known for hiring hundreds of migrants annually to work in fruit orchards. Its Hispanic growth climbed from 14 per cent to 18 per cent between 2000 and 2005 before shrinking last year to 3.3 per cent, still above the national average. Marcelino says she sells food from her home to make ends meet for her family and continues to hope that one day she will get a hearing with immigration officials to stay legally in the U.S. She aspires to open a restaurant and is learning English at a community college so she can help other Spanish-language speakers. If she is eventually deported, 'it wouldn't be that tragic,' Marcelino said. 'But because the children have been born here, this is their country. And there are more opportunities for them here.' According to the latest data, the percentage growth of Hispanics slowed from 4.2 percent in 2001 to 2.5 percent last year. Their population growth would have been even lower if it weren't for their relatively high fertility rates - seven births for every death. The median age of U.S. Hispanics is 27.6 years.

Births actually have been declining for both whites and minorities as many women postponed having children during the economic slump. But the drop since 2008 has been larger for whites, who have a median age of 42. The number of white births fell by 11.4 per cent, compared with 3.2 percent for minorities, according to Kenneth Johnson, a sociologist at the University of New Hampshire. Blacks, who comprise about 12.3 per cent of the population, have increased at a rate of about 1 percent each year. In all, 348 of the nation's 3,143 counties, or 1 in 9, have minority populations across all age groups that total more than 50 percent. In a sign of future U.S. race and ethnic change, the number of counties reaching the tipping point increases to more than 690, or nearly 1 in 4, when looking only at the under age 5 population. The census report also found that four states — Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Texas — as well as the District of Columbia have minority populations exceeding 50 per cent. The census estimates used local records of births and deaths, tax records of people moving within the U.S., and census statistics on immigrants.

Three young children have been left without their mother after she was dragged by the driver of an SUV and run over in the street where the family lives. Kristina Purdin Dunn, 28, died in hospital on Monday after a horrific incident which was watched by her eight-year-old daughter Morgan. Mrs Dunn also leaves two sons - Jonathan, ten, and five-year-old Brandon. Her devastated husband Mike Dunn, 30, said the driver sped off after an argument about a $130 bill outside their home in Middletown, Ohio. In front of her family: Kristina Purdin Dunn, 28 (pictured with her five-year-old Brandon) was dragged to her death by the driver of an SUV in Ohio . Inconsolable: Mike Dunn tries to comfort his sobbing daughter, eight, who witnessed her mother's death from their home on Sunday evening . Mr Dunn was with his wife beside the truck and was arguing with driver Dustin Watkins who wanted  money for a paint job he had not finished, according to WLWT. As female passenger Maria Misquez screamed at Watkins to leave, Mrs Dunn's arm became entangled in a seatbelt, causing her to be pulled along beside the SUV before being run over. Police were called to the street at 9pm on Sunday where they found the mother lying on the ground bleeding from the head and not moving. Mrs Dunn was dragged 40 feet by Watkins, 27, who was behind the wheel of a dark green Chevy Tracker. Police have charged Watkins with  tampering with evidence, fleeing the scene of an accident and possession of drug abuse instruments. Misquez, 31, who owns the vehicle, was charged with complicity to . fleeing the scene of an accident. Distress: Ten-year-old Jonathan weeps over the death of his mother who passed away in hospital after being run over . Both were in custody in the local jail and due to appear in court later today. More charges may be brought when Mrs Dunn's autopsy is complete, according to police. Despair: Mike Dunn lost his wife who had been his childhood sweetheart . Watkins has been on the sex offenders' register since 2004 after an attempted unlawful sexual conduct with a female minor. Mrs Dunn had been airlifted to University Hospital on Sunday evening but later died. Cause of death had not yet been determined by the coroner. Mr Dunn, who works in construction, said he was trying to raise enough money to bury his wife while supporting his three grieving children. He said his children, in particular his daughter who watched her mother die from a window of their house, were traumatized by their mother's death. The couple were high school sweethearts and had been together for 13 years before marrying two years ago. Mr Dunn told the local TV station: 'My wife was killed for $130...

Marketing employee Qin Zhihui, 30, is believed to be the first person to be jailed since China's authorities announced a crackdown on online writers last August. Authorities claimed a false post he wrote about a foreign victim of a 2011 train crash receiving £24million in compensation was reposted more than 11,000 times and commented on more than 3,000 times, inciting anger against the government. Jailed: Qin Zhijun is led into court today in Beijing. He did not make a defence, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. China adopted draconian measures to crack down on online 'rumours' last year . Qin, from Hunan province, was also found guilty of spreading rumors . about several celebrities including popular television hostess Yang Lan, . the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Chaoyang District People's Court heard the rumours were spread in 2012 and 2013 through Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. China adopted draconian measures to crack . down on online rumours last year. People will be charged with defamation . if posts that contain 'rumours' are visited by 5,000 internet users or . reposted more than 500 times, according to a judicial interpretation . issued by China's top court and prosecutor. Confession: Qin issued a warning to other bloggers . Three years in jail is the maximum sentence. Qin Zhihui, known as Qinhuohuo in cyberspace, was arrested last August and accused of impacting society and seriously harming social order with his posts, according to Xinhua. But he made a confession to the court - and if he had not, would have been sentenced even more harshly. 'I don't want to defend myself,' he said, according to the South China Morning Post. 'I just want to say that I hope my experience is a lesson to other microbloggers.' The court heard he exploited sensational cases like one of a Red Cross staffer with a lavish lifestyle to drive web traffic, the Morning Post added. Other cases have also arisen. Today a Chinese-American venture capitalist known for his controversial blogs was released on bail after nearly eight months in detention because of a 'serious illness'. Charles Xue, also known as Xue Manzi, was detained in August on a charge of visiting prostitutes, an accusation that activists said stemmed from China's efforts to rein in social media. His release came the morning after state television showed him making a confession and apologising to his wife and children. China's crackdown on online 'rumour-mongering' is widely seen as a tool to halt criticism of the ruling Communist Party. It has chilled political debate, with high-profile bloggers saying they have reined in sensitive posts for fear of detention. The government claims the crackdown is necessary to preserve social stability.

ffd99713bc252af5531c6465014af9e5e1d9bd9e,"Strains of highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been found in river water downstream of a sewage treatment plant, scientists have warned. The contamination of the River Sowe, near Coventry, has sparked concern over the growing threat caused by superbugs that are resistant to ‘last resort’ antibiotics. The drug-resistant bugs were detected in samples taken by specialists from Warwick University near the Finham sewage treatment works. The resistant bacteria, which is carried in faecal matter, were strains of E.coli that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) - enzymes that can destroy many antibiotics including all penicillins. These microscopic images show a strain of antibiotic resistant bacteria found in the River Sowe near Coventry . ESBL infections are particularly dangerous because treatment options are limited and drugs need to be given by injection in serious cases. Study leader Professor Elizabeth Wellington, a lecturer in Environmental Microbiology at Warwick University, along with colleagues from Birmingham universities and the Health Protection Agency (now Public Health England), analysed sediment samples from upstream and downstream. They found bacteria resistant to important antibiotics used to treat a range of problems, including meningitis, septicaemia, and so-called hospital-acquired infections. They also found resistant E.coli were seven times more common downstream of a UK sewage plant than upstream. Their findings suggest resistance is spreading because of a gene called blaCTX-M-15 which bacteria collect to adapt to their environment. The researchers say stricter regulations and higher levels of treatment are needed to halt the rise in antibiotic resistance in the environment. Prof Wellington said: ‘If you disturb the sediment and then consume just 5ml of the water then you run the risk of getting gastroenteritis, which can make you extremely ill. ‘It would be like getting MRSA up your nose and could be untreatable. ‘If . the resistant bacteria colonised in your gut and through, say a urinary . infection, was able to leave the body, then the bacteria would be out . in the open, no longer just in the river sediment’ she added. The findings were published in the . Journal Of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy this month after the tests took . place between 2009 and 2011. Professor Neil Woodford, head of . Public Health England’s Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare . Associated Infections Reference Unit, said the extent of the health risk . caused by ESBL-positive bacteria was unclear. Professor Elizabeth Wellington, a lecturer in Environmental Microbiology at the University of Warwick said the bacteria could pose a threat . He said the agency was undertaking a three-year study to establish the variety of different strains in circulation. This is not the first time that antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been found in river water, he added. He said: ‘This finding causes concern although we have to keep it in perspective. ‘Just having had skin contact with the river water is not sufficient to cause illness. ‘For it to become a problem would require a particular chain of events to occur and the likelihood of these all happening needs to be borne in mind. ‘Our advice is that if anyone does become ill after swimming in rivers or streams then they should always advise their GP of their recent activities.’ A spokesman for Severn Trent Water, which runs the sewage plant at Finham, said: 'Severn Trent Water takes its environmental responsibilities extremely seriously. 'Earlier this month we received confirmation from our environmental regulator, The Environment Agency, that we have achieved a four star rating and leading company status for our environmental performance (we were the only company in the UK Water Industry to reach this standard). ‘The development of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria is without question an internationally important issue, and we are already engaged in increasing our knowledge to determine whether waste water treatment has role to play in this area. ‘In conjunction with all the other UK water and sewerage companies, we are actively involved in a multi-million pound national research project to look at the levels of pharmaceuticals in the sewage entering our treatment works.’ Antibiotic resistance is a growing worldwide problem, where common bacteria that cause infections are becoming resistant to drugs used to treat them. Antimicrobial resistance is a broader term, suggesting resistance to drugs to treat infections caused by other microbes as well, such as parasites, viruses and fungi. Many hospital-acquired infections including pneumonia and bloodstream infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Patients with infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria are generally at increased risk of worse health and death - people with MRSA are estimated to be 64 per cent more likely to die than people with a non-resistant form of the infection. Many hospital-acquired infections caused by highly resistant bacteria . As standard treatments become ineffective, infections persist which increases the risk of spread to others. Resistance to the treatment of last resort for life-threatening infections caused by common intestinal bacteria – carbapenem antibiotics – has spread globally and many countries lack basic systems to track and monitor the problem. The evolution of resistant strains is a natural phenomenon that occurs when microorganisms replicate themselves erroneously or when resistant traits are exchanged between them. But experts say the use and misuse of antimicrobial drugs accelerates the emergence of drug-resistant strains. This includes over-prescribing of such drugs – for example to treat viruses that do not respond to antibiotics – and easy over-the-counter availability in some other countries. Poor infection control practices, inadequate sanitary conditions and inappropriate food-handling encourages further spread. The use of antibiotics as growth promoters in cattle has also come under scrutiny. A 2014 report from the World Health Organisation says antibiotic resistance is no longer a prediction for the future; it is happening right now, across the world, and is putting at risk the ability to treat common infections in the community and hospitals. ‘Without urgent, coordinated action, the world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and minor injuries, which have been treatable for decades, can once again kill’, it says.","Strains of highly antibiotic-resistant bacteria found near Coventry .

ffdc1796fce660c89e239cafa887cdb71524feb5,"Michael Gove's exams watchdog has been accused of wasting public money by assessing whether the  new tests to replace GCSEs will  discriminate against Muslims, pregnant schoolgirls or teenagers having sex changes. The ‘equality analysis’, commissioned by Ofqual at a cost of £2,400, has warned that a number of pupils in these categories could be affected by the Education Secretary’s controversial overhaul of the exams. Mr Gove announced plans earlier this year to replace most of the course work and modular tests that pupils currently undertake as part of their GCSEs with more rigorous end-of-course exams, to be known as ‘I-levels’. Mr Gove announced plans earlier this year to replace most of the course work and modular tests that pupils currently undertake as part of their GCSEs with more rigorous end-of-course exams . Last year Prime Minister David Cameron declared that equality assessments were ‘bureaucratic nonsense’ and civil servants should employ common sense. But exam regulator Ofqual said it carried out the exercise to comply with the Equality Act 2010. It has spent over £5,000 on such assessments in the past year. Last night critics condemned the new report as a waste of time and money, only highlighting hypothetical effects on a tiny minority of the 600,000 pupils who will sit the new papers. Chris McGovern, of the Campaign For Real Education, said: ‘This is misplaced political correctness. We need common sense. We have been coping with exams from time immemorial. There are always going to be exceptions, and you can’t avoid them.’ Mr Gove said he was introducing his exam reforms to push up standards . Mr Gove said he was introducing his exam reforms to push up standards because the current ‘dumbed-down’ GCSEs had become discredited. But the Ofqual equality analysis, drawn up by a company called Equality Research and Consulting Ltd and published this month, warns that introducing a single, final exam worth 100 per cent of the marks could have an impact on teenagers who get pregnant while studying for GCSEs. It said schoolgirls who are expecting babies could struggle if the examination  season ‘coincides with any problems in pregnancy or is near the due date’. Concern was also raised in the  25-page report that pupils undergoing ‘gender reassignment’ may be disproportionately affected. The youngest person to have a sex-change operation in Britain is reported to have been 17, and fewer than 90 children and adolescents nationally are thought to be referred annually to the specialised gender identity services. However, the report says that reassigning a person’s sex by ‘changing physiological or other attributes of sex can be a prolonged process, rendering the pupil unavailable at crucial times not only for lessons but for exams unless alternative arrangements are made’. The third group, Muslim pupils, who make up less than ten per cent  of those taking GCSEs, could also be disadvantaged if they happen to  be fasting for religious reasons during the exams. Ofqual admitted in its main consultation document that the numbers involved were often small, but said it wanted to take all potential discrimination into account to see if alternative arrangements could be made. Ofqual said it was important to understand ‘the potential implications of any significant proposals we make for different groups. ‘Doing an equality analysis like this allows us to make decisions in a fully informed way, and also to meet our legal duties under the Equality Act.’","Course work and modular tests that pupils currently undertaken as part of GCSEs will be replaced with more rigorous end-of-course exams .

ffdc4163e773723fe857bf3ad19eca630824c5c2,"Children from the poorest families start primary school almost two years behind academically, Nick Clegg warned today. The Deputy Prime Minister said the academic gap between toddlers from different backgrounds can impact on them for the rest of their lives. A £50 million fund is being launched to help boost the academic achievements of nursery schoolchildren from poor families. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, pictured visiting Foresters Primary School in London last week, warned action was needed to stop children falling behind even before they start school . The Early Years Pupil Premium will be aimed at three and four year olds and will be worth around £300 per child. It is based on the pupil premium which is already paid to primary and secondary schools for each child from a low income family. Ministers argue the extra cash will improve the quality of childcare in nurseries, so all children starting school at the age of four are at a similar level of academic ability. Mr Clegg said: 'Every child deserves the chance to fulfil their potential, and this extra funding is a boost to help our youngest children get on in life and succeed. 'Boys and girls from poorer families have often already fallen 19 months behind their better off classmates by the time they hang up their coat on the first day of school. ‘Increasing their chances of success has got to be a top priority.' Nurseries will be able to decide how to use the money, the Department for Education said. A consultation is being launched on exactly how the money will be spent. Education minister Elizabeth Truss, pictured with London Mayor Boris Johnson, said nursery children should need more help with language and communication skills . Education minister Elizabeth Truss said: 'Children from low income families are already behind their peers in language and communication by the age of five - this is not good enough. 'We expect nurseries will use this money to create more high quality nursery provision led by teachers. 'We know it's a challenge to close the attainment gap later on but with the introduction of the Early Years Pupil Premium we hope it will prevent this gap from emerging in the first place.' 4Children chief executive Anne Longfield said: 'There is a real opportunity to use the announcement today as a springboard to maximise the impact of the free early years and childcare places for two-year-olds and the early years pupil premium for three and four-year-olds, and direct support to the most vulnerable pre-school children in a coordinated way that makes a real difference. 'We also think there is a real opportunity for children's centres to be much more involved in delivering this. 'The Early Years Pupil Premium needs to be increased during the next parliament to the same amount per head as a primary school child would be allocated. As we approach the next general election the challenge is for all political parties to set out how they will provide the support we know families need towards making Britain great for children and families.'","Toddlers from low income families struggle with communication skills .

ffdc7bca03f3554731599048f83fa79aa45e8884,"(CNN) -- Southwest of Toronto, in a satellite city called Mississauga, Ma Yansong's vision of a flowing, organic architecture halts the tedium of a relentlessly box-shaped cityscape. His two residential towers are alike in their sinuous curvilinearity -- which enraptured locals nicknamed ""Marilyn Monroe"" -- but were designed separately. The first tower was so beloved by Missisaugans, a second was commissioned and completed last year. Since winning this first big international commission in 2006, Ma's eight-year-old Beijing firm MAD has made a name for itself as a leading exponent of urban design that's both futuristic and respectful of nature. Their projects include breathtaking museums and towers in the Chinese cities of Harbin, Ordos and Tianjin, but Canada's Absolute Towers are Ma's favorite. He was only 30 years old when his design was commissioned. ""I'd never built a building before, and that was a huge building. I had to figure out how to assemble my team, how to build a high rise. It was a surprise. I didn't know it was so complicated to make a building,"" he said. View a hi-res gallery of Ma Yansong's 'Great Buildings' Achieved with the help of Toronto architect Atilla Burka and structural engineer Sigmund Soudack, the first tower is 170 meters tall, with elliptical floor plates that twist at varying points depending on corresponding features in the landscape. Today, Ma says he's glad he didn't know how difficult it would be to execute his vision -- he might not have tried if he had. ""I was so confident about what I proposed, because I was thinking about the city."" The city appreciated it. ""Architecture lives in Mississauga at long last,"" wrote one critic, who compared the building's sashaying, ribbed shape to the pleated, body-draping garments of fashion designer Issey Miyake. Another critic deemed it ""sassy, sexy and irreverent toward the formal pieties of cereal-box skyscraper modernism"", and a comeback to ""Toronto developers who complain that they can't build and sell anything except the same boring stuff we've been seeing since the Second World War. ""I didn't try to make it sexy, just not a box,"" Ma says. ""I'm trying to express nature in big cities. I grew up in the old neighborhood of Beijing where you had a courtyard and trees. Actually, the whole of Beijing was a garden -- the Forbidden City -- and the lakes and gardens in the city center were all artificial,"" he said. Watch 'Great Buildings' on Connect the World . ""I think that's a good pattern for future cities. There must be a way to combine the high rise and high density environment with nature. Maybe we can have our gardens in the sky. We can link different buildings in the sky, and we can have a waterfall in a high rise. It would be beautiful."" The building Ma most wishes he had designed is the Salk Institute by Louis Kahn who, like Ma, studied at Yale. Located in La Jolla, California, the building was commissioned by the inventor of the polio vaccine, Dr Jonas Salk, who wanted to create a place where scientists could be inspired. Kahn designed two parallel buildings with protruding towers which afford space for study. The six-storey structures are separated by a light-filled, marble plaza with a central water channel leading out toward the Pacific Ocean. iReport: Your favorite buildings . The building's use of concrete is widely praised, but Ma says he particularly likes its relationship to its environment. ""When people are in the central plaza, they feel so connected to nature, to the sky and the ocean, emotionally. I always imagine in 100 or 200 years, when people go there, they will feel the same,"" he said. ""I went there two or three years ago for the first time. I arrived there at midnight so I had to climb into the place, and was guided out by security. ""It was in the dark, so it looked different from the pictures -- everyone knows these pictures; you have the building on both sides and the ocean and sky in front -- but in the evenings, it's like a black hole,"" he says. ""The end is a void and it's horizontal not vertical, so you don't feel you're small and helpless. When you're in that space you feel you're the center, and you can talk to your future.""","Chinese architect Ma Yansong's favorite design is the Absolute Towers in Mississauga, Ontario .

Photojournalist Steve, 33, said: 'We were there partly for a holiday and partly for work. 'I was there to do a story on Dugongs that still frequent the area and my wife joined me just to enjoy the island. 'My favourite picture is the one where my wife, the snorkeler, is right in the centre of the school of jacks.

He added: 'Whitney was amazed by this school of jacks and how close they were to the beach. 'She wants to go back. I think she was more excited swimming with these fish then I was photographing them. Steve estimates that there were over a thousand fish in the school and were so close, you could touch them . 'They were very close, you could basically touch them. The fish just all hung around the whole time we were in the water. 'It's very hard to tell but there must have been over a thousand.

A fund set up by a Sunderland supporter in memory of the two Newcastle fans killed when flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in July raised more than £33,000. The teams face each other for the first time on Sunday since the clubs joined forces in tribute to John Alder and Liam Sweeney, who died on their way to watch the Magpies play in New Zealand. Newcastle manager Alan Pardew has called for supporter calm ahead of Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby . Newcastle fans clashed with police after the 3-0 defeat by Sunderland at St James' Park in April, 2013 . Newcastle fans pay tribute to the two supporters that lost their lives in the Malaysian Airlines disaster . The Tyne-Wear derby has been heavily policed in recent seasons amid fear of trouble and in April, 2013 Newcastle fans - following a 3-0 home defeat - clashed with law enforcers as they rampaged in the city centre. One man was later jailed for punching a police horse. Pardew, though, senses an effort to make the fixture about the passion on the pitch rather than vitriol in the stands. ‘I am hearing the right stuff on the radio and in the street about the levels of antagonism between the two clubs dying down a little bit to what it's really about – a football match. I am really pleased about that and hope it carries through to Sunday,’ he said. ‘I said two years ago that this nasty hate – those kinds of words – needed to go out. It’s a rivalry, a game of football, may the best team win and then we shake hands and go home. John Alder and Liam Sweeney were on board flight MH17 on their way to watch Newcastle in New Zealand . One Newcastle supporter was arrested for punching a police horse . Pardew said the last thing the North East should be doing is fighting each other . ‘The last thing the North East should be doing is fighting each other. But, at the same time, we know it's a massive rivalry and the passion of the game shouldn't be lost.’ There has been suggestion that Newcastle fans could applaud during the 33rd minute of the match in a show of thanks for the money raised for charity by the JustGiving fund. And Pardew added: ‘The incident with the Malaysian flight has definitely helped build bridges and we need to carry on doing that. ‘The way the Sunderland fans contributed and the effort they made has made great steps to help this fixture become what it should be, a spectacle for the North East. Not something where we have to order extra police.’ Sunderland boss Gus Poyet suggests that alcohol should not be sold on the day of the Tyne-Wear derby . Pubs in Newcastle, meanwhile, have confirmed that they will not be serving alcohol before 10am. That is three-and-a-half hours before kick-off and Sunderland boss Gus Poyet would rather drink was banned entirely on derby day. ‘You want a friendly derby? Don’t sell alcohol (throughout) the whole day in Newcastle and maybe you’ve got a chance,’ he said. ‘But if you’re going to let everybody go to the pub and you want them to behave, you’re a little bit naive.

It plans to partner with hifi firms to create speakers for the service, and today revealed it will already work with speakers connected to a TV. Scroll down for video . The update allows users to control music on their compatible speakers from a mobile phone . Google Audio cast works with the following apps: . Deezer, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, NPR One, Pandora, Rdio, TuneIn, and many others. However, key services, including Spotify, are currently missing. Currently the system allows people to play back video from sites such as Netflix. However, Google is now bringing the same technology behind its popular $35 Chromecast dongle into speakers, soundbars and A/V receivers. It says users will be able to 'cast' audio wirelessly from a variety of apps on your Android or iOS smartphone, or the Web, in a similar fashion to the way people with a Chromecast stream video. 'Just like Chromecast, simply tap the cast button in your favorite music or radio app on Android, iOS, or the web, and select a Google Cast Ready speaker to get the party started.' Similar to the video service, users can use their phone to control the music, which is then played directly through the speaker from cloud services, meaning they can use their phone for other things. 'Google Cast Ready speakers pull content directly from the cloud, so you’ll get the best audio quality and can freely multi-task on your phone, tablet, or laptop, all without straining the battery,' it says. The service is available from today, and Google's speakers will work with a growing list of apps including Deezer, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, NPR One, Pandora, Rdio, TuneIn, and doznes more. The $35 gadget, which resembles a USB stick, is plugged directly into the HDMI port on modern TVs and streams content from the web, via peoples phones, tablets and laptops. All this content is controlled via apps, and the European version of the stick currently features content from the BBC, YouTube and Netflix, while the US version has a host of apps. Chromecast is a direct competitor to the Apple TV system that was launched by the Cupertino company in 2007, and is now in its third generation. It also rivals the streaming box services of Roku. By comparison, Roku boxes start at £60 ($99), while the Apple TV device sells for £99 in the UK and $99 in the U.S. Chromecast is compatible with Android smartphones and tablets, as well as Chrome and Apple's iOS operating system. However, some major streaming services, including Spotify, are currently missing from the list. Google intends to broaden the Google Cast ecosystem over the coming months by bringing it into more televisions, game consoles, and set-top boxes with Android TV. The company is also working to enable other non-audio apps to enhance the experience by supporting Google Cast Ready audio devices. For example, you might be able to see a video on a tablet, but hear the audio on a set of bedroom speakers.","Will allow users to 'cast' audio to compatible speakers and hifi systems .

ffde4d37de2223c55f0edb22143b388de2ba5071,"(CNN) -- If you set your alarm this morning for quarter-past ungodly (California time) to catch the predawn announcement of the Oscars nominations, then we're in the same twisted little club. The Order of the Oscars Freaks. Years before Oscars handicapping became an official Olympics sport -- What? It's not? -- two fellow Oscars-obsessed friends and I made an annual game of trying to predict who'd get nominated. I never won (I tied once), but I never lost my enthusiasm for it; that is until every magazine and website came along with their own predictions and took the fun out of it. This year for old times' sake we revived our game, only doing the best actor category because it's been an impossibly full year of great male lead performances that have stumped the prognosticators. My 14-year-old nephew Miles was in on it because he's been a rabid Oscar fiend since he was at least, oh, 12. Call out a category -- best actress say -- and a year -- 1966 -- and he'll holler back ""Julie. Christie, not Andrews."" Am I proud, or concerned? Today the results came in and we all tied with four corrects each, but with different names on our lists. Jude must have known Christian Bale had the gale winds of ""American Hustle"" at his back. David, a great strategist, and Miles the Scorsese devotee, both recognized Leo DiCaprio's high standing with the Academy, even if Miles won't be seeing that film anytime soon, I pray. We all had faith in Bruce, Matthew and Chiwetel (funny how we know them all by first name.) I held out for Robert Redford because, well, he's Redford, and because I'm un-young. That should teach me to stop leading with my heart. But did anyone ever imagine that betting against Mr. Oscars himself, Tom Hanks, could pay off? If I had I would have won for once. Of course, Oscar mania is not just about the horse race. It's also the spectacle, the show around the show. The history. I'm a diehard. I haven't missed an Oscars since I got hooked as a teen. My favorite year was 1978, the night Jane Fonda and Jon Voight took the best leads categories for ""Coming Home."" Justice! Glory! As a professional plower of the fields of celebrity, with a license to fawn and gush (want to see my card?) I've attended the Oscars, been inside the crimson cocoon, felt the collective shock when ""Shakespeare In Love"" beat ""Saving Private Ryan"" for Best Picture. I've stepped on a few gowns. Not even the cruel realization that there are essentially two red carpets -- velvet stanchions separate the stars on one side from the rest of us attendees -- could squelch my blind and blinded-by-the-flashbulbs enthusiasm. But like most true believers I have my moments of doubt. If you are not in our little club, I get where you're coming from. To the Osc-nostics it is all too much, too little, and certainly, should you try to slog through the entire three-and-a-half hour ceremony on March 2, too late. It is kind of preposterous: over-hyped, over-scored, overwrought. In poor Oscar's defense, for the past decade or so Hollywood's big night has had to suffer indignities that the Academy of Old couldn't have imagined: dwindling viewership, the cultural-relevance supremacy of TV over movies, an attention deficit that just can't sit still for the live-action shorts category, acting and directing victories basically pre-called by critics and Tweeters and bookies, James Franco. There's desperation in the air. Oscar's been trying too hard. This year's host Ellen Degeneres will take care of some of that, I'm sure. You never see her sweat. Plus, there's red carpet fatigue, as the Oscars limp on high heels to the finish line of a bloated awards season as overextended as Christmas and the NFL. Critics' awards, the People's Choice Awards, the Golden Globes, the SAG Awards â€” you can only cut to a reaction shot of Jennifer Lawrence so many times before it constitutes stalking. But is it Oscar's fault that everyone else wants in on the action? I recognize the madness -- struggle with it -- but it's hopeless. I just can't shake my addiction. Will I sound like I'm on the Academy's payroll if I argue that the Oscars really are a great national tradition? Movies, of course, which might actually be getting better. And stars, our collective guilty delight. And glamor, maybe even a modicum of sophistication. And there are less-lofty traditions to savor: Carping about his speech, dissing her dress. Trying to catch a loser register a little disappointment. Enduring campy production numbers with aerialists. Dutifully filling out the ballots at your friend's Oscars party even if the only movie you saw that year starred Adam Sandler. It's all part of the ritual. The knowing that it's all too much, but the kind of too much that some of us just can't get enough of.

ffde6072b1663817b1abe8673b2ac245d46d175e,"(CNN) -- Yes --- Marissa Mayer posed for Vogue. Her skin is creamy, her hair perfect. She looks gorgeous. It's not surprising; it's Vogue. It's also not surprising that the conversation about Mayer's Vogue piece -- the first major profile she agreed to since becoming CEO of Yahoo -- has remained squarely focused on how she looks in the accompanying photograph. Most criticisms, my own included, have examined Mayer's role in this: At a time when women in the workplace desperately need role models, why did she allow herself to be depicted in a manner so far removed from most women's realities? On CNN.com, Pepper Schwartz writes that ""a significant number of women ... were less than thrilled at the idea of one of the few women of real power still needing the affirmation of a Vogue fashion shoot,"" and ""here's a woman who has made it to the top because of her brains, does she still need to self-validate by having a beautiful fashion gig?"" But what's so inexcusable about a woman wanting to look her best? How is it self-validating to let a respectable magazine profile you in the way they know how? Or is the issue more about the audacity of a powerful woman sitting for a portrait that might be -- gasp -- flattering? The truth is that we can't blame Mayer, or Vogue, for society's obsession with, and response to, appearance. Women, especially women who happen to be both beautiful and brilliant like Mayer, are very often reduced to, or at least measured by, their looks. This was a reality before Mayer's Vogue spread, and it will be a reality after. The debate over Mayer's culpability in agreeing to be sexed up for a fashion magazine implies that she has some power over the fact, some ability to change the truth, that looks matter, and that pretty people succeed more. Because they do, with or without the ""affirmation of a Vogue fashion shoot."" According to a 2007 paper from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, overweight and obese white women face a significant ""wage penalty."" According to research by Daniel Hamermesh, author of ""Beauty Pays: Why Attractive People are More Successful,"" the top one-third of attractive females earn about 10% more annually than those in the bottom sixth of the genetic pool. And in her groundbreaking 1999 book, ""Survival of the Prettiest,"" Harvard Medical School psychologist Nancy Etcoff argues that good-looking people get better jobs, are better paid, and have an easier time in life. The evidence is in: Evolutionarily speaking, pretty people win. Mayer's looks likely helped her get ahead in some manner throughout her career; as such, it's unreasonable to expect that she'd do anything but agree to play them up for a national audience. For women, who are faced with any number of disadvantages in the workplace, why not use what you can? That's not to say Mayer isn't brilliant or hardworking; it's not an either/or in business or in life. But it's unrealistic, and unfair, to expect that Mayer wouldn't sit for a photo that wasn't expected to turn out at least somewhat flattering. That's not self-validation, or even narcissism. It's nothing more than completely human. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Peggy Drexler: Talk of Marissa Mayer's Vogue piece focused on her appearance .

ffde6b21a87d7e4a8e88aa05fbc3c12a740bb828,"By . Ben Spencer for the Daily Mail . If your walls are covered in your child’s drawings, they may be worth a closer look. Because artistic talent early in life provides an indicator of intelligence later on, scientists have found. Children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, according to a paper published today. Psychologists at King’s College London studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four-year-olds. Those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later. Scroll down for video . Children who can depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, a study by King's College London has found. Drawings of more than 15,000 children were graded for the study . Each drawing was given a grade between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. The scoring system ignored features such as proportion for the study . The research, conducted on 7,750 pairs of identical and non-identical twins, also found a strong link between genetics and artistic talent. Identical twins were much more likely to draw pictures of a similar quality than non-identical twins. Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, said: ‘Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life. ‘Through drawing, we are attempting to show someone else what’s in our mind. 'This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species’ ability to store information and build a civilisation.’ However, she added: ‘But this does not mean parents need to worry. It is really important that parents do not think, “Oh no, my child is terrible at drawing, they will be flipping burgers for the rest of their life.” Each drawing was given a mark out of ten. The one on the left was given a four while the one on the right a ten . More than 15,000 children, all aged four, were asked to draw a picture of a child for the King's College study . There are countless factors, both genetic and environmental, which affect intelligence in later life. ‘Drawing ability does not determine intelligence. The findings show there is a link, but it is only a moderate link.’ The children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child. Each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. The scoring system ignored features such as proportion, but the children were given a point for including clothing. The children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing, and again at the age of 14. The researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores. While some drawings received a 0 (left), others were marked up because of their knowledge of features (right) Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London (pictured), said of the study: ‘Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life' Dr Arden added: ‘There is no evidence that drawing makes you more intelligent. But I think drawing will make a child more observant and able to pay attention to what is around them. ‘Children love drawing; give them a crayon and let them get on with it.’ Her team also tested the link between genes and artistic talent, using twins because each pair has a similar background, allowing the scientists to disregard outside influences. 'Overall, drawings from identical twin pairs were more similar to one another than drawings from non-identical twin pairs. Dr Arden said: ‘This does not mean there is a drawing gene – a child’s ability to draw stems from many other abilities, such as observing. 'We are a long way off understanding how genes influence all these different types of behaviour.’ The research is published in the journal Psychological Science.","Children who can depict human form at age of four more likely to be brighter .

Ukip is preparing for a ‘vicious, insulting and borderline libelous’ attacks from the Labour party in the run-up to the European elections, Nigel Farage revealed today. The Ukip leader said he now expects to make the biggest electoral gains in Labour’s industrial heartlands, when he predicts an onslaught from Ed Miliband’s party. It comes after Labour revealed it has hired a dedicated official to monitor Ukip’s activities. Ukip leader Nigel Farage said his party now stood to make the biggest gains against Labour . A new YouGov poll today puts Ukip on 10 per cent. It includes 13 per cent of people who voted Tory in 2010, 10 per cent of Lib Dems and 4 per cent of Labour supporters at the last general elections. Labour and Ukip are to go head-to-head in the battle to come first in the European elections on May 22. The Tories are widely expected to come third. Mr Farage told MailOnline he is prepared for a panicked Labour party to descend into dirty politics. ‘The untold story of British politics is that we are hammering working class votes and the Labour party has only just begun to wake up to it,’ Mr Farage said. Labour's Douglas Alexander said the party did not underestimate the threat posed by Ukip . ‘We are now the working class party. The upside potential for Ukip now comes more from Labour than anywhere.’ He said he would be focussing resources and campaign spending on the Midlands and northern seats where Labour dominates. ‘They will be vicious, insulting and much of what they say will border on libellous. They will have they trade union bully-boy friends helping them. They have got unite against fascism groups lobbying outside our meetings. ‘We know all too well how the Labour party will behave.’ It comes as Labour  revealed it has dedicated staff working on countering the threat from Ukip. Douglas Alexander, the party’s election –co-rindator and shadow foreign secretary,  said: ‘I take Ukip very seriously. The truth is that Ukip presents an electoral challenge to all political parties. ‘The way to defeat Ukip is not to be a better Ukip but to be a better Labour Party,’ he told The Independent. ‘That means making sure the EU works better for Britain but also tackling the cost of living crisis, promoting jobs and growth and protecting the NHS. ‘We have got staff dedicated to exposing the gap between the rhetoric of Ukip and its record. Inevitably, Ukip’s policies will come under sustained scrutiny in the weeks and months ahead.’ UKIP Director of Communications Patrick O'Flynn: 'Labour has finally woken up to the fact that the UKIP message is resonating in working class communities. 'Ordinary working families increasingly realise that the Labour Party no longer stands up for their interests and that only UKIP offers a solution to the uncontrolled immigration that is compressing wages and placing pressure on schools, hospitals and other public services.'","Labour election guru Douglas Alexander reveals fear of Ukip threat .

ffde7918386e9e87453fc2e83095fd6c3c8f8fc8,"Spoon thieves are getting a chance to redeem themselves and get a free plate of food at the same time. Mexican restaurant Wahaca is offering an amnesty to light-fingered diners who keep stealing their spoons by giving away tacos for the safe return of their colourful cutlery. The street food chain is giving people until the end of January to recoup some of the 4,000 spoons stolen each year. The restaurant chain, which has 16 outlets in London, has just opened an outlet in Cardiff . But those returning spoons on 1 February will not be eligible for free food. Wahaca, which was co-founded in 2005 by Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers, has outlets in 16 London locations and one in in Cardiff. The company is offering a free bowl of tacos to any customer willing to walk into one of their restaurants and hand back their sought after brightly coloured plastic spoons. The amnesty was first launched in  2012. The restaurant has since recovered approximately 100 spoons a year since they started offering food for spoons. Wahaca spokesperson Oli Ingham, 32, said to MailOnline: 'What we tend to find is that people are more nervous at the very beginning of the year. 'A trickle come in the beginning and when they find that we really are forgiving them, more start coming towards the end of the month.' Every year, Mexican restaurant Wahaca has 4,000 of its colourful spoons stolen from its restaurants . According to Mr Ingham, the first couple of years were slow. But he is expecting a better response this time round. 'We are expecting it to be a lot higher this year. People seems to be getting behind the idea each time we do it and we try to spread the word a little further around every time.' The Mexican standoff has led to Wanted posters being put up online by the street food company. The posters state: 'Sure, they're irresistibly bright and some say ergonomically perfect. True, there's no finer ladle for your last mouthful, but please, PLEASE can we have them back? Cardiff assistant general manager Rebecca Jones said: 'Four thousand people a year steal our spoons because they are quite fun and different. The amnesty was first launched in 2012. The restaurant has since recovered approximately 100 spoons a year since they started offering food for spoons . 'We remain convinced that the good customers of Wahaca wouldn't pocket anything underhandedly, and reassure ourselves at every stockcount, that most of our spoons are simply being borrowed. 'Which is why we're giving you another chance to seek absolution, by joining the Mexican Spoon Amnesty this January.' To receive a free plate of tacos customers  who visit the restaurant in January simply have to return any stolen spoons to their waiter before ordering. But those who try to return the cutlery in February will not be entertained. 'It's a one month only  amnesty. Our love has its limits,' Mr Ingham said. 'Those who are more honest and haven't stolen spoons can still get free food,' he continued. 'They just have to sketch a cutlery crime fighting souperhero, snap and share their #SpoonCartoon online to enter.'","Wahaca restaurant amnesty held throughout January .

ffde9e4779e4c71cb1b9b2716860c9864c133ed7,"""'God is great,'"" the Taliban militants shouted as they roared through the hallways of a school in Peshawar, Pakistan. Then, 14-year-old student Ahmed Faraz recalled, one of them took a harsher tone. "" 'A lot of the children are under the benches,' "" a Pakistani Taliban said, according to Ahmed. "" 'Kill them.' "" By the time the hours-long siege at Army Public School and Degree College ended early Tuesday evening, at least 145 people -- 132 children, 10 school staff members and three soldiers -- were dead, military spokesman Gen. Asim Bajwa said. More than 100 were injured, many with gunshot wounds, according to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province Information Minister Mushtaq Ghani. The death toll does not include the terrorists who attacked the school, bursting into an auditorium where a large number of students were taking an exam and gunning down many of them within minutes, Bajwa said. ""They started shooting indiscriminately,"" Bajwa said, ""and that's where maximum damage was caused."" Pakistani Taliban spokesman Mohammed Khurrassani said the militants scaled the school's walls around 10 a.m. (midnight ET), intent on killing older students there. The Taliban had ""300 to 400 people ... under their custody"" at one point, said Khurrassani, whose group is called Tehreek e Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.  But Bajwa said there was no hostage situation, as the attackers' focus was shooting to kill rather than taking captives. They were eventually met by Pakistani troops who pushed through the complex building by building, room by room. By 4 p.m., they'd confined the attackers to four buildings. A few hours later, all the militants -- seven of them, according to Bajwa -- were dead. Pakistani authorities spent Tuesday night inside the school in Peshawar, a city about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from the country's capital, Islamabad, looking for survivors, victims and improvised explosive devices planted to worsen the carnage. As they searched, they discovered that the school's principal was among the terrorists' victims. The attack drew sharp condemnation from top Pakistani officials, who vowed that the country wouldn't stop its war against the Taliban. ""We are undeterred. ... We will not back off,"" Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told CNN. But he said the ambush at the school is another example of how great his nation's sacrifices have been in fighting that's raged for more than a decade. ""Even the children are dying on the frontline in the war against terror,"" he said. ""The smaller the coffin, the heavier it is to carry. ... It's a very, very tragic day."" What do the Pakistan Taliban want? Minister: Most of the dead were 12 to 16 years old . On a typical day, the Army Public School and Degree College is home to about 1,100 students and staff, most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar, though others attend as well. Their nightmare began in late morning, when a car exploded behind the school. Pakistani education minister Muhammad Baligh Ur Rehman explained to CNN that the blast was a ruse, meant to divert the attention of the school's security guards. It worked. Gunmen got over the walls and walked through where students in grades 8, 9 and 10 have classes and fired randomly, said Dr. Aamir Bilal of Peshawar's Lady Reading Hospital, citing students. They came in with enough ammunition and other supplies to last for days and were not expecting to come out alive, according to a Pakistani military official. Seventh-grader Mohammad Bilal said he was sitting outside his classroom taking a math test when the gunfire erupted. He fell into bushes before running to the school's gates to safety. Ahmed, the 14-year-old student, remembered being in the school's auditorium when four or five people burst in through a back door ""and started rapidly firing."" After getting shot in his left shoulder, the ninth-grader lay under a bench. ""My shoulder was peeking out of the bench, and somebody was following,"" Ahmed recalled. ""They went into another room, (and when) I ran to the exit, I fell."" Bajwa told reporters that Pakistani security forces reached the school 15 minutes after the attack began. They found, he said, ""the children ... drenched in blood, with their bodies on top of each other."" Most of those killed were between the ages of 12 and 16, said Pervez Khattak, chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is the capital. But some adults in the school also were targets, like a 28-year-old office assistant who was shot and then burned alive, police official Faisal Shehzad said. Obama: Pakistan attack shows Taliban 'depravity' Violent past . Pakistan has seen plenty of violence, much of it involving militants based in provinces such as South Waziristan, North Waziristan and the Khyber Agency -- all restive regions in northwest Pakistan near Peshawar along its border with Afghanistan. It is the home base of the TTP, an organization that has sought to force its conservative version of Islam in Pakistan. The group has battled Pakistani troops and, on a number of occasions, attacked civilians as well. Peshawar, an ancient city of more than 3 million people tucked right up against the Khyber Pass, has often found itself in the center of it all. Militants repeatedly targeted the city in response to Pakistani military offensives, like a 2009 truck bombing of a popular marketplace frequented by women and children that killed more than 100 people. And the Taliban hasn't hesitated to go after schoolchildren. Their most notable target is Malala Yousafzai, who was singled out and shot on October 9, 2012 as she rode to school in a van with other girls. The teenage girl survived and, last week, became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to promote education and girls' rights in Pakistan and beyond. Yousafzai was ""heartbroken by this (latest) senseless and cold blooded act of terror in Peshawar,"" saying Tuesday that ""innocent children in their school have no place in horror such as this."" ""I call upon the international community, leaders in Pakistan, all political parties -- everyone -- (to) stand up together and fight against terrorism,"" the 16-year-old added in another statement. ""And we should make sure that every child gets a safe and quality education."" Growing up scared in Peshawar . Taliban: Revenge for killing of tribesmen . Still, even by Pakistan and the Taliban's gruesome standards, Tuesday's attack may be the most abominable yet. This is the deadliest incident inside Pakistan since October 2007, when about 139 Pakistanis died and more than 250 others were wounded in an attack near a procession for exiled former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, according to the University of Maryland's Global Terrorism Database. Even the Taliban in Afghanistan, with which the TTP is closely affiliated, criticized the ""deliberate killing of innocent people, women and children (as being) against Islamic principles"" and expressed condolences to the attack's victims, according to spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid. It comes after peace talks between the Pakistan Taliban and Pakistan's government as recently as last spring.  The government released 19 Taliban noncombatants in a goodwill gesture, in fact. But talks broke down under a wave of attacks by the Taliban and mounting political pressure to bring the violence under control. Inside militants' secret tunnels in Pakistan . In September 2013, choir members and children attending Sunday school were among 81 people killed in a suicide bombing at the Protestant All Saints Church of Pakistan. A splinter group of the Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility, blaming the U.S. program of drone strikes in tribal areas of the country. And for the past few months, the Pakistani military has been conducting a ground offensive to clear out militants, spurring violence that's displaced tens of thousands of people and sparked deadly retaliations. Khurrassani, the Pakistan Taliban spokesman, told CNN that the latest attack was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen during repeated army operations in provinces including South Waziristan, North Waziristan and the Khyber Agency. The TTP spokesman challenged that ordinary citizens were targeted, saying that five army vehicles are routinely stationed at the school. ""We are facing such heavy nights in routine,"" Khurrassani said, rationalizing the siege shortly before it ended.

It's not unusual for a British couple to escape the rat race by moving to France - but how about going back 75 years in time as well? Barry and Caroline Selwood have sunk every penny they have into creating their own shrine to the decades either side of the Second World War. But it doesn't end there, because the self-confessed eccentrics live as if it's the summer of 1939, complete with period clothes, furniture and a car all from the era. Vintage style: Caroline and Barry drive a cream Sunbeam Talbot Ten in celebration of a bygone era . Unique time capsule: The couple have re-built a dilapidated riverside hotel in south west France . As it was: La Belle Epoque hotel in south west France as it first looked . Blast from the past: Barry and Caroline, pictured in France, both enjoy dressing in vintage clothes . Perfect spot: The hotel had been abandoned back in the 1950's in the beautiful village of Nanteuil-en-Vallee . 'I guess they think we're just that crazy English couple who run the hotel.' It all started in 2002 when stationery salesman Barry decided his life was going nowhere. He sold his home in Stevenage, Hertforshire, and headed for France where he'd worked on yachts on the Cote d'Azur as a young man. He bought a tumble down farmhouse and set to work, but just a few months later on a trip back to England he met and fell for Caroline from Wokingham, Berkshire. Barry said: 'I'd decided to give up on the rat race, I had a comfortable life as a salesman, but I wanted something different. 'I was working on my farmhouse which I loved, but I loved Caroline too. Luckily she made it easy for me and wanted to be with me in France.' The couple found they both shared a passion for all things vintage. And, after a six-month-long distance relationship, Caroline gave up working as a nanny in London and moved to France. They married five years ago. Stepping back in time: The pair visited vintage events to find authentic items to decorate the hotel . 'We never really thought about how we'd manage,' Caroline said. 'We were young, carefree and in love and had a new and exciting life ahead of us.'The couple took seven to complete the renovation on the farmhouse. They knew their future lay in France and they loved their life in their home complete with swimming pool, but something was missing. 'We needed to find a property we could make into a business so we could support ourselves and live a sustainable life,' said Caroline. Then four years ago they saw a dilapidated hotel which had been abandoned back in the 1950's in the beautiful village of Nanteuil-en-Vallee in the Charente. Caroline said: 'It was love at first sight. It had been stood empty for four years and was derelict and forlorn. 'There were holes in the roof, water had been getting in for years and had taken a heavy toll. Pretty unique: 'There isn't anything like it in the UK where vintage living is more popular', says Caroline . 'We quickly realised we'd spent a large amount of our savings on a pile of rotten timber, collapsed ceilings and mouldy walls! 'And it soon became apparent the renovation budget we'd scribbled down over a couple of bottles of wine was total fantasy.' Work started and for the first couple of years the couple felt like they were 'chipping away at a mountain with a toffee hammer'. Things ground to a halt when Barry was installing a new staircase and he fell, shattering his arm, breaking his nose and a rib. Despite the setback things eventually took shape and the pair knew what the hotel's theme would be. They'd visited vintage events in the UK whenever they could and had been hoarding items. 'But France was a fantastic hunting ground for furniture and paraphernalia, as were local brocantes,' said Barry. 'We trawled eBay for bits and pieces, some of which were perfect and some we got after auctions that ended at midnight. It became madness!' Adding to the experience: The couple have just opened a tea room - and thankfully the bookings are coming in . Blowing the budget: 'We really didn't want to compromise. We wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago', says Caroline . Caroline added: 'We really didn't want to compromise. We wanted the house to appear how it would to people staying here 80 years or so ago. 'We found it really satisfying to put a piece of furniture bought a couple of years before in the place we'd imagined it would go once we had finished the renovation. 'Now it's pretty unique thing in France and there isn't anything like it in the UK where vintage living is more popular.' To help the business they've just opened a tea room too, to add to the whole experience. And thankfully the bookings are coming in. 'If we could go back in time, would we do the same again? Absolutely yes!' said Caroline. 'If we knew how much it would cost, then ""No!"" we'd never have started. 'But our advice to anyone in similar circumstances is ""Go for it!"" And if you happen to be installing a new staircase make sure it's properly secured before you venture up it!'","Barry and Caroline Selwood worked on the intensive project for four years .

ffe05db12f2b5c1c8b16a40a21c2fad2790e7cd0,"(CNN) -- Spring has sprung and as far as golf fans are concerned, that means only one thing -- it's time for the Masters. Golf's first major of 2014 begins at the famed Augusta National on Thursday, this year marking the 78th installment of one of sport's most enduring contests. They are four captivating days in Georgia that never fail to throw up a myriad of storylines, sub plots and sensations. With the field as wide open as ever, CNN World Sport looks at six Masters headlines waiting to be written. Mickelson assumes Tiger's mantle . The buildup to any major championship is always dominated by Tiger Woods -- whether he is playing or not. Even Phil Mickelson has said it will be ""weird"" not to have Woods prowling Augusta's fairways. With the world No. 1 missing his first Masters due to a back injury, most homegrown fervor will focus on ""Lefty,"" the man who already has three green jackets in his wardrobe. The 43-year-old has had his own fitness worries, withdrawing from two tournaments this season, but returned his best finish of the year at the Shell Houston Open just a few days ago. The only current player who can hold a candle to Mickelson in terms of Masters success is Woods, whose four Augusta titles match the feats of Arnold Palmer -- two behind the record haul of another legend of the game, Jack Nicklaus. Mickelson's most recent triumph came in 2010 and featured a shot that has gone down as one of the finest in the tournament's illustrious history. It also showcased Mickelson's game perfectly, as he launched a six-iron from pine needles behind a tree onto the 13th green, over the stream that protects the front of the green. Should Lefty find his very best this week, a fourth Masters crown is a distinct possibility. A wide open field . Trying to predict the next major champion is a futile exercise. Since the start of the 2009 season, there have been 18 different winners of the 20 major titles on offer -- and 15 of those were first-time victors. Such is the talent being stockpiled at the top of the game, the winner could come from pretty much any continent and be stationed at either end of the age spectrum. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy was 22 when he won the 2011 U.S. Open at Congressional -- the youngest winner since 1923, when the legendary American Bobby Jones triumphed. And Mickelson clocked in at 43 years young when he secured the fifth major of his career at the 2013 British Open at Muirfield in Scotland. Talented teenagers and voracious veterans lurk at every corner of a major championship field, and of the 97 players competing, around 70 will think they have a realistic chance of winning. McIlroy's redemption? Until McIlroy is cloaked in a green jacket, the abiding memory of his Masters experience will be of a red-faced youngster slumped over his club as one of golf's greatest chokes took hold. At the tender age of 21, he went into the final round at Augusta in 2011 with a four-shot lead, and blew it in epic style. The sight of McIlroy wandering around the VIP cabins 50 yards to the left of the 10th fairway looking for his errant tee shot are now the stuff of legend. By the time he signed for an eight-over final round of 80, to sink from first place to a tie for 15th, there wasn't a right-minded spectator who didn't feel the urge to give him a consoling hug. A typically stoic interview on the 18th further endeared the youngster to viewers the world over, as he admitted he couldn't put his finger on why he had ""unraveled"" in such a fashion. He later said he ""wasn't ready to win a major"" but just a few months later, he was. At the very next major, he shot a record low U.S Open score to win at Congressional in Maryland by an emphatic eight shots. The next year he doubled his major tally, adding the U.S. PGA Championship to his trophy cabinet, but you get the feeling he won't be content until his redemption at Augusta is complete. The Asian invasion . Adam Scott became the first Australian to win the Masters last year but how long will it be before the first Asian winner of golf's most prestigious prize? Last year's tournament was abuzz with the sight of China's Guan Tianlang striding the famous fairways at the tender age of 14, and winning the low amateur medal. The child prodigy represents a burgeoning talent pool in Asia, seeking to build on the breakthrough success made by Y.E. Yang at the 2009 U.S. PGA Championship. Not only did the Korean serve notice of Asia's arrival at the top table of golf, he did it by beating the greatest golfer of a generation -- Tiger Woods. The highest-ranked Asian player is Japan's Hideki Matsuyama, who sits 26th in the world list on only his second year on the PGA Tour. Matsuyama won the leading amateur prize on his Augusta debut as a 19-year-old in 2011 and already has a top-five finish on this season's PGA Tour. His compatriot Ryo Ishikawa has a top-10 place to his name this season despite languishing in the lower reaches of the top 100, while Korean veteran K.J. Choi has been a longstanding representative of Asia at the top level. Another one to watch is Thailand's 51st-ranked Thongchai Jaidee, who has five European Tour titles to his name. The Great Scott sequel? The last person to retain the Masters crown was -- yep, you guessed it -- Woods back in 2002 but could Scott be about to double Australia's tally of wins at Augusta? No-one is ranked higher than the 33-year-old going into the tournament. In fact, only a poor final round at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March prevented him from returning to Georgia as world No. 1. He spoke on Tuesday of the privileges afforded to a Masters champion -- playing the course with his father Phil and hanging out in the champions' locker room. And after an arduous few years trying to land his maiden major, with his slump a the British Open in 2012 a particularly bitter pill to swallow, Scott's game has been freed up after last year's win. ""It has been incredible to see the reception I get every week I play since being a Masters champion,"" he said in his press conference. ""It has been a real buzz for me to be welcomed at all the golf courses I'm at. ""This week has been something I have been really looking forward to. But as the last week came around, I also realized it would be time for me to bring the green jacket back and leave it here maybe. ""So that motivated me to work harder that last week at home and try and get myself into some kind of form that can maybe go back-to-back and keep the jacket for another year."" A European 2014? The last European to don the famous green jacket was Jose Maria Olazabal in 1999. It was the second time the Spaniard had triumphed at Augusta, having won the Masters in 1994. Arguably the third leg of a hat-trick of Olazabal's career highlights also came on American soil, when he masterminded what will forever be known as the ""Miracle of Medinah"" when serving as Europe's Ryder Cup captain. Trailing 10-6 going into the final day of singles matches in the Ryder Cup clash between Europe and the United States, Olazabal's men pulled off one of the greatest sporting comebacks of all time to eventually triumph 14Â½ points to 13Â½. The U.S. team, led this time by veteran Tom Watson, are plotting their revenge ahead of the next clash in Scotland in October, but what better way to lay down a marker than for a European to end the continent's 14-year drought at Augusta? There are four European players in the world's top 10 and two of them -- England's Justin Rose and McIlroy -- are already major champions. Sweden's Henrik Stenson won both the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup and the European Tour's Race to Dubai last year, while Sergio Garcia has finished in the top five in all four major championships during his career. Don't be surprised if Europe marches off with another major honor come Sunday. And finally .... The Tiger factor . He might not be playing but that doesn't mean Woods won't still be a talking point in Masters week. Whether it is clips of his famous chip-in back in 2005, or reams of column inches detailing his four Masters wins, Tiger's absence certainly doesn't mean he'll be absent from the debate. And of course, once the green jacket has been placed on the shoulders of the winner, a popular refrain might be ""What if Tiger had been playing?""","CNN World Sport takes a look at six potential storylines ahead of the 2014 Masters .

ffe0c7e88ea96c3d925dbabfcf01fba7475c65d6,"(CNN) -- It's every flier's worst nightmare: Your pilot announces, ""We're all going down!"" and starts shouting about bombs and terrorists. He abandons the cockpit, frantically running up and down the aisles like a man unhinged. What do you do? That's what passengers on a JetBlue flight had to decide Tuesday when their pilot, Capt. Clayton Osbon, seemed to have a meltdown in the air between New York and Las Vegas. Fortunately for everyone on board, a quick-thinking co-pilot and some alert passengers snapped into action. Initial reports suggest that at least four passengers leapt to their feet and subdued the pilot, who had been trying to break down the cockpit door after his co-pilot locked him out. The heroic passengers have been praised for their bravery, and rightly so: They may have saved 141 lives on the plane, and maybe more on the ground. It's hard to hear this story and not admire their swift and effective action -- and wonder how you'd respond in the same situation. Would you jump up and subdue a hysterical pilot or sit paralyzed in your seat? Hundreds of studies have explored the so-called ""bystander effect,"" trying to determine why some observers respond positively to a crisis while others ignore it. The research points to a somewhat surprising conclusion: Generally speaking, only subtle differences separate the bystanders from the heroes. Most of us, it seems, can fall into either category depending on the details of a situation. The JetBlue crisis highlights some of the factors that can make a difference, suggesting how we can get people -- ourselves included -- to take action in an emergency. It might seem obvious that when confronted with a raving man attacking a cockpit door, people would realize they should do something to stop him. But that's not always the case, especially when they're part of a large crowd. In fact, in one famous study, social psychologists John Darley and Bibb Latane left people alone in a room and pumped in smoke -- a pretty clear warning sign of danger, maybe on par with a 250-pound guy in a pilot's uniform shouting incoherently about Iran and Iraq. When people were alone in the room, they left and reported the smoke to someone else 75% of the time. But when there were three people in the room, they reported the smoke 38% of the time, illustrating the problem psychologists call ""pluralistic ignorance,"" where we mistake other people's inaction as a sign that everything's actually OK. After all, no one wants to be the fool who tackles your plane's pilot because you misread the situation -- maybe he was just playing a practical joke? When we don't see anyone else respond, we tend to assume there isn't really a crisis; as a result, we inadvertently hold each other back. But response rates shoot up dramatically when one bystander simply acknowledges to another that there might be a problem. So on the JetBlue flight, it helped tremendously that the co-pilot and a flight attendant had the presence of mind to use the public address system to call on the passengers to restrain the pilot. It becomes nearly impossible to assume there isn't really a problem when your acting captain says there is. Yet even once we recognize there's a problem, in crowds we often fall prey to what's called a ""diffusion of responsibility,"" where we assume the people around us are going to help, so there's less of a need for us to take action ourselves. Research by Darley and others shows that the greater the number of people who witness a crisis, the lower the odds that any of them will do anything. To overcome this, it helps when we're singled out personally. Darley once told me that if you ever sprain your ankle in public, don't just call for help -- pick out someone in the crowd and say, ""Hey, you there, can you give me a hand?"" On the JetBlue flight, it seems like the crew only made a blanket appeal to the passengers for help, which probably wasn't as effective as it could have been. Only four passengers out of nearly 150 sprang to action -- responsibility still might have been pretty diffused. But it likely helped that several of the plane's passengers were retired or off-duty law enforcement on their way to a security convention in Las Vegas. Darley's research has found that personality doesn't necessarily predict whether someone will help. What's more important is whether bystanders have the experience to recognize a crisis when it's unfolding and feel like they have the skills to do something about it. So it probably should come as no surprise that among those who sprang to action, one was a former prison guard and another was an ex-New York police sergeant with 22 years of experience on the force. That sergeant, Paul Babakitis, told CBS News that when he saw the pilot running amok, ""my training immediately kicked in."" He said he believed he was ""deranged"" when he looked into his eyes because he had ""dealt with a lot of emotionally disturbed people during my time on the force."" People who have experience in law enforcement or the military are probably better at recognizing a crisis because they're less likely to convince themselves that this couldn't be happening to them, could it? Of course, ""pluralistic ignorance"" might be harder for any of us to maintain on a plane after 9/11, even 10 years later. It's harder today to rule out the plausibility of any crisis. Indeed, Babakitis said he immediately thought of that day when he saw Osbon storming the cockpit. ""Not again,"" he told himself, ""not while I'm on this plane."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Marsh.","Jason Marsh calls quick action of JetBlue passengers with captain admirable .

ffe0d73f951f86ac46f1beaa07dbb3d51e25a382,"This time last year Regane MacColl was excitedly planning her future. After achieving good grades in her Higher exams, the popular ‘fun-loving’ schoolgirl had applied to university with dreams of becoming a lawyer. Her proud family had just welcomed her back from a charitable mission to help orphaned children in Africa – for which she raised thousands of pounds - and she had been invited to talk at an event alongside MSPs. But on a night out with friends at the Arches Nightclub in Glasgow in early February, the 17-year-old fell victim to Scotland’s deadly ‘party drug’ culture. Hard-working: Regane  MaColl was a fun-loving teen who adored her family . Her death from ecstasy sent shockwaves across the country – and her distraught family were left asking ‘why?’ Now, for the first time, her parents have spoken publicly about the tragedy and paid tribute to ‘a girl who brought a smile to everyone she met’. In an exclusive interview with the Scottish Mail on Sunday on the eve of the anniversary of Regane’s death, her father Alastair MacColl and mother Vicki Lenaghan revealed their horror at finding out she had been rushed to hospital, the anxious wait for news and the boundless grief when the teen lost her fight for life. They also issued an emotional warning about the trail of destruction left behind by drugs and urged fellow parents to ‘talk honestly to their kids’. ‘People always think it will never happen to them – but it can,’ Mr MacColl, 43, said. ‘There is nothing worse than losing a child and I hate to think of other families going through the pain we have experienced this past year. ‘I would ask parents to sit down with their kids and be honest with them about how dangerous trying drugs just once can be. Perfect daughter: Regane as a child with her mother Vicki. Her parents still do not know exactly what happened in the hours leading up to Regane’s death . ‘If anyone could see the devastation it can cause before they take something they would think twice.’ Miss Lenaghan, 42, said: ‘Our lives will never be the same. We will have to live with this pain for the rest of our days. ‘Time goes on but this cannot be healed.’ Her parents still do not know exactly what happened in the hours leading up to Regane’s death but toxicology reports showed she had the class A drug MDMA – found in ecstasy tablets – in her system. Doctors fought for hours in an attempt to save the 17-year-old - a sixth year pupil at St Peter the Apostle High School in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire - after she collapsed at the late night club venue but she died later that day with her parents at her bedside. In the weeks surrounding the tragedy, police put out repeated warnings to young people to beware of a particularly strong strain of ecstasy known as Mortal Kombat. The red coloured pills, which are stamped with a dragon logo, were linked to the hospitalisations of three other young people at that time. However her parents never considered that their studious and responsible eldest child might find herself in a position where she would try drugs. ‘It was just not like her’, Miss Lenaghan said. ‘She had never given us reason to worry by coming home really late or really drunk and was the responsible one in her group.’ Mr MacColl continued: ‘We never felt the need to explicitly warn her not to do it. We could talk about anything with her and, of course, drugs and their dangers came up but we never felt we had to sit her down and tell her ‘do not do that tonight’.’ Regane, pictured with her father Alastair. He said: ‘People always think it will never happen to them but it can' They learned she was in trouble after Miss Lenaghan received a worried phone call from her nephew who was inside the ambulance with Regane in the early hours of February 2 last year. ‘I was in bed when I got a call in the middle of the night from Regane’s cousin who was in the ambulance with her,’ Miss Lenaghan said. ‘He said she wasn’t well and was going to hospital and that I needed to come quickly. It is all a blur but I remember thinking that maybe she had suffered an asthma attack or had drunk too much alcohol. ‘I called her dad and we all headed to the hospital. At no point did we realise how serious it was. We all hoped she would be ok.’ Mr MacColl added: ‘We still do not know exactly what happened inside the Arches. We know she became separated from her friends and that at the end of the night she became very unwell. ‘We were told that Regane’s body had taken a reaction to a substance and learned that some other young people who had been in the club had been hospitalised after apparently taking Mortal Kombat ecstasy pills. ‘One thing we do know is that our daughter was not a regular drug user.’ Regane’s heartbroken mother is determined she be remembered ‘not for how she died, but who she was’. ‘She was a fun-loving and caring girl. She was smart and vivacious and was just starting to spread her wings in the world,’ Miss Lenaghan said. ‘When people think of her, we want them to recall how much potential she had and how much she achieved so much in a short space of time. Caring: Regane with children during her charity visit to Tanzania before her death . ‘She had just submitted her applications to university to study law. ‘She did some work experience with in our local court and absolutely loved it so applied to the law schools at Strathclyde University and Stirling University. ‘She did well in her Higher exams in 5th year, particularly in English which she had a real natural ability for, and was studying Advanced Highers in English, politics and sociology. She had such a promising future ahead of her.’ One of Regane’s most impressive achievements was being selected from dozens of other young people to go to Africa with The Twende Pamoja Trust — a charity which aims to build relationships between communities in Tanzania and the UK. There she visited schools and orphanages to teach them about Scottish culture and saw first-hand how the money raised for the cause was helping disadvantaged children. Mr MacColl said: ‘She spent three weeks in Tanzania with the most basic of facilities, visiting schools and an orphanage. ‘We were worried she would struggle with it all, as she was a girl who liked to look good and was used to comfortable surroundings, but she surprised everyone. She took to it like a duck to water. ‘She had grown up so much when she returned. She was less bothered about material things and how she looked and was so much more confident. ‘She worked so hard to raise money for the charity, which has links with her school, and had been offered the chance to return this year.’ Miss Lenaghan said: ‘That was the first time she had been away from her family for such a long time and we struggled not being able to contact her for the first ten days. We worried about her, as all parents do. Police put out repeated warnings to young people of Mortal Kombat ecstasy pills, which were linked to the hospitalisations of three other young people at that time . ‘Now, ten days without her does not seem long at all.’ She added: ‘Family was always incredibly important to Regane. She put her family first and was a great big sister. It hurts so much that her siblings won’t have her as an influence any more. ‘So many people have been left devastated by her death, her parents, step parents, brothers, sister, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, friends, colleagues, teachers.’ The support of family, friends and their local community in Clydebank, Dunbartonshire have helped over the past 12 months but Regane’s parents’ pain still remains ‘very raw’. Miss Lenaghan said: ‘We are still in total disbelief. ‘It doesn’t feel real. If my phones rings I still think it might be her. I still hope she will walk into the kitchen with that beautiful smile and tell me a funny story about her day. Mr MacColl said: ‘I could look at her photographs for hours and it feels like she is there with me.’ Despite separating when Regane was very young, her parents remain close and have supported each other through the most difficult stages of grief. As well as her parents, Regane also had a particularly strong bond with her younger brothers Ben, Leo and Aaron, little sister Sophie and her step-parents. Her step-mother Clare MacColl said: ‘Her brothers and sisters still talk about her all the time. It is hard to hear because we are still hurting but also lovely because they are keeping her memory alive. They keep us going and tell us that Regane would not want us to be sad. ‘Regane shared a room with her little sister Sophie, who is 10, and recently she has been struggling because she doesn’t have her to talk to. ‘She’s growing up and there are things that she wouldn’t want to tell her parents but that Regane would have helped her with. She recently wrote a letter to Regane in her diary and it was heart-breaking.’ December 8 last year would have been Regane’s 18th birthday and keen to mark the date ‘how she would have wanted’ her family got together to celebrate her life. Miss Lenaghan said: ‘She was looking forward to turning 18 so much. It is such a milestone for teenagers. ‘It was hard but we wanted to mark it and celebrate for her. We all got together and went to her graveside. It was covered with flowers and birthday cards from her friends, which really touched us. Her brothers and sister let off doves and we all shared stories. ‘All her school friends have been celebrating their 18th and going off to university. ‘It is very bittersweet for us because we are so happy for them – we watched them grow up alongside Regane – but it hurts so much that our daughter cannot join them.’","After achieving good grades, popular schoolgirl had applied to university .

ffe17257aa2c468ea3387ce6665bf0f4d160607b,"(CNN) -- President-elect Barack Obama's transition team announced several key appointments to his communications team Saturday. Robert Gibbs will have one of the most highly visible roles in the Obama administration. Robert Gibbs, an Obama campaign spokesman who also has acted as spokesman for the transition, will become Obama's press secretary, one of the most highly visible roles in the administration. Gibbs, an Auburn, Alabama, native who has worked for Sen. Fritz Hollings, the Democratic Senatorial Committee and Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign, was communications director and then a senior strategist for the Obama campaign. Ellen Moran, executive director of EMILY's List, will serve as Obama's communications director. Moran worked for the AFL-CIO, coordinating ""Wal-Mart corporate accountability activities,"" before returning to EMILY's, an organization dedicated to helping Democratic women get elected to office. It had endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton for president.  See who's on Obama's short list for cabinet posts » . Dan Pfeiffer, current communications director with the transition team, will be Obama's deputy communications director. He began work with the Obama campaign in January 2007 as traveling press secretary before returning to Chicago, Illinois, to work as communications director. Unlike Gibbs and Pfeiffer, Moran is not already on Obama's communications team. ""These individuals will fill essential roles, and bring a breadth and depth of experience that can help our administration advance prosperity and security for the American people,"" Obama said in a written statement. ""This dedicated and impressive group of public servants includes longtime advisors and a talented new addition to our team, and together we will work to serve our country and meet the challenges of this defining moment in history."" On Friday, sources indicated that some of Obama's Cabinet posts were close to being filled. Two sources close to the transition team said New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner is ""on track"" to be offered the Treasury secretary post.  Watch CNN's Anderson Cooper discuss Obama's choices » . Transition officials told The Associated Press on Saturday that Obama planned to announce Geithner's appointment on Monday, along with that of Lawrence Summers as director of the National Economic Council. Summers is a former president of Harvard University and served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton. Two sources said Friday that Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is a serious contender for commerce secretary but that he could be chosen for another senior post. Geithner has played a large role in the government's efforts to wrangle the credit crisis, which has damaged markets and economies worldwide. Although a number of those efforts have been controversial, Geithner remains a well-regarded figure from Wall Street to Washington. Geithner began working with the Treasury Department in 1988 in the International Affairs division. In 1999, he became under-secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. Geithner would be charged with restoring stability to the financial markets, the banking system and the housing sector through oversight of the controversial $700 billion financial rescue package, of which about half is still available for use at the discretion of the Treasury secretary.  Watch CNN's John King discuss the posts with panelists » . The Dow Jones industrial index staged a late rally Friday after traders heard news of Geithner's possible appointment, rising by almost 500 points shortly before the market's closing time. The two sources close to the transition team said they do not consider Richardson's appointment to the Commerce Department to be a done deal. Richardson, 61, was a candidate for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Currently in his second term as New Mexico's governor, he served as ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary in the Clinton administration. Richardson is also considered to be a possibility for the secretary of state post. Also Friday, Sen. Hillary Clinton's camp shot down reports that she had agreed to accept the secretary of state position. ""We're still in discussions, which are very much on track,"" said Philippe Reines, Clinton's senior adviser. ""Any reports beyond that are premature."" The New York Times reported that Clinton would give up her Senate seat and accept the Cabinet post, citing two confidants, who said the decision was made after further consultation with Obama about the nature of her role and his foreign policy plans. A senior Obama aide told CNN there has been no development on a possible Clinton appointment since they informed CNN Thursday that she is ""on track"" to be nominated for secretary of state. Obama's transition team also appears close to choosing a national security adviser to the White House. Retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones has emerged as the president-elect's leading choice for the position, two sources close to the Obama transition team say. The sources said Jones has been given the impression by Obama that the job is his if he wants it. But the officials said that private discussions are under way and that no final decision has been made. The discussions are focused on precisely how much power Jones will have in the staff job, since he is used to being in a command role. Among his many posts, Jones served for several years as the operational commander for NATO.","NEW: Timothy Geithner to be announced as Treasury pick, AP reports .

But Melissa Richardson, whose son Isaac collapsed after drinking at the hostel where he worked in Woolwich, south east London, said she did not blame his friend who nominated him. The inquest heard that Mr Richardson consumed an estimated 30 units of alcohol when he drank a 1.5-litre cocktail containing rose wine, vodka, beer and whiskey from a pitcher 'in one go' in two minutes after asking a friend to film him on a smartphone. Barman Isaac Richardson, pictured, died after taking part in the NekNominate online drinking craze at the hostel where he worked in Woolwich, south east London, an inquest heard . The 20-year-old collapsed and fell unconscious minutes later and died at hospital in the early hours of February 9 despite the efforts of paramedics and people at the hostel to resuscitate him. Pathology tests found he had drunk a 'very high' amount of alcohol which was 'within the range to induce a coma', the court heard. Mrs Richardson told Southwark Coroner's Court: 'We feel very strongly that it is no one's fault. 'He would not have wanted anyone to be singled out or blamed for something that was his decision. 'I don't blame his friend who nominated him or the friends who were with him that evening. It is a comfort to know that he was not alone.' But she added: 'If it were not for this craze and his nomination, my son would still be alive.' The NekNominate game involves participants filming themselves downing alcohol, nominating someone to continue the game, and posting the video on Facebook. It became an online craze earlier this year after originating in Australia and has seen players consuming alcohol with dog food, engine oil and live goldfish. Mrs Richardson said in a statement referred to in court that the NekNominate craze had reached its peak at a time when her son had 'too much idle time and too little focus in his life'. Melissa Richardson (right), the mother of Isaac Richardson (left) told his inquest that he would still be alive if it were not for the Neknominate game . Her son died of acute alcohol intoxication and coroner Dr Andrew Harris recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: 'Mr Richardson chose to accept a NekNominate challenge and drank about one and a half litres in about two minutes, shortly afterwards collapsing unconscious.' The court heard Mr Richardson, 20, was one of three people nominated on Facebook by his friend Ross Burton. In a statement read by the coroner, Mr Burton said: 'I confirm that at no point did I tell anyone what to drink. The first time I found out about the drinks Isaac had drunk was through the papers.' Detective Sergeant Roy Black said police determined that the death was not suspicious and no crime had been committed. He said the nomination was made without any 'pressure or force' and the coroner said in his verdict that there was 'no question of any unlawful action'. An inquest heard how Stephen Brookes died after taking part in the NekNominate . The NekNominate game involves participants filming themselves downing alcohol, nominating someone to continue the game, and posting the video on Facebook. It became an online craze  after originating in Australia and has seen players consuming alcohol with dog food, engine oil and live goldfish. Earlier this year an inquest heard how rugby fan Stephen Brookes died after downing almost a bottle of vodka during a challenge. The 29-year-old was six times over the drink-drive limit when he collapsed after drinking more than a pint of the spirit 'in seconds' while being filmed by a friend. His distraught family said today he would still be alive today but for the NekNominate craze. In February two young men died in Ireland, both suspected victims of the drinking craze. Ross Cummins, 22, was found unconscious in a house in Dublin in the early hours of the morning and died later in hospital amid reports he was drinking spirits at the time of his death. Hours later, the body of Jonny Byrne, 19, was discovered floating in the river at Milford Bridge in County Carlow after apparently jumping in as part of a nomination. Mr Byrne's family later pleaded with people not to take part in the drinking game. Mr Richardson had been drinking at O'Conners pub below the hostel before heading upstairs to complete his challenge. Robert Howard, a friend of Mr Richardson who was with him on the night he died, said: 'I saw him in the evening at about 9 o'clock, he had been drinking - I suppose he drank quite a lot but I don't and even when I want to get drunk I don't need to drink that much, so I can't gauge how much it takes for other people.' He added: 'He said he was going to do a NekNominate because he had been nominated but he didn't tell me exactly what he was going to do.' He described Mr Richardson mixing wine, beers and spirits into a pitcher and thinking that he was going to pour it into a glass. But he watched him down the whole thing in less than two minutes. Mr Howard said he helped get Mr Richardson to the toilet so he could throw up, but realised something was really wrong when he stumbled away from the toilet and collapsed on the floor. He gave his friend CPR while waiting for the ambulance to arrive but was unable to revive him. Mr Richardson (pictured left) had been drinking at O'Conners pub (pictured right) below the hostel before heading upstairs to complete his challenge . Dr Harris praised Mrs Richardson's 'courage and objectivity' in saying that she did not blame anyone for her son's death. After delivering the verdict, he asked whether she had any suggestions about any further action on the potential risks of the NekNominate phenomenon. She said: 'It was my son's decision to do what he did. He would not want me to use him as an example.' Earlier, the court heard Mr Richardson was a former grammar school pupil of 'great intellect'. He left school with 'numerous As and Bs' but began to attend parties regularly and his mother said he was drinking heavily in the months before his death. She said: 'He worked really hard and played really hard. He would get silly drunk.' Fighting back tears, she told the court: 'I did get fed up with him but we never fell out. It just wasn't in him to hold a grudge. ' She said Mr Richardson was 'susceptible to a dare' but he was 'never one swayed by others' and he could resist peer pressure.","Isaac Richardson died after taking part in online NekNominate drinking craze .

ffe2aea6f8d8a62a99bd2c60e225dce9f651e157,"Baghdad (CNN) -- A barrage of attacks struck Monday across Iraq, killing at least 84 people and wounding more than 200, said officials, who likened the attacks to another outbreak last year. ""Once again, murderers and criminals have carried out attacks against innocent civilians to add a new page to their black criminal record,"" Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said in a written statement. He called on security forces to ""not let the killers catch their breath,"" and to pursue them ""until they finish them."" Some of the 21 reported bombings and shootings targeted police and security forces, while others targeted civilians. It was the worst wave of violence to strike the country in months, taking place on the halfway mark of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. ""Today's attacks are eerily similar to the stream of large-scale, complex attacks that occurred here last year during Ramadan on August 25,"" said Maj. Angela Funaro, spokeswoman for United States Forces-Iraq. Officials believe last year's attacks were carried out by al Qaeda in Iraq ""to shake the public's confidence in the capabilities of the ISF (Iraqi Security Forces) to defend this country,"" but it is too early to speculate about who may have been behind Monday's attacks, Funaro said in an e-mail. A posting Monday on a jihadist website praised the attacks against ""Shiites, Christians, and the apostate Awakening Councils."" The post did not include a claim of responsibility. Awakening Councils are made up of former Sunni militants now in the pay of the Iraqi government, which have been credited with helping reduce violence. They are also frequent targets of assassination attempts. The attacks come weeks after Iraq's political leaders agreed to request U.S. troops stay beyond a January 1, 2012, deadline to withdraw. While the United States pulled its combat troops last year, between 46,000 and 50,000 troops have remained to provide support and training. The United States is widely expected to agree to some kind of limited extension of training personnel and equipment. Last week, Muqtada al-Sadr, the influential Iraqi Shiite cleric staunchly opposed to U.S. troop presence, warned against the prospects of a ""challenge"" with any U.S. forces that may stay in Iraq. His Mehdi army militia was a major factor in the sectarian violence that erupted during the height of the war. Al-Maliki said Monday's attacks ""cannot undermine the resolve of our citizens and our armed forces."" Monday's violence ended a period of calm that began about the same time as Ramadan. Ministry of Interior officials called on security forces to ban people from parking their vehicles on the streets of cities targeted in the attacks, saying they feared more violence. In Tikrit, north of Baghdad, officials imposed a curfew on vehicles until further notice after a fatal suicide attack, officials with the Interior Ministry said. Funaro said Iraq forces requested U.S. assistance only in Tikrit, and added that U.S. forces ""are prepared to assist in any capacity"" in line with the security agreement in place. Two suicide bombers targeted security forces in Tikrit -- Saddam Hussein's hometown -- killing at least four policemen and wounding 11, the two officials said. The deadliest of Monday's attacks was a double bombing that targeted civilians on a busy street in central Iraq, authorities said. At least 37 people were killed when a car bomb followed by a roadside bomb exploded on the commercial street in Kut during morning rush hour, according to health officials and police, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to release the information to the media. Sixty-five people were wounded in the attack, Dr. Dhiya al-Deen Jalil, the head of the health directorate in Kut, told CNN. In Twareej, near the southern holy city of Karbala, a car bomb exploded near a police station, killing at least eight people and wounding 20, two officials at the Interior Ministry told CNN. The officials also spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason as the police. A string of explosions rocked Baghdad, killing at least three people and wounding 34, the officials said. Among the attacks were two car bombings that targeted an Iraqi army patrol and an Education Ministry convoy, the officials said. In Yusufiya, about 35 kilometers south of Baghdad, gunmen wearing Iraqi army uniforms entered a Sunni mosque around 9:30 p.m. and summoned seven worshipers by name to step outside the mosque and form a line, said an Interior Ministry official who was not authorized to speak to the news media. The gunmen then fatally shot the seven, who were members of a local Awakening Council. A bomb in a parked car in Najaf killed 11 people and wounded 50. Another parked car bomb in Kirkuk killed one person and wounded eight. A motorcycle rigged with explosives detained at an Iraqi police patrol in central Kirkuk wounded seven people. In Baquba, a suicide car bomb, another car bomb, and a shooting attack killed 13 people. Four roadside bombs exploded in Mosul, wounding five people. In the Sunni-dominated Anbar province, a man building a bomb in his house in Falluja inadvertently detonated it, killing his own 5-year-old son and wounding his wife and three other children, police and health officials in Falluja said.  The man was later arrested. While violence in Iraq has fallen off in recent years, there has been an increase in attacks targeting civilians and U.S. and Iraqi security forces in recent months. Stuart Bowen, the U.S. official in charge of overseeing reconstruction in Iraq, said the country was more dangerous last month than it was the year before, according to an agency report to Congress in July. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","84 are killed and more than 200 wounded, according to reports from across Iraq .

ffe2bfc24c20623a58bba5bdc85ad3c7b31797e6,"(CNN) -- In the final weeks of his brief life, little Myls Dobson suffered unspeakable acts of neglect and violence. A New York criminal complaint released Friday at the arraignment of Kryzie King, 27, with whom the 4-year-old had been staying since mid-December, said the boy had burn marks and abrasions on his head, neck, face and testicles. There were bruises and numerous marks made by an object on his abdomen and legs and wrists -- bruises consistent with being restrained -- lacerations to his fingers, abrasions to his armpit, and bruises and scars on his back. The child appeared malnourished, the complaint said. Myls suffered ""horrific injuries sustained over a period of days,"" New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters. King pleaded not guilty at her arraignment in Manhattan criminal court on charges of first-degree assault, first-degree reckless endangerment, endangering the welfare of a child and unlawful imprisonment. But Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg told the court Friday that King also was being investigated on suspicion of murder, and likely faced additional charges upon the completion of the autopsy. In a statement, King's attorney, Bryan Konoski, said: ""My client is not charged with homicide at this time and she is presumed to be innocent of allegations against her. I would tell everyone not jump to any conclusions at this time."" Shortly before 11 a.m. on Wednesday, police responding to a 911 call found Myles locked in a bathroom at King's apartment at The Ritz Plaza, a luxury highrise in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan. He appeared battered, was unconscious and unresponsive on the floor, authorities said. The child was pronounced dead at St. Luke's Hospital at 1:52 p.m. King told police that Myls' father dropped the child off for her to watch on December 17 and that she was the ""child's primary and sole caretaker"" until the time of his death, the complaint said. The father was arrested in December for alleged bank fraud, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. At a news conference Friday, an adviser to the boy's mother, Ashlee Dobson, said that she lost custody of her son for financial reasons. The mother and the adviser, Tony Herbert, demanded answers from child welfare authorities. ""The city of New York put the child in the care of the father, who they knew was a felon,"" Herbert said. ""You open up a case and then you close it thinking everything is fine? No. That has to be answered. Who did that, who authorized that?"" A call placed to the city Administration for Children's Services was not returned. Dobson lost custody in 2012, according to CNN affiliate WCBS. ""She was in a shelter, they didn't think it best that she would be in that shelter with a baby, so they gave him to the father,"" Herbert said of child welfare authorities. Dobson told reporters Friday that she was turning her life around in hopes of regaining custody of her son. She had weekly visitation rights but last saw her son in November. In tears, Ashlee Dobson said, ""I love my son. He always loved me. He always gave me kisses."" The complaint portrays the finals weeks of Myls' life as a living hell. King told police that on December 29 she removed a hot rack from an oven with a glove and allegedly placed it against the boy's right leg, leaving linear burn marks, the complaint said. The next day, she told police, she allegedly struck him about his body five to six times with a belt, leaving bruises and scars. The complaint said King admitted that from December 30 to January 4 she allegedly tied the boy's wrists and feet together with shoe laces and gagged him with a piece of cloth. She told police that resulted in scaring on his wrists and ankles. On the day she freed him, the complaint said, King allegedly beat him twelve to thirteen times with a belt. On Tuesday, during subfreezing temperatures, King told police she allegedly locked the the child, wearing only a T-shirt and shorts, outside on a balcony from 20 minutes to an hour, the complaint said. That same day, she allegedly locked the boy inside a dark bathroom for about three hours. King told authorities that the boy was ""being very difficult eating and that the last full meal he ate was on December 26, 2013; after that he would only pick at his food,"" the complaint said. The last time the boy ate or drank anything was on January 3. Aside from her comments about the child not eating well, King gave no indication in the complaint of what might have prompted her purported actions. Since arriving at King's home on December 17, the complaint said, Myls Dobson lost 20 to 25 pounds. Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office, said an autopsy was performed Thursday but the cause of death is pending further study.

ffe2d96c672f399d938a905237ca512b5543a5a9,"(CNN) -- In what activists call a victory for Latinos, the U.S. government has resolved allegations relating to a series of warrantless home raids by immigration agents and must now follow new guidelines for conducing similar operations in the future. The terms were part of a federal court settlement approved on Thursday in New York between Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and nearly two dozen plaintiffs who joined in a class-action suit. The suit that was closely watched by immigrant communities who alleged ICE agents forced their way into eight homes of Latino families on New York's Long Island in 2006 and 2007 without legal justification. ""This is a positive step in the ability to hold ICE officers accountable for misconduct,"" said Axel Caballero, founder of My Cuentame, a nonprofit immigrant-rights filmmaker. ""We hope officers and the agency are wise enough to not ignore the decision. But this is not enough. This is just the beginning of change that needs to be done."" The lead plaintiff, Adriana Aguilar, said agents pounded on doors in the middle of the night and came into her East Hampton home even though they were denied entry. She shared the home with her parents, siblings and children, who are all U.S. citizens. ""ICE is known for tactics like showing up unexpectedly and banging on doors, a common strategy that has been employed fairly routinely,"" said Camille Mackler, director of training and technical assistance at the New York Immigration Coalition. ""But now with this change in federal policy, hopefully people's basic constitutional rights won't be violated."" Under revised guidelines for cases without warrants, ICE must establish a policy requiring that agents, when feasible, obtain permission to enter a home in a language residents can understand. There are also new restrictions for when searches can be conducted on property surrounding a home. The government, as part of the settlement, also agreed to pay $1 million and drop or put aside immigration proceedings in several cases related to the raids. ""Undocumented immigrants have less rights than U.S. citizens would but they do have basic constitutional protection that gives them the right to be protected from unreasonable search and seizure,"" explained Mackler. ICE declined to comment on the settlement. CNN's Jaqueline Hurtado contributed to this report.","Class-action suit revolved around raids of homes in New York .

ffe33945bf4ccdfc1d6cca7bb4d62123907daaa4,"A veteran who collapsed in an Albuquerque Veteran Affairs hospital cafeteria, 500 yards from the emergency room, died after waiting 30 minutes for an ambulance, officials confirmed on Thursday. Officials at the hospital said it took a half an hour for the ambulance to be dispatched and take the man from one building to the other, which is about a five minute walk. VA spokeswoman Sonja Brown said Kirtland Air Force Medical Group personnel performed CPR until the ambulance arrived. A veteran who needed an ambulance after collapsing in the cafeteria of the Albuquerque Veterans Affairs Hospital died after waiting 30 minutes for an ambulance . She says staff followed policy in calling 911 when the man collapsed on Monday. 'Our policy is under expedited review,' Brown said. The man's name hasn't been released. The death comes at the Department of Veterans Affairs remains under scrutiny for widespread reports of long delays for treatment and medical appointments and of veterans dying while on waiting lists. A review last week cited 'significant and chronic system failures' in the nation's health system for veterans. The review also portrayed the struggling agency as one battling a corrosive culture of distrust, lacking in resources and ill-prepared to deal with an influx of new and older veterans with a range of medical and mental health care needs. The scathing report by deputy White House chief of staff Rob Nabors said the Veterans Health Administration, the VA sub agency that provides health care to about 8.8 million veterans a year, has systematically ignored warnings about its deficiencies and must be fundamentally restructured. Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson speaks during a news conference at the VA Medical Center in Washington on Wednesday to release the results from its Nationwide Access Audit . Not only are Veterans forced to wait for ambulances, tens of thousands more veterans than previously reported are forced to wait at least a month for medical appointments at Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics, according to an updated audit of 731 VA medical facilities released in June. The updated report includes new figures showing that the wait times actually experienced at most VA facilities were shorter than those on waiting lists for pending appointments. For instance, new patients at the Atlanta VA hospital waited about an average of 44 days for an appointment in April, the new report said. But the average wait for pending appointments at Atlanta was 66 days. Similar disparities in average wait times were found around the country. Pending appointments, for example, don't include patients who walk into a clinic and get immediate or quick treatment, VA officials said. They also don't reflect rescheduled appointments or those that are moved up because of openings due to cancellations. VA officials said the two sets of data complement one another, but both are evidence that many veterans face long waits for care. More than 56,000 veterans were waiting more than 90 days for an initial appointment, the new report said. 'In many communities across the country, veterans wait too long for the high quality care they've earned and deserve,' acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said back in June. The department has reached out to 70,000 veterans to get them off waiting lists and into clinics, Gibson said, 'but there is still much more work to be done.' The report released Thursday showed that about 10 percent of veterans seeking medical care at VA hospitals and clinics have to wait at least 30 days for an appointment. That's more than double the 4 percent of veterans the government said last week were forced to endure long waits. Gibson called the increase unfortunate, but said it was probably an indication that more reliable data was being reported by VA schedulers, rather than a big increase in veteran wait times. Administrators at local VA medical centers questioned the results of an audit released June 9, which looked only at pending appointments. The report did not match internal data on completed appointments showing waits actually were far shorter, the local officials said. The reliability of both sets of data is in question. The VA is investigating widespread manipulation of appointment data by schedulers following an uproar over since-confirmed allegations that dozens of veterans died while awaiting appointments at the Phoenix VA medical center. This 2007 file photo shows Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital, a Veteran's facility in Washington . Some 13 percent of schedulers surveyed by the auditors reported being told by supervisors to falsify appointment records to make patient waits appear shorter. The VA's inspector general has cited a since-abandoned performance bonus system as a reason for the falsifications, which schedulers used to mask frequent, long delays in treatment for veterans. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned three weeks ago amid an election-year firestorm over the treatment delays and waiting list problems at VA facilities nationwide.Shinseki took the blame for what he decried as a 'lack of integrity' through the VA network, which serves nearly 9 million veterans. The House and Senate have approved separate bills to allow more veterans who can't get timely VA appointments to see local doctors listed instead. The proposals also would make it easier to fire senior VA regional officials and hospital administrators. The June 9 audit found that more than 57,000 veterans were waiting at least 90 days for their first VA medical appointments, and an additional 64,000 appeared to have fallen through the cracks, never getting appointments after enrolling for VA care within the past 10 years. The new report said the number of veterans waiting more than 90 days dropped to about 56,300. About 46,400 veterans still have never gotten an appointment despite seeking one over the past decade, the report said. Gibson, who replaced Shinseki May 30, said he still is not 100 percent confident that all wait times listed on VA computers — and its audits — are accurate. 'I have vastly greater confidence in the quality' of wait-time data being reported by VA employees, he said during a speech this week in Washington. 'But I can't look at the entire database and say it's correct either.'","Officials at Albuquerque Veterans Affairs Hospital said it took a .

ffe3c1723a9432655e20df79a3cd412cbff40abb,"(CNN) -- Rightly billed as a clash of tennis titans, World No.1 versus World No.2, few were expecting the comprehensive manner of Novak Djokovic's defeat of Rafael Nadal to retain the ATP World Tour Finals title Monday night in London. Nadal will still end the year as the top ranked player in the world, but he was given a timely reminder that on the fast indoor surface of the 02 Arena, Djokovic reigns supreme, retaining his title with a 6-3 6-4 victory. It came after just one hour 36 minutes on his third championship point, with Nadal putting a forehand wide, rounding off an uncharacteristically tame display from the Spaniard. Djokovic has been undefeated since losing to Nadal in the final of the U.S. Open in September and he deservedly lifted the trophy, named in honor of former ATP president Brad Drewett, who died earlier this year. After the gladiatorial style entrants by both men, it was Djokovic who struck the first blows, racing to a 3-0 lead with an early break of Nadal's service. He had a point for a double break, but the Spaniard weathered the storm before making inroads on Djokovic's next service game to draw them level at 3-3. But Djokovic was not to be denied and after holding his own service, he broke Nadal again, the decisive point seeing both men at full stretch with scarcely believable retrieving. Djokovic finally put away a decisive volley then held his own service, clinching the set with an ace. He was immediately on the front foot in the second set, breaking Nadal early again to take a lead he never relinquished. Nadal was under pressure as he served to stay in the match at 3-5, saving the first match point and forcing his opponent to serve out for the championship. Nadal at last showed glimpses of his true quality by saving a second championship point, but any hopes of an unlikely revival were quickly snuffed out as Djokovic sent down an ace to bring up his third chance to take the title for a third time. Nadal still leads their career meetings 22-17 and will be looking to revenge the defeat when the 2014 season starts with the Australian Open in January. Before that, Djokovic will lead Serbia in the final of the Davis Cup against the Czech Republic, hoping to continue his unbeaten end to the season. Earlier, Fernando Verdasco and his Spanish compatriot David Marrero lifted the doubles title, beating the top seeds and three-time former champions Mike and Bob Bryan of the United States. Verdasco and Marrero won a close final 7-5 6-7 10-7 in one hour and 44 minutes, succeeding Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez as winners of the end of season finale. They shared $335,500 in prize money, while the Bryans -- five-time finalists -- split $195,500. The losing pair have the consolation of comfortably ending 2013 as the top pair in the world, winning three of the four major titles with a 70-13 record.","Novak Djokovic wins ATP World Tour Finals title for second straight year .

I almost didn't do it, but I kind of just went with it.' And lucky he did. Not only has the interview gone viral, Kaunisto said his little game actually helped him on the ice. 'To be honest, I wasn't playing that well right before the interview happened,' Kaunisto said. 'I think that really helped me out and kept me composed. Any other time I probably would've started laughing.' In the video the interview appears oblivious what Kaunisto is doing. Infamous: This silly scene from Super Troopers created 'The Cat Game', after two officers wage a bet whether one can say 'meow' 10 times during a traffic stop . 'Right meow we came out, hit a few guys quickly there,' he said. 'We got to get into the corners meow, and maybe pass the puck a couple more times down in the neutral zone there meow. 'Right meow our focus is on banking as many points meow, but right meow, we're doing a pretty good job coming out and getting the first goal. 'Thanks meow.'","Ray Kaunisto of the Kalamazoo Wings gave an on-ice interview during match against the Fort Wayne Komets on November 28 .

But when all was said and done, our boys had slumped to another defeat ... and the nation needed a scapegoat. Yet for once the national team had given fans a performance to be proud of – and so it was the BBC’s hapless pundit Phil Neville who bore the brunt of their frustrations. Former England player Phil Neville has been criticised for his co-commentary by fans and celebrities on Twitter . South Warwickshire police joined others on Twitter mocking BBC co-commentator Phil Neville . The force tweeted jokes about him as part of its safety campaign during the late-night match . Saturday was Neville’s first appearance as the Corporation’s new star pundit, and could prove to be his last after a brisk Twitter backlash. While England’s players ran Italy close on the pitch, Neville appeared to be out of his depth in the commentary box. Fans made fun of his robotic voice and dull insights, with some asking if he could be hauled off at half-time. He will be absent from England’s next two group games, which will be broadcast on ITV. However, the BBC has refused to say whether Neville would return if the team makes the knock-out rounds. The former England player, providing co-commentary alongside BBC regular Guy Mowbray, was compared by one viewer to the computer HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey. Another suggested he would be better off presenting the Shipping Forecast. Former Liverpool and Germany star Didi Hamann was among the stars criticising Neville's commentary . Despite also working for the BBC, comedian Danny Baker joined the backlash against the former player . Jokes about Neville lightened the evening for England fans, as the team slipped to a 2-1 defeat . Broadcaster Mary Ann Sieghart branded the former Everton midfielder's voice 'talking Temazepam' He was even mocked by the police, with . the South Warwickshire force’s official Twitter feed providing a string . of safety advice based on his disastrous performance. ‘At . least we know Phil Neville won’t stir the crowds in the pubs into a . frenzy. Drink sensibly,’ read one message, while another claimed . officers ‘will be playing recordings of Phil Neville all night to keep . the streets all calm and sleepy’. Some . fans asked whether it was possible to fire a commentator at half-time, . while former Liverpool midfielder Didier Hamann wrote: ‘If Phil Neville . reads his Twitter feed he may not come out for the second half.’ More than 13million viewers stayed up until the final whistle, just before 1am yesterday morning. The . Corporation could not yet say how many viewers complained about . Neville’s commentary, as weekend figures only become available on . Mondays. Some fans linked physio Gary Lewin's injury to Neville's dull performance in the commentary box . Tottenham MP David Lammy joked that, with such a dull voice, Neville may have a future in politics . Neville was signed up by the BBC after retiring from Everton last year and regularly appears on Match of the Day . Part of the team: Neville is part of the BBC team of pundits and co-commentators for the World Cup . It stressed that Neville had received training before being allowed on-air but, when asked whether he would return for the BBC’s next live England game, a spokesman said: ‘Everything for the final 16 will be decided much closer to the time.’ Critics suggested Neville’s appointment showed the folly of the BBC favouring ‘big names’ over seasoned professionals for its punditry team. Luckily, Neville – the brother of England assistant coach Gary – seems to have taken the comments in good spirits. He tweeted last night: ‘Sometimes you have to take the criticism – it will only make me better. Thanks for the feedback (ahhahaha)!’ The BBC gave England’s fans false hope after just a few minutes, when its on-screen graphic incorrectly put England 1-0 up. The blunder came after Raheem Sterling thumped a shot at goal from 30 yards that appeared to fly into the top corner. ‘Goal’ flashed up on the BBC’s coverage, and the score in the corner of the screen was changed to ‘ENG 1-0 ITA’ – but viewers were bemused to see Sterling fail to celebrate after such an excellent strike. In truth, Sterling’s shot was off-target, with the net only bulging because the ball had hit the side netting. The BBC swiftly rectified their error.","Commentator's performance panned as fans brand him 'dull' and 'robotic'

ffe4f2ed1ec64891addac466e716e6c0278b8898,"It will become a familiar sight as the season wears on. Every time Manchester United are awarded a free-kick in the general vicinity of the penalty box, a debate will ensue. Angel di Maria will fancy his chances and Robin van Persie will think it's well within his range. Juan Mata will remind everyone that he has a good track record and Wayne Rooney will try to pull rank as captain. Radamel Falcao may well join the conversation too and others will throw in their thoughts. If competition for places in United's starting line-up is intense for the Louis van Gaal-acticos, then the struggle to become regular free-kick taker is going to be really interesting. Louis van Gaal has plenty of players capable of striking a set-piece at Manchester United . Angel di Maria got his Manchester United career off to a flying start by scoring direct from a free-kick in the 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers last Sunday - though he may not have meant it . Juan Mata is also a fine striker of a set-piece and is a candidate to take them regularly for United . Each of those five players is capable of taking a good free-kick but, of course, only one can win the argument each time. New £60m signing Angel di Maria staked an early claim when he swung in United's opening goal from a wide free-kick against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday. He succeeded in delivering the ball into the 'corridor of uncertainty', deceived goalkeeper Rob Green when everyone else missed it and found the far corner of the net. Whether he meant it barely matters. Trouble is, Di Maria's qualities with the dead ball are unproven. He may well be an expert but with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in the Real Madrid side he didn't get much of a look in. As captain, Wayne Rooney may be able to pull rank when it comes to taking free-kicks . Robin van Persie is also capable of scoring direct from a free-kick . New loan signing Radamel Falcao can also strike the dead ball well . Goals and assists from free-kicks since the start of the 2011-2012 season: . Wayne Rooney – 5 goals (1 assist) Juan Mata – 4 (3) Robin van Persie – 2 (3) Angel di Maria – 1 (2) Radamel Falcao – 1 (0) Source: Opta . And while he can evidently deliver a killer ball from the wide positions, there are better candidates when the ball is close to the box in a central position. Juan Mata is chief among them - he has scored four goals directly from free-kicks for Chelsea and United since 2011. Two of them came at the tail end of last season, either side of David Moyes's sacking, against Newcastle United and Southampton. In that same period of time, Mata has also contributed three assists from free-kicks, adding to his worth with from set-piece situations. But many have predicted Mata will be the unfortunate one to lose his place as Van Gaal somehow tries to cram all his expensive players into his line-up, so step forward Wayne Rooney. The United captain has curled home five free-kicks over the last three-and-a-bit seasons and is among the best from the 18-30 yard range. Di Maria practises his free-kicks at Old Trafford prior to the match with QPR . Di Maria's (not in picture) free-kick evaded everyone in the penalty box and deceived Rob Green . Mata was on target from open play in the four-goal demolition of QPR . Last season he found the target against Crystal Palace, Manchester City and West Brom with direct free-kicks, rare moments of joy as Moyes struggled to gather points early in the campaign. And now that he has the armband, Rooney will have that little bit extra clout in those all-important negotiations at free-kicks. But he's by no means the only capable front man. Robin van Persie is also an accomplished striker of a free-kick - just ask City, who were on the receiving end of his accurate boot in the last minute of the December 2012 meeting at the Etihad. Rooney curls home a free-kick in United's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace at Old Trafford last season . Rooney celebrates his free-kick goal against Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final in March 2013 . Robin van Persie curls home his stoppage time free-kick against Manchester City in 2012 . The Dutchman can't quite match Rooney's record - he has scored with just two since 2011 - but is willing and able if needed. Last but not least is Radamel Falcao. He'll be more use in the box to get his head on the cross or pick up the scraps but the hotshot loanee striker can score direct from set pieces too, as shown by this one for Atletico Madrid against Real Sociedad in October 2012. The stats suggest Mata is the best choice but of course each situation will be different. This is one argument Van Gaal might leave to the players to sort out amongst themselves.","Louis van Gaal is blessed with plenty of accomplished free-kick takers at Manchester United .

ffe54b4f7f747d5264835c2fbf855ad67477b6b2,"By . Joe Bernstein . Having slogged his way around the lower leagues for 25 years, Sean Dyche has suddenly become popular and fashionable after taking Burnley into the promised land of the Premier League. He has been granted the flattering nickname ‘Ginger Mourinho’, while agents have been bombarding him all summer with phone calls, faxes and emails because he has money to burn. Or at least that’s what they think. The reality is a little different as Dyche is keen to point out in a typically forthright way. Ginger Mourinho: Burnley manager Sean Dyche is determined to succeed in the Premier League . On the up: Dyche led Burnley to promotion to the Premier League against all the odds last season . ‘One agent sent a message to tell me his player was available at €15million and wanted £45,000-a-week salary, net,’ he says. ‘My reply was two words: “Wrong club.” ‘I was thinking, at least do your homework. It’s not going to happen at that level at Burnley. I’m not stupid and I know we’ve got to be competitive but would I do that and rip the heart out of the club? No, it’s not my style.’ It’s neat symmetry that 24 hours after Premier League superstars like Sergio Aguero and Mesut Ozil do battle in tonight’s World Cup Final, Dyche will take his assortment of youngsters, journeymen and cut-price signings to Austria for a pre-season training camp he hopes will get them ready for the toughest challenge of their lives. Whereas Arsenal bought Alexis Sanchez for £35m this week, Dyche’s five summer signings so far have cost £2m: Michael Kightly (£1.5m), Marvin Sordell (£500,000) and freebies Matt Taylor, Matt Gilks and Steven Reid. Survival looks impossible until you start listening to Dyche. Firstly, he tells you Burnley were sixth-favourites to be relegated from The Championship last season and had only 18 outfield players to choose from. They won automatic promotion. Joy: Michael Kightly celebrates scoring the goal which ensured promotion for Burnley last season . Signings: Dyche has only spent £2m on the signings of Marvin Sordell (left), Matt Gilks (centre), Matt Taylor (right) as well as Steven Reid and Michael Kightly . Secondly, Tony Pulis and Crystal Palace showed that, with the right attitude and spirit, anything is possible. Palace were written off like Burnley and finished 11th in last season’s Premier League. Most importantly, Dyche won’t allow his squad - whose crown jewels are England under-21 striker Danny Ings and £5million-rated defender Kieran Trippier - to feel any fear. ‘We are leaving Burnley-world and going into the reality of Premier League-world but it’s not scary,’ he insists. ‘I know if you catch some of those top boys like Aguero and Sanchez when they are on a hot day, you can get badly hurt. But without being disrespectful, they are still human. They have ups and downs, no player no matter how valuable can be a magician every single week. ‘We are built on a real group mentality rather than individuals. If we bought one big star you’d get this weird thing in the camp. You’d have baggage of all the players who have done well for you whose contracts are nowhere near that of the signing you’ve just made. ‘It would hurt us so, if my chairman came to me and said “Look, we will buy that £20m player”, I would say I don’t think it is appropriate for this club at this time. It would harm the group and unquestionably we have talent here already.’ Big money: Arsenal have just spent £35m on Alexis Sanchez but Dyche will not spend beyond Burnley's means . Emulate: Dyche wants to repeat the achievements of Tony Pulis and Crystal Palace by staying up . Star men: Burnley's Keiran Trippier (left) and Danny Ings (right) could be pivotal to survival success . Burnley have been here before of course. They were in the Premier League in 2009/10 and famously beat Manchester United at Turf Moor early in the season. But manager Owen Coyle jumped ship for Bolton midway through the campaign and they were relegated. Now given a second chance, Burnley could make as much as £120m from promotion. Dyche is adamant it won’t be frittered away, and knows all about getting value for money after a 17-year playing career in the lower echelons with Chesterfield, Bristol City, Luton, Millwall, Watford and Northampton, and a short managerial stint at Watford. ‘One of the first things we did at Burnley this summer was to get the diggers in to lay new fibre sand-based training pitches. The weather up here means we need them, trust me. ‘They turn a tap on at the end of October and don’t turn it off again until the end of March. Our pitches down the bottom end of the training ground got waterlogged last season and were unusable. It’s a miracle my hair is still ginger.’ Ah, the hair. Dyche’s short, red hair and beard, coupled with a voice that is a permanent rasp, mean he is set to be one of the cult figures in the new Premier League season. Don't write us off: The work ethic which Dyche demands from his players could help keep Burnley up . Under-stated: Dyche will not get carried away by Burnley's success last season and will look to progress . Even friends like Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, who worked with Dyche at Watford, now refers to him as the ‘Ginger Mourinho’. Dyche will meet the real one when Burnley face Chelsea on the opening weekend of the season. ‘It’s just banter, isn’t it?’ smiles Dyche. ‘My mates give me some stick about the name but it’s just a bit of fun. If I do half as well as him I’ll be all right. ‘What I will say is that we are very aligned with the culture and environment we have built for the players and I don’t think that can change in any successful organisation.’ Two days in Austria have been set aside from regular football practise. One will deal with physical endurance, the other mental toughness. Last summer, the players were driven to the point of exhaustion pushing giant tyres at an army boot camp. When they were on their knees, Dyche ordered them to sprint for 60 seconds. ‘We knew we had a small group and challenges would come our way where they would be tested to the limit but we had the experience of pre-season to fall back on,’ he explains. ‘The base requirement for a footballer is that you have to be physically and mentally strong, never more so than in the Premier League where you are under constant scrutiny. ‘But out of six weeks’ pre-season, it’s only two days. The rest of the time it’s football, football, football. ‘People have pre-conceptions about me because of my appearance, they think I must shout and bawl at my players, but that is so far from the reality. ‘I like to give the players lots of information about what we do. That’s the way I wanted managers and coaches to treat me when I was a player – but it didn’t often happen.’ Apprenticeship: Dyche enjoyed a playing career in the lower leagues before becoming a manager with Watford .","Dyche slogged around in the lower leagues for 25 years before promotion .

For those who have been watching MIC recently, you'll know I've been through a rough patch, romantically - suffice to say, I'm grateful for the invention of waterproof mascara, as I've shed an ocean of tears in the last few weeks. Mummy Felstead to the rescue! 'We're going to get you through this,' she announced. Before I knew what was happening, she'd got on the phone to my friend, the singer Stacey Jackson, who just happened to be shooting the video for her new single Dance The Night Away. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky appears in Stacey Jackson's latest music video, Dance The Night Away . Together my mum and my mate arranged for me to be chauffeured to the video set and glamorously made up, so I could appear in the video. The song is a funky house number and the vid is set in a nightclub - so it called for a sultry nighttime face. I was so pleased with my look, created by brilliant make-up artist Buster Knight, that I thought I'd share it with you. STEP 1: The Face . Forget 'no make-up make-up', this is a full-on high-glamour look, which demands a flawless complexion. Buster began by prepping my skin using Clarins Instant Smooth Perfecting Touch Primer. Next he applied DiorSkin Forever Foundation all over my face, before dotting a touch of Clarins Instant Light Brush-On Perfector on top, to highlight the skin, add definition and camouflage any imperfections. Binky says that by no means is this a natural look and looks best with heavy contouring and dramatic eyes . He fixed this base in place with a dusting of Vichy Dermablend Powder, lightly applied with a big, soft brush. Finally, he contoured and highlighted my face using Daniel Sandler Sculpt and Slim Contour Kit. Last but not least, a swoosh of Guerlain Terracotta Bronzer across my cheeks and forehead gave my skin the warm, sexy glow that I love. STEP 2: The Eyes . Just as with the complexion, prepping the eye area is all-important when creating a dramatic, smoky effect like this one. Buster began by blending bareMinerals Prime Time Brightening Eye Primer across my lids. This creates a smooth base on which to apply colour, and gives your make-up added staying power, ensuring you look just as fabulous leaving the club as you did on arrival. Next, Buster buffed Daniel Sandler Sheer Satin Shadow in Gilded Taupe all over the lid and through the socket, forming a nude base. Then he ran DiorShow Fusion Mono Shadow in Nocturne along the lashes, winging it out at the corners. Using Clarins Crayon Kohl Eye Pencil in black, he intensified my lash line, before applying false eyelashes to create an ultra-glam wink, and finishing up with Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara. Finally, Buster touched up my brows using Too Faced Brow-Nie Brow Pencil, to create a strong frame for my dramatic eyes. Binky achieved her intense eyes with a darker shadow and false lashes . Binky's glamorous lips were created using a nude palette and finished with a high shine gloss and bronzer across her cheeks and forehead gave her a warm, sexy glow . STEP 3: The Lips . This look is all about the intense eyes, so Buster kept my lips luscious but neutral, framing and filling in my lips with Guerlain Lip Liner in Rose de Bulgarie. Next he applied Dior Rouge Couture Colour Lipstick in Ambre Zemire, followed by a sexy slick of Clarins Gloss Prodige in Papaya for the final glamorous touch. If you'd like to recreate this look, you can purchase all the products you need at online beauty boutique, Escentual.com. When Buster had finishing working on my face, I felt newly gorgeous and ready to party. Stacey and I went straight from dancing in the video shoot to dancing all night in a club, with our sultry faces still in place. It was the perfect girly pick-me-up! As all you girls know, you can't beat a bit of retail therapy when you're feeling glum, so I treated myself to some gorgeous new bits from my fave lingerie brand Bluebella. I picked up the Skylar bra and briefs; the pale hue is perfect for spring and I love the girly ruffle detailing. It's a playful, whimsical set with a touch of naughtiness in the form of the sheer fabric - j'adore! The tears are drying and Binky's back!

But speaking to students in Calcutta he revealed how the blizzard of issues which are thrown at him can leave him struggling to cope. He said: ‘It’s like sometimes being in a sort of asteroid shower, things flying at you every day. ‘You know, “Should you go to Sri Lanka?”, “What are you going to do about the famine in the Philippines?”, “Why has this minister done that?’ All these things are coming at you”.’ Mr Cameron said he coped by having a firm idea of what he is trying to achieve while in government or he will lose his way. ‘You’ve got to have a plan,’ he said. Earlier the Prime Minister admitted that the coalition government has made decisions that are not in the national interest. He said the Liberal Democrats have forced him into adopting policies that could damage Britain 'in the long term'. Shower: Cameron said he had to deal with a flurry of questions about international crises and gaffe-prone ministers . But Deputy PM Nick Clegg hit back, insisting blocking some Tory policies was the 'right' thing to do. With 18 months to go until the general election, both parties have begun striking out to provide greater ‘differentiation’ from their coalition partners. The Conservatives have placed greater emphasis on crime, immigration and Europe while the Lib Dems have focussed on the environment and blocking visa curbs. Speaking in Delhi, Mr Cameron told an audience of politicians and businessmen: 'I would prefer not to have a Coalition. 'We’ve shown it can work. And actually the good parts of Coalition are because you have these arguments within government and you have to proceed on a rational basis – that’s good. 'I think what’s bad about it is that sometimes you have to make compromises that are not necessarily in the long-term interests of the country.' Tour: Mr Cameron also tried some Indian snacks from a street food stall during his visit . But Mr Clegg was defiant about his role in blocking Conservative policies to allow employers to fire at will, allow schools to make profits and giving spy agencies more powers in the Snooper’s Charter.  to be shelved. 'Of course there are compromises that the Conservatives have made that they don’t like,' he said on his weekly LBC 97.3 radio phone-in. 'I so happen to think that with the Liberal Democrats in coalition government, we have not only proved that coalition government works but that it is still anchored in the centre ground.'","David Cameron reveals the struggle to cope with flurry of questions .

Members of the university’s Conservative Association were alleged to have given renditions of the song that revels in the killing of Jews during ‘port and policy’ nights. One video, filmed in the common room at Corpus Christi college, is said to show a student drunkenly chanting: ‘Dashing through the Reich’, before being silenced by another member. Oxford University Conservative Association president James Lawson with a friend. They were not involved in the alleged racist singing . The song’s full version, to the tune of Jingle Bells, continues: ‘Dashing through the Reich / in a black Mercedes Benz / killing lots of kike / ra ta ta ta ta.’ The word ‘kike’ is a derogatory term for Jewish people. One member of the Conservative Association, who declined to be named, told the Oxford Student newspaper: ‘Lots of people were singing it that night, and indeed on many other nights, and the general attitude is that that was OK. ‘The thing is, lots of members do find that song, and songs like that one, absolutely despicable, though little is done to stop it. I am very worried with the direction the society is going in at present.’ Pictures taken from ‘port and policy’ nights during the past year also showed members of the society rolling . around drunk on the floor. One was photographed pouring port into a friend’s mouth through a pith helmet. Excess: A member drinks port poured through a pith helmet. Neither was involved in the Nazi singing . Another . photo shows two members dressed as Margaret Thatcher next to a coal . miner outfit bearing an offensive placard which reads: ‘I love . shafting.’ Last night, Joe . Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative . Association, told the Daily Mail he was resigning from it in protest . about the ‘debauched’ behaviour of many of his fellow members. The . third year PPE student said: ‘It is disgusting and goes against . everything the Conservative Party stands for. I am completely . disillusioned. 'I came from a single-parent family and went to a state . school and had to work for everything I have achieved. ‘But . unfortunately the majority of members are rich former public schoolboys . with a great sense of entitlement who are far more interested in . drinking port than discussing policy.’ A former treasurer of the association recently wrote to members to complain about the ‘excessive and crass’ singing at meetings. He wrote: ‘The dissonance is enough to inflict pain as short, spotty, still-pubescent boys struggle to fix their unsteady voices on any pitch at all. ‘This unbridled clamour is disturbing finalists who live near the Union, many of whom are sounder Conservatives than most, but who don’t feel the need to dress up in ridiculous clothes or pretend that we still have an empire.’ David Cameron and former Tory leaders Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith have all given talks to the association in recent years. Its former presidents include Cabinet members William Hague and Jeremy Hunt. The OUCA is affiliated with Conservative Future, the party’s youth wing, and regularly supports candidates in local elections. During last year’s General Election, five former presidents stood for parliamentary seats. The Nazi song allegation is just the latest controversy to hit the association in recent years. Two years ago it was temporarily banned from using Oxford University in its title after members were urged to compete to see who could tell the most offensive racist joke. Yesterday an Oxford University spokesman said: ‘The university proctors, who are responsible for discipline, have been made aware of the [Oxford Student] article and will be considering whether there are grounds for further investigation. ‘The university strongly condemns any form of racism or discrimination.’ James Lawson, the current president of the Conservative Association who took over after the alleged racist singing took place, said he had started an investigation into the allegations. He said: ‘If it turns out this person is a member we will take immediate action to expel them from the association. Racism has no place in the association or our society.’ Additional reporting by James Rothwell .",One video said to show student singing 'Dashing through the Reich' to tune of Jingle Bells .

The homeless older brother of billionaire pop star Madonna required nine stitches to his forehead after he resisted arrest in a public bathroom in northern Michigan, police revealed Tuesday. Law enforcement officials were called in Sunday night when 56-year-old Anthony Ciccone refused to leave the bathroom at the Grand Traverse County Civic Center. Police say a female officer attempted to arrest Ciccone on an outstanding warrant for trespass, but he showed resistance. Down on his luck: Anthony Ciccone, 56, Madonna's older brother, had to get nine stitches after being slammed to the floor by an officer during an arrest on an outstanding trespass warrant . In response, the responding police officer brought the unruly 56-year-old man to the ground. As a result, Ciccone's face hit the bathroom floor. He was taken to Munson Medical Center, where he received several stitches. Police say at the time of his arrest, Ciccone's blood-alcohol level was 0.40, which is five times the legal limit in Michigan. No attorney is listed for Ciccone, who was arraigned on the warrant and jailed. Madonna's publicist, Liz Rosenberg, declined to comment. Madonna is a Michigan native. Police received a 911 call at around 11pm Sunday reporting that a man was refusing to leave a detached bathroom and challenged a cleaning crew at the Grand Traverse County Civic Center on West Civic Center Drive. Different paths: Anthony Ciccone (left) has been homeless for the past three years, struggling to survive on the snowy streets of Michigan, while his sister Madonna (right), recently reached $1billion in net worth . Traverse City Police Capt Brian Heffner told the Traverse City Record-Eagle that Madonna’s 56-year-old sibling confronted the responding officer in an aggressive manner when she attempted to restrain and arrest him on an outstanding trespassing warrant. 'She turned him around and brought him to the ground, which is when he struck his face on the bathroom floor,' Heffner said. According to authorities, the warrant stemmed from a March incident when Ciccone was reclining in front of a fireplace at Horizon Books and refused to leave. Ciccone was arraigned Monday on the trespassing warrant and ordered held without bond in the Grand Traverse County Jail. Anthony, the oldest of the seven living Ciccone siblings, has been living on the streets for the past three years, during which time he had several run-ins with the law. He recently spent a month in jail after being arrested drunk in a church and swearing in front of children. A family divided: Madonna (centre) with her siblings (from left-to-right): Anthony (now homeless in Michigan), Jennifer, Paula, Christopher, Mario, Melanie and Marty pictured in 1986 . Recently, the 56-year-old homeless man suffering from an alcohol addicito9n told MailOnline that his glamorous 54-year-old sister, whose net worth stands at $1billion, does not care if he is dead or alive. 'I never loved her in the first place, she never loved me. We never loved each other,' her told MailOnline in an interview last week. Anthony Ciccone lost his job at the family vineyard owned by his father, Tony, and his stepmother, Joan, after being found sprawled on his back drinking wine straight from the vats. 'My father would be very happy if I died of hypothermia and then he would not have to worry about it anymore. He’s old school, he grew up in the depression,' the 56-year-old said. However, a family friend who works at the Ciccone vineyard claims that Anthony's parents are terrified that he might die any day, but refuse to take him back until he cleans up his act and quits drinking.

ffe6fe6c60a3f747c290457d10f9e8c5a9a12239,"An e. You can write it with one fluid swoop of a pen or one tap of the keyboard. The most commonly used letter in the English dictionary. Simple, right? Now imagine it printed out millions of times on thousands of forms and documents. Then think of how much ink would be needed. OK, so that may have been a first for you, but it came naturally to 14-year-old Suvir Mirchandani when he was trying to think of ways to cut waste and save money at his Pittsburgh-area middle school. It all started as a science fair project. As a neophyte sixth-grader at Dorseyville Middle School, Suvir noticed he was getting a lot more handouts than he did in elementary school. Interested in applying computer science to promote environmental sustainability, Suvir decided he was going to figure out if there was a better way to minimize the constant flurry of paper and ink. Reducing paper use through recycling and dual-sided printing had been talked about before as a way to save money and conserve resources, but there was less attention paid to the ink for which the paper served as a canvas for history and algebra handouts. ""Ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,"" Suvir says with a chuckle. He's right: Chanel No. 5 perfume costs $38 per ounce, while the equivalent amount of Hewlett-Packard printer ink can cost up to $75. So Suvir decided to focus his project on finding ways to cut down on the costly liquid. Collecting random samples of teachers' handouts, Suvir concentrated on the most commonly used characters (e, t, a, o and r). First, he charted how often each character was used in four different typefaces: Garamond, Times New Roman, Century Gothic and Comic Sans. Then he measured how much ink was used for each letter, using a commercial tool called APFill® Ink Coverage Software. Next he enlarged the letters, printed them and cut them out on cardstock paper to weigh them to verify his findings. He did three trials for each letter, graphing the ink usage for each font. From this analysis, Suvir figured out that by using Garamond with its thinner strokes, his school district could reduce its ink consumption by 24%, and in turn save as much as $21,000 annually. Encouraged by his teacher, Suvir looked to publish his findings and stumbled on the Journal for Emerging Investigators (JEI), a publication founded by a group of Harvard grad students in 2011 that provides a forum for the work of middle school and high school students. It has the same standards as academic journals, and each submission is reviewed by grad students and academics. Sarah Fankhauser, one of JEI's founders, says that of the nearly 200 submissions they have received since 2011, Suvir's project was a real standout: . ""We were so impressed. We really could really see the real-world application in Suvir's paper."" Fankhauser said Suvir's findings were so clear, simple and well thought-out, it had the peer reviewers at JEI asking, ""How much potential savings is really out there?"" For the answer, JEI challenged Suvir to apply his project to a larger scale: the federal government. With an annual printing expenditure of $1.8 billion, the government was a much more challenging task than his school science project. Suvir repeated his tests on five sample pages from documents on the Government Printing Office website and got similar results -- change the font, save money. Will government printers embrace a change? Using the General Services Administration's estimated annual cost of ink -- $467 million -- Suvir concluded that if the federal government used Garamond exclusively it could save nearly 30% -- or $136 million per year. An additional $234 million could be saved annually if state governments also jumped on board, he reported. Gary Somerset, media and public relations manager at the Government Printing Office, describes Suvir's work as ""remarkable."" But he was noncommittal on whether the GPO would introduce changes to typeface, saying the GPO's efforts to become more environmentally sustainable were focused on shifting content to the Web. ""In 1994, we were producing 20,000 copies a day of both the Federal Register and Congressional Record. Twenty years later, we produce roughly 2,500 print copies a day,"" he said. On top of this, the Congressional Register is printed on recycled paper, which GPO has been doing for five or six years, Somerset says. One federal initiative that focuses on minimizing ink-usage is called ""Printwise."" Implemented 18 months ago by the General Services Administration, it teaches government offices how to default their computer settings to Times New Roman, Garamond and Century Gothic to minimize printing waste. According to GSA's press secretary Dan Cruz, they hope this type of initiative could ultimately save the federal government up to $30 million annually. Suvir appreciates the government's efforts, but he sees his project as a means of making an even bigger impact nationwide. ""Consumers are still printing at home, they can make this change too,"" he says. Holding out hope . At 14, Suvir understands how difficult such a project might be to implement -- ""I recognize it's difficult to change someone's behavior. That's the most difficult part."" But he holds out hope: ""I definitely would love to see some actual changes and I'd be happy to go as far as possible to make that change possible."" With decades ahead to lend a hand, Suvir and other young men and women like him may even be able to untangle some of the knotty political and technical issues that beset Washington, corporate suites and the world at large.

The two racist thugs convicted of murdering Stephen Lawrence were awarded a total of £425,000 of legal aid, official figures reveal. Gary Dobson, 37, and David Norris, 36, each received more than £200,000  of taxpayers’ money to fight their  murder charges. The amount of money claimed by the teenager’s killers emerged days after  the Government vowed to crack down on ‘fat-cat’ legal aid solicitors and barristers. After a six-month freedom of information battle with the authorities, the Mail has finally been given details of the amount of legal aid claimed by Dobson and Norris, both jailed for life in January last year after being convicted of Stephen’s 1993 murder. Our initial request in December last year was turned down by the now defunct Legal Services Commission because the pair were appealing their convictions and officials ruled that disclosing the figures could prejudice any potential retrial. But Dobson has since dropped his legal challenge and Norris’s bid to clear his name has been thrown out by the Appeal Court. The figures provided to the Mail show drug trafficker Dobson was awarded £199,109 of legal aid in the run-up to and during his murder trial, and a further £4,200 for his doomed appeal. Gangster’s son Norris received £222,346 in legal aid to defend the murder charge. Details of how much public money, if any, he received to fund his appeal have not been finalised. Their combined legal aid awards come to £425,655 and dwarf the £320,000 compensation paid to Stephen’s parents Doreen and Neville Lawrence for police bungles that hampered their quest for justice. The Crown Prosecution Service’s counsel fees for the prosecution and related hearings was £287,056. Dobson’s legal team was headed by Timothy Roberts QC, while Stephen Batten QC led Norris’s defence. After a six-week trial, an Old Bailey jury ruled in January last year that Dobson and Norris were guilty of murdering Stephen, 18, in Eltham, south-east London in April 1993. The pair, who were among a gang of five racist thugs who stabbed Stephen to death, were jailed for life. The verdicts were a victory for the Daily Mail, which since 1997 has campaigned for justice for the  Lawrence family. After their convictions, Norris launched an appeal, claiming that the use of a surveillance video in evidence was prejudicial. (Pictured left) Gary Dobson: £203,309 in aid and (pictured right) David Norris: £222,346 in aid . In the film, shot 20 months after Stephen’s murder, Norris was secretly filmed telling friends he wanted to torture and kill black people. His lawyers said the video did not prove he was involved in Stephen’s murder and should not have been admitted as evidence. The footage also showed Dobson using violent, racist language. He was seen recalling a time he threatened a black colleague with a knife. Lawyers for Norris also objected to the way prosecutors presented scientific evidence in the trial. The breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold-case team of forensic scientists were called in. They found tiny traces of blood, hair and fibres on clothing seized from the pair’s homes. The defence claimed this was the result of contamination, but that was rejected by the jury. This March, just over a month before the 20th anniversary of the murder, Dobson finally dropped the appeal against his conviction. In May, Norris lost a second attempt to challenge his conviction when he was refused permission to appeal by the Court of Appeal. Met chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has told the Mail he has no plans to close the investigation into Stephen’s murder, which puts pressure on the three other members of the gang that killed Stephen, brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt and their friend Luke Knight, who have not been convicted. Hopes of a breakthrough in the long-running murder probe rose in April after police said a 20th anniversary appeal for information had prompted ‘two very significant’ phone calls. Last week, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the amount paid out in legal aid was ‘unsustainable’, adding that taxpayers could not keep footing the bill for a system said to cost £2billion a year. A spokesman for the Legal Aid Agency, which replaced the LSC, said: ‘Anyone on trial for a serious criminal offence can apply for legal aid so a lawyer can represent them in court. Funding is subject to a means test which could require  the defendant to pay towards their legal costs.’","Gary Dobson, 37, and David Norris,  36, each received more than £200,000 of taxpayers’ money to fight their murder charges .

ffe82e006c68bace26f1be1de78d181c2af6a780,"Incheon, South Korea (CNN) -- A small army of elite, highly trained clones are sent on a mission to root out drugs and ammunition from the city. Every few hours they report back to their masters, to whom they've been devoted since birth. But this isn't the set of a low-budget sci-fi flick; it's the departure lounge of South Korea's Incheon Airport, where seven ""super clone"" sniffer-dogs have been dispatched in the war against contraband luggage. The pack of golden Labrador Retrievers are all genetically identical to ""Chase,"" whose legendary snout kept him top of Incheon's drug-detection rankings right up until his retirement in 2007. But now after years of training, the new class is following in their genetic donor's paw-prints, consistently outperforming the rest of South Korea's naturally born sniffers in the hunt for heroin, cocaine and methamphetamines. Interactive: A day in the life of an airport city . They are the work of Professor Byeong-chun Lee, who established his reputation in 2005 as the driving force behind Snuppy (an amalgam of Seoul National University puppy), the world's first ever dog clone. ""The officers in Korean Custom Service read our dog-cloning article and they suggested the project to us,"" recalls Lee. Indeed, Korean customs had a problem on their hands. Only three out of every 10 selectively bred sniffer dogs that it trained --- at a cost of about $40,140 each -- had the nostrils and the discipline for the job. Although the seven Labrador clones cost upwards of $100,000 each, every single one of them made the grade. But Lee refuses to take all the credit: ""I think half of the ability comes from the genetic background and half comes from the training,"" he said. Lending weight, if it were needed, to the claim that aptitude is indeed a balance of nature and nurture, the dogs still display variations in performance despite their identical genes. And leader of the pack is Tutu. ""Last year, he won a medal for detecting the most drugs at the ICN (Incheon) airport,"" boasts his long-time handler Park Ji-yong. Like his septuplet brothers, Tutu began training for the job at the age one and now, as a mature four year-old, works five to six hourly shifts a day. ""He's very active and energetic...He's kind of tough...and he only likes me which makes me feel good,"" beams Ji-yong. But it's not just drug-mules and meth-addicts that need fear the arrival of this sniffing super-breed. Lee's next clone will be a high-performance ""quarantine dog"" -- gifted with an enhanced capacity for detecting the presence of disease in humans. Lee says that, due to the high number of travelers passing through Incheon, the airport has experienced problems with the spread of infectious diseases, ""so the Korean government have asked us to clone some quarantine sniffing dogs"" Beyond the airport barriers, Professor Lee spends his time cloning a variety of other canine breeds, each with a specific purpose in mind. ""Some clients want to replicate their own pets"" says Lee. In other cases, the scientist works in conservation, creating identical copies of endangered animals. ""Wolves are endangered species in Korea, especially grey wolves. We collected cells from the ear of wolves...and transported to surrogate dogs and finally we produced cloned wolves"" says Lee. So, now that he's cloned man's best friend, are there any plans for man himself? ""Scientifically all the animals, including humans, can be cloned, but I have never thought about (it). It's illegal and it's an ethical problem.""","A breed of 'super clone' sniffer dogs is in action at Incheon Airport .

ffe83695834b28bc6b364393aa17e2976849d8a1,"(Financial Times) -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp was on Tuesday facing a fresh barrage of allegations over its business practices after an Australian newspaper released 14,000 emails concerning one of the group's security subsidiaries. The emails, said to be from the hard drive of a former head of security at NDS, a former News Corp subsidiary, appear to show that the company paid computer hackers to work with its ""operational security"" unit. The cache sheds further light on commercial disputes between News Corp and pay-TV rivals that now span Australasia, Europe, and the US. The Australian Financial Review claimed that NDS's activities in Australia in 1999 caused millions of dollars of damage to Mr Murdoch's rivals in the country's nascent pay-TV market. The business models of Austar, Optus and Foxtel were all damaged by a wave of high-tech piracy at that time. The Australian newspaper said the emails had originated from the computer of Ray Adams, a former commander in the Metropolitan Police in London, who served as head of operational security for NDS in Europe from 1996 to 2002. NDS had no immediate comment but News Corp said: ""News Corporation is proud to have worked with NDS, whose industry-leading technology has transformed TV viewing for millions of people across the world, and to have supported them in their aggressive fight against piracy and copyright infringement."" Allegations of fierce competitive behaviour, which were not illegal under Australian law at the time, the AFR said, came a day after the BBC's Panorama programme levelled similar charges against NDS's conduct in the UK. The television programme said that NDS used hackers to crack the security of the encryption cards of OnDigital, the UK broadcaster ITV's entrant in the pay-television market, which went bust in 2002 in the face of competition by News Corp's British Sky Broadcasting unit. In one email purportedly from the hard drive, NDS employees discuss the fact that a European pay-TV company which News Corp was poised to take a stake in was ""totally hacked"" by pirates. The sender of the email debated whether, in light of the News Corp interest in the company, NDS should ""start to protect [the particular model of encryption used by the company] while leaving the main . . . platform compromised"". In a detailed statement after the Panorama programme, NDS denied ever using hackers against other companies. ""Like most companies in the conditional access industry -- and many law enforcement agencies -- NDS uses industry contacts to track and catch both hackers and pirates. This is neither illegal nor unethical. And, to ensure that all activity remains completely within legal bounds, NDS staff and their contacts operate under a clear code of conduct for operating undercover. ""These allegations were the subject of a long-running court case in the United States. This concluded with NDS being totally vindicated and its accuser having to pay almost $19m in costs -- a point that the BBC neglected to include."" Some of the emails released on Tuesday played a part in that case, where the US pay-TV platform Echostar won part of its claim, but was awarded trivial damages and was ordered to pay NDS's costs. In the Panorama programme, Mr Adams denied ever having seen or handled encryption codes or cards that would have allowed anyone to hack OnDigital's machines. Tom Watson, the opposition Labour MP who has led British parliamentary investigations into Mr Murdoch's group and the UK phone hacking scandal, said he had written to the broadcasting regulator Ofcom, asking it to include the Panorama allegations in its inquiry into whether News Corp and its executives were ""fit and proper"" to own a broadcasting licence. To date, 22 people have been arrested in connection with the phone hacking investigation at the News of the World newspaper. A separate UK police investigation is looking into alleged corrupt payments to public officials by journalists at The Sun.

Lampard arrives late in the box to score City's equaliser and deny Chelsea three points at the Etihad . VIDEO Lampard City deal extended . It was a small thing, a minor detail, but he was the only England player doing it. That discipline was instilled at a young age, when he chose to ignore the taunts of Martyn Mullen, one of the promising players coming through the youth set up with him at West Ham. ‘Oi, Lampard, what the **** are you doing?’ Mullen shouted across when he saw the young midfielder out on his own after training doing his doggies. It got a laugh from the other players and Lampard has never forgotten it. To this day, he still does them. When he is off the training field and away with the team, he spends time plotting the next move in the London property market. The 36-year-old holds his hands up and looks to the skies after scoring what must have been an emotional goal for the former Chelsea man . Between him and his dad, Frank Lampard Snr, they own half of the capital, or at least it seems that way. They are family who have always planned for the future. Lampard could have taken the easy route during his loan spell at City, going through the motions and keeping himself ticking over until he starts his new career with New York City. Instead he has even surprised City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini with his exceptional attitude and commitment to the game. At the World Cup, even though he knew he was no longer a first-choice midfield player, Lampard took on extra responsibilities. Lampard was a dedicated servant to his national team, earning 106 caps and scoring 29 goals for England . The Chelsea legend celebrates scoring his record breaking 203rd goal for the Premier League club . Lampard poses for a photoshoot with a load of footballs after breaking the Chelsea goalscoring record . He was a comfort blanket for many of the players, an emotional crutch for the youngsters in Roy Hodgson’s England squad. When he spoke with the media, he held the room so well - particularly once when he sat with Raheem Sterling - that he sounded like the manager. One day he should be. He has all the requirements. Lampard (left) won everything with Chelsea, including the Premier League title in 2005 . Starting out at West Ham, Lampard went on to spend 13 happy years at Stamford Bridge . Lampard is a smart guy, responding in Latin to a Manchester City official who had also studied the language when they were at school. Football is Lampard’s first language, though. He wanted to play on Sunday - in any event Premier League rules meant he had to be available - and there was never any doubt that he would give anything other than 100 per cent. When he steered City’s equaliser beyond Thibaut Courtois, he was respectful and dignified, but that goal meant more than many of the 211 he scored in a Chelsea shirt. It proved to Lampard that he could still live with the game at this level. Lampard may have scored for City on Sunday, but the midfielder will always be a Chelsea hero . ‘I don’t speak about former players,’ was Jose Mourinho’s narky response following Lampard’s incredible impact on the game at the Etihad. It was Mourinho’s decision to let Lampard leave when Cesc Fabregas let it be known that Barcelona were prepared to sell him. During those fabulous tussles between the pair, when Fabregas was the chirpy upstart in an Arsenal shirt and Lampard was the main man in Chelsea’s midfield, they never got along. It was obvious, watching Lampard’s body language and demeanour, that he was determined to impose himself in every area of the midfield during those combative and compelling clashes. In all those fights, Fabregas never got the better of the Englishman in the centre of midfield. Even at 36, Lampard still dedicates more time on the training field than most other players . Andre Schurrle fires Chelsea ahead in the clash of the title rivals at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday . On Sunday, Lampard still had the upper hand after coming on to score that equaliser when City were down to 10 men. He is sensible enough to know that this cannot last for ever, that his time as a top class Premier League player will come to an end when he leaves for New York City in January. When the City option came up - initially he was supposed to play for Sheikh Mansour’s team in Australia - he spoke with his father  about his emotional attachment to Chelsea. Lampard will have wanted to get the upper hand of Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas (centre) It was pointed out to him that the great Bobby Moore, who was idolised by Frank Snr as a young professional at West Ham, went on to play for Fulham later in his career. He was still, quite rightly, cherished down at the Boleyn. Lampard - or Super Frank, as he is known at Stamford Bridge - is Chelsea through and through. Despite his goal on Sunday, they are still his team.","Frank Lampard is the ultimate professional and Chelsea will always be his club .

This is the moment the president and COO of discount chain Family Dollar is fired during an episode of television show ‘Undercover Boss.’ Michael Bloom was fired by a warehouse supervisor because he was unable to safely operate a forklift. Rosali, a supervisor and forklift operator in a Virginia warehouse, fired a man he thought was named Mark. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'I have to let you go': Rosali (left) fired Mr Bloom (right) for incompetence after only a few hours . 'Mark,' as Mr Bloom was called, told Family Dollar employees he was on a reality show competing for his own business. Forklift operator was one of a handful of jobs ‘Mark’ undertook within the company while on the CBS show. He made multiple mistakes with the forklift that put multiple people in danger. From blowing through stop signals to ignoring other safeguards, ‘Mark’ was a terrible forklift operator. ‘Mark, I gotta tell you this,’ Rosali said to the covert COO. ‘I wouldn’t be comfortable leaving you alone doing this.’ ‘I will have to, you know, let you go,’ he continued. Woah, easy!: 'Mark' clumsily operates the forklift, causing Rosali to tell him to be more gentle . Stop signs are not suggestive: 'Mark' also blew through a stop sign - a big no no . 'Test drive': 'Mark's troubles begin shortly after takes the reigns of the forklift . The astonished exec was almost speechless being fired for a low-level position from the company he runs on national television. ‘Just for that… I get fired for one little mistake,’ said ‘Mark.’ ‘Yeah,’ Rosali confirmed. Rosali further defended his decision in a follow up interview added to the broadcast. ‘I have to fire Mark for safety reasons,’ he said. ‘I don’t want him to have an accident or hurt anybody else.’ A stern warning: 'Mark' was only at the controls a few minutes before receiving his first warning . If only he knew: Rosali did not know 'Mark' was actually Mr Bloom as he fired him in this scene . Wait, what?: Rosali fired 'Mark' for incompetence before even finishing his first day . Water under the bridge: Mr Bloom offered to pay off $12,000 in debt and gave Rosali a promotion with a 40 per cent raise . The banished boss was surprisingly upbeat about being booted from the warehouse. ‘It’s a little embarrassing, but I’m glad to see that he takes safety so seriously,’ he said during his walk of shame. Mr Bloom revealed himself to Rosali later in the episode. He showed no ill will towards the man for firing him. The bigwig offered to pay off two-thirds of Rosali’s $18,000 credit card debt and promoted him to a salaried managerial position with a 40 per cent pay raise. ‘Thank you, I’ll do my best, I can do it,’ Rosali said. ‘I know you can,’ Mr Bloom replied. Mr Bloom has been the president and COO of Family Dollar since 2011. His total compensation last year came out to just over $3.5million, according to Bloomberg.","Family Dollar president and COO Mike Bloom went on 'Undercover Boss' and was fired .

ffe8c0fbb871fc4f2ae157ca4dff310c8021a43c,"The world’s most powerful investment bank was last night accused of being ‘oblivious’ to public opinion after paying its staff almost a quarter of a million pounds last year on average. Goldman Sachs yesterday cemented its position as the world’s most generous big bank, dishing out £8.4billion in pay and perks for 2014. The Wall Street giant, which employs 6,000 people in London, confirmed its 34,000 staff around the world received an average package of £246,000. Astonishingly, the sum – which is almost ten times the average salary in the UK and dwarfs the Prime Minister’s £142,500 package – represents a small pay cut. Goldman Sachs confirmed its 34,000 staff around the world received an average package of £246,000. File photo . Staff received £248,000 on average in 2013. The figure includes salary, bonuses and benefits, including healthcare and pensions. The announcement came as Goldman revealed its profits rose 5pc last year to £5.6billion. Goldman is set to confirm multi million pound bonuses for top executives, including boss Lloyd Blankfein and UK supremo Michael Sherwood, in separate filings to US regulators next week. Deborah Hargreaves, boss of campaign group the High Pay Centre said: ‘This is a further sign that the banking industry - and particularly Goldman Sachs - is completely oblivious to public opinion about bonuses and believes the only way to reward employees is through money.’ Banks on both sides of the Atlantic have been criticised for continuing to award eye watering sums to its staff, despite evidence that the bonus culture encouraged the reckless behaviour which helped to trigger the financial crisis. But Goldman has earned itself the nickname ‘Goldmine Sacks’ for consistently paying more than its rivals as it has consolidated its position as the most powerful investment bank in the world. Just before New Year it sneaked out details of a £367million pay bonanza for its top London staff for 2013. The huge sum was shared between 121 Goldman Sachs bosses and traders, at an average of £3million a head. Astonishingly, the sum represents a small pay cut as the average package was £248,000 in 2012. Pictured, the Goldman Sachs Group global headquarters In New York . This equated to almost £60,000 a week, more than 120 times the average wage. The average pay package of £246,000 for all staff last year dwarfs those on offer at Goldman’s rivals. On Wednesday JP Morgan - which employs 11,000 people in the UK,. became the first US bank to publish its annual figures for last year. It paid £135,000 on average to its 51,129 investment bankers. Goldman Sachs insists it has been showing more restraint since the financial crisis. Last year, staff pocketed just under 37 pc of its earnings – before the crisis it routinely paid out more than 40pc. Its chief executive Lloyd Blankfein - who once claimed that banks ‘do God’s work’ - has also seen his pay cut. His £14million pay package is a far cry from the £45million he was awarded before the financial crisis set in in 2007. The UK banks are set to announce their pay and bonuses for last year in the coming weeks, but they are likely to be much smaller on average than those awarded at Goldman. But Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio is in line for a £7million windfall after hitting a number of performance targets, including returning the bank to profit and helping to push up its share price. This award, which dates back to 2011, will come on top of his £4million pay package for 2014. Labour have pledged to reintroduce a tax on bankers’ bonuses if they win the general election in May.","Investment bank was accused of being ‘oblivious’ to public opinion .

ffe978b67b714ee65d54d21f2e8ebff56ed42062,"After three months of closure, the Lindt Chocolate Café at the centre of the Sydney Siege is set to reopen in a matter of days. The scene of one of Australia’s most infamous terror attacks, workers at the Sydney CBD café said the café told The Daily Telegraph the shop will reopen by the end of the week. The café made headlines around the world in December when Islamic extremist Man Haron Monis held staff and patrons hostage there for about 17 hours. Repairs are currently under way at the Martin Place cafe after it was damaged during the siege that claimed the lives of cafe manager Tori Johnson and barrister Katrina Dawson in December. Lindt officially confirmed on Thursday they would reopen the cafe. 'After the tragic events that happened at the end of last year, we feel this is the right thing to do, to move forward and to push on in a positive way,' a spokesman said. Scroll down for video . The Lindt cafe at Martin Place will reopen in mid-March with a memorial to honour the bravery of the hostages and the two victims who died in the Sydney siege . Lindt Cafe manager Tori Johnson (left, pictured opening the Martin Place cafe in 2013) and barrister Katrina Dawson were both killed during the siege . 'We have taken this decision after careful consideration of a number of factors, the most important of which was consultation with our staff, whom feel positive about this decision and believe this is the best way forward.' The final opening date hasn't been announced but Lindt said they were working on plans for a memorial in the cafe to remember those affected. 'We are still confirming what the memorial will look like, as these things do take a little bit of time, but we feel this is fitting and appropriate to remember their bravery,' the spokesman said. Tori Johnson, 34, Katrina Dawson, 38, and the gunman who held them hostage for more than 16 hours were all killed. It was revealed at a coronial inquest last month that Mr Johnson was shot in the head at point blank range by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis after being forced to kneel on the cafe floor. Ms Dawson was killed by fragments of ricocheting bullets fired by police when they stormed the cafe soon after Mr Johnson was killed. Repairs are currently under way at the Martin Place cafe after it was damaged during the siege . Lindt officially confirmed on Thursday they would reopen the cafe after speaking with staff . The final opening date hasn't been announced but Lindt said they were working on plans for a memorial in the cafe to remember those affected . Some of the hostages who were held alongside Mr Johnson and Ms Dawson shared the agony and fear they felt in televised interviews on 60 Minutes and Seven News this week. They told of how Monis forced them to call emergency services to tell them his demands, and how the gunman became more frustrated as night fell. Louisa Hope, 52, who suffers from multiple sclerosis and needs a walking stick to move around, was one of the hostages that failed to get away and told 60 Minutes how she saw Mr Johnson die. 'When the noise of the gun, and then Tori fell forward... He hasn't just died, his life has been taken,' she said. Hostage Marcia Mikhael, 43, said Monis, who had a history of violence and extremism, told her he had a 'plan' to die in the standoff. A total of 18 people were taken hostage and were forced by captor Man Haron Monis to hold an Islamic flag up to the windows during the siege . Hostage Marcia Mikhael, 43, said Monis, who had a history of violence and extremism, told her he had a 'plan' to die in the standoff . Louisa Hope (pictured) who suffers from multiple sclerosis and needs a walking stick to move around, was one of the hostages that failed to get away and told 60 Minutes how she saw Mr Johnson die . 'I knew he didn't want to get out of there alive and because of that, I was very scared about how it was going to end,' she told Channel Seven. Ms Mikhael said she was beside Ms Dawson as police charged into the cafe, shortly after Ms Johnson was killed. 'There were just so many shots. I could smell the gunpower, I could feel the heat... It was so bright, everyone was just lit up as if it was New Year's Eve,' she said. 'And then all of a sudden it stopped... and I could see police officers wearing the black uniform. 'She wasn't moving. She was just lying down with her head facing me, looking at me.' Harriette Denny, who was 13 weeks pregnant when the siege unfolded, revealed she thought the gunman was going to shoot them in full view of the public. Ms Hope, 52, said Tori Johnson wasn't just killed, his life was taken from him . People run with there hands up from the Lindt Cafe, Martin Place during a hostage standoff on December 16 . 'You lose hope, thinking about your family outside, thinking there's nothing you can do to get yourself out and it's very hard,' she told 60 Minutes. John O'Brien, 82, said Monis was 'ranting and raving' about Prime Minister Tony Abbott and threatened to kill everyone in the cafe. 'Tony Abbott wouldn't come to the phone, he said Tony Abbott will have all your blood on his hands when I kill you all, one by one,' Mr O'Brien told Channel Seven. The interviews, for which channels Seven and Nine reportedly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars, came just over a week after an inquest opened into the siege. In their store reopening announcement, Lindt encouraged people to visit the charity page set up in Mr Johnson's honour. 'Tori was someone who had a very positive approach to life and this page was set up in Tori's memory after the event to raise funds for beyondblue, a charity chosen by his family,' the spokesman said. 'We know that all concerned, including Tori's family, are deeply grateful for the donations being made.' A permanent tribute will be put in place at the Lindt cafe in Martin Place when it reopens to honour the memory of the victims, Tori Johnson (pictured) and Katrina Dawson .

ffea0c8b29307469dea5cd49fd381ff7f656d5e5,"By . Sam Webb . A builder who battered and stabbed his ex-girlfriend’s father and then poured petrol over him before setting him alight was today jailed for a minimum of 27 years for his murder. James Carbott, 31, beat Thomas Baird with a crowbar and stabbed him with a retractable blade knife inside his bungalow in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. He left, but returned to destroy evidence by dousing petrol on 63-year-old Mr Baird, who was lying on his doorstep and was either dead or dying. He set his body and the victim’s bungalow alight. James Carbott, 31, beat Thomas Baird with a crowbar and stabbed him with a retractable blade knife inside his bungalow. He later set the body alight. He was today jailed for a minimum of 27 years . Sentencing him to life at St Albans Crown Court, Judge Andrew Bright QC said: 'Your attack was brutal and relentless.' The jury heard Carbott had split up from Mr Baird’s daughter Kelly in October 2012, five months before the killing. When Carbott, who had worked as a builder for Mr Baird, moved in with Kelly he had diverted the electricity supply, so that it bypassed the meter. After he left, Mr Baird wanted him to correct the wiring. Carbott promised to meet Mr Baird on the Tuesday before he died, but rang to cancel. He was then supposed to call him on the Thursday, but did not. Prosecutor Stuart Trimmer said the defendant’s behaviour seriously annoyed Mr Baird, who spoke to friends and relatives and threatened violence to Carbott and said he would damage the home where he lived with his mother. Scene: The bungalow in Hemel Hempstead where Mr Baird was killed and set on fire . In response to voicemail messages left by Mr Baird, Carbott went to his terraced bungalow in Westerdale. There he attacked Mr Baird, who was only 5 feet 6 tall and weighed just 66 kilos, with the knife and crowbar before setting him alight. A post mortem examination revealed 17 cuts and stab wounds to the head, face and neck. There were also stab penetrations fracturing the jaw. His voice box was fractured, a wound that may have been caused by severe gripping, but is more likely to have been due to kicking or stamping while on the ground. Carbott was arrested the following day and told the police: 'What's this got to do with me? I haven't been anywhere' Pathologist Dr Nat Carey found internal bleeding in the brain and evidence of blunt impacts, including one very forceful blow to the right side, causing fracturing of the vault and base of the skull. There was burning to his head, trunk and legs. A lack of soot inhalation suggested Mr Baird was either dead or dying at the time he was set alight. Carbott was arrested at ten to five the following day and told the police: 'What’s this got to do with me? I haven’t been anywhere. 'All I have done is walk my dog. I have been at my mum’s.' He made no comment in four police interviews, but gave the officers a prepared statement through his solicitor in which he said Mr Baird had left threats to him and his mother on his voicemail. He said he did not want him threatening his mother and went to Mr Baird’s home. When he went to the door he said Mr Baird appeared with a crowbar and a knife and said: 'J - have this' and pushed the knife towards him. He said there was a struggle in which he disarmed him and caused injuries. In the statement Carbott admitted he had started the fire because he was scared. He said he had left the scene in his silver Mondeo estate and headed to a farm track on the Redbourn Road near Woodend Farm where he burned his clothes and the petrol and threw the knife and crow bar in a ditch. Carbott, of Epping Green, Hemel Hempstead, pleaded not guilty to murdering Mr Baird between Friday 1 March and Saturday 2 March last year and also denied arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered. But at the end of a trial last month the jury of eight men and four women convicted him of murder by a majority of 10 to 2. They unanimously convicted him of the arson charge. Giving evidence Carbott said Mr Baird was a 'good laugh'. Asked by his barrister Richard Carey-Hughes how they got on, he replied: 'Fine. We used to got out drinking, watch football and go to the pub. He was a good laugh. He was OK.' He said he suffered anxiety and depression after being attacked in 2007. He had also been diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. 'I had suicidal thoughts. I used to self-harm a lot. I was always planning in my head to kill myself,' he said. A post-mortem examination revealed 17 cuts and stab wounds to Mr Baird's head, face and neck. There were also stab penetrations fracturing the jaw . He said he had known Mr Baird for two years before he died and had been 'best friends' with his son Tommy Baird. But Tommy did not speak to him again after Carbott had hit him when he intervened during a row Tommy was having with his sister. After Mr Baird died and he was remanded in custody, Carbott said he had nightmares and flashbacks. 'I was waking up screaming. It was terrifying,' he said. Setting a minimum term of 27 years before Carbott can apply for parole, Judge Bright told Carbott, who appeared for sentence via a video link from Bedford jail: 'When you lose your temper, as you did that night, you are a very dangerous man.' Following the sentencing today the victim's family and the police have released statements. Thomas' daughter, Kelly, said: 'Myself and Harry would like to send thanks to all those who have been involved in Tom's case. 'I am extremely grateful for the fantastic support we have received over the last 11 months. 'Life without my Dad has felt unbearable and felt as though we are living in limbo. This void in our lives will never be filled. 'My dad was devoted to me and Harry and we have a daily struggle without him in our lives. He was the most secure and constant person in our lives. He became my rock and my best friend in my adult life and to say I feel lost and alone is an understatement. 'Harry adored his Grandad and aspired to be like him and he has been robbed of having him around to support and guide him to adulthood. 'We will never recover from this tragedy and our lives will never be the same again. We are now however reaching a point where we can begin to grieve and rebuild our lives, and we ask and thank people in advance for the privacy to do so.' Speaking about the sentence, Detective Inspector John Arthur from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, who led the investigation said: 'Thomas was the victim of a horrific and sustained attack and Carbott lied in an attempt to cover his tracks. 'Although this sentence will do nothing to bring back Thomas to his family, it does reflect the severity of Carbott's actions and I am pleased with today's sentence. 'I would like to pay tribute to Thomas's family as they have not only lost their loved one in the most brutal way, they have had to endure a trial and relive the horrific events which took place that night. 'Whilst the verdict and sentence will not bring Thomas back, I hope this sentence is of some comfort to them and that it will assist them with moving forward with their lives.'","James Carbott battered and stabbed Thomas Baird to death .

A dancer performs Sunday during the Olympics Closing Ceremony in Beijing. Fireworks across China's capital as a crowd of more than 90,000 at the landmark ""Bird's Nest"" National Stadium watched the pyrotechnics. The ceremony marked a climax to a Games that has delivered many world-breaking sporting performances and redefined the international image of the communist nation. ""Tonight, we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever,"" IOC President Jacques Rogge said. ""Through these Games, the world learned more about China, and China learned more about the world."" ""These were truly exceptional games,"" he said, declaring them formally closed.

Unlike previous Summer Olympics, logistics appeared to run smoothly for the Games. Also impressive was the emergence of a new world sporting superpower -- the host nation. China, which won its first Summer Olympic gold medal in 1984, clinched first place in the gold medal standings long before the final hours of sporting competition came to a close.

And although Chinese organizers had created designated ""protest zones,"" people allowed to protest appeared non-existent. Demonstrators at unauthorized protests were detained. On the final weekend of the Olympics, U.S. diplomatic officials raised concern to Beijing over eight Americans arrested the previous week for planning or staging protests.

The family of a Texas university student shot dead by a campus cop on Friday have said they do not believe the account given by the officer responsible for his death. Captain Chris Carter claimed he shot Robert Cameron Redus after the 23-year-old beat him with his own baton after being stopped for driving erratically. But the family of the 23-year-old, known as Cameron, say he was never aggressive or confrontational. Grief: Valerie Redus is hugged by family friend Emily Vaughan at a vigil for her son Cameron . Doubts: Mickey Redus, pictured at his son's vigil, says he has doubts about the police account of the shooting . 'Our family does not believe the . officer’s report ... For him to confront a police officer would be completely out of his character', parents Mickey and Valerie Redus said yesterday. In the statement, reported in KVUE, the family said: 'We are grieved by the tragic and unnecessary death of our son Cameron.' The Incarnate Word student was in his final year at the San Antonio university and had been celebrating the end of the fall semester with friends when he was shot outside his apartment. Friends and professors of Cameron told his parents 'just how much they admired and respected Cameron and expected him to be a success in life'. Mr and Mrs Redus added: 'We expect all official reports to confirm that Cameron’s death was unnecessary and unjustified.' The family said they knew their son would have been unarmed and added that the police had searched his apartment and cleaned up the scene before they arrived. Investigation: Police say Cameron Redus, 23, was charging at a campus police officer when he was shot . Scuffle: Witnesses heard a short exchange between Cameron and the officer before shots were fired . Police have started an investigation into the shooting but Cameron's family said they questioned the campus officer's decision to follow an unknown person to an off-campus apartment. 'Even if Cameron was driving erratically, . he presented no threat to the campus police officer or anyone else once . he parked his truck,' they said in the statement. In a press conference on Monday, Chief Richard Pruitt of the Alamo Heights Police Department said Cameron had wrestled Captain Carter's baton from him and hit the policeman in the head and arm with it. Captain Carter eventually got the baton back and told Cameron four times to stop fighting him or he would shoot. That's when the student allegedly turned around and charged at Captain Carter with his arm raised to strike, and Captain Carter fired six shots, hitting Cameron five times in the chest, neck, eye, arm and thigh. While the camera on the police cruiser . was out, audio was still working which captured Captain Carter warning the student 56 . times to stop resisting arrest, 14 times to place his hands behind his back and three times that he was under arrest, the police claimed. Alamo Heights Police Lieutenant Cindy Pruitt told KSAT . that the incident occurred about 2am in the parking lot of the Treehouse apartments in the 100 block of Grandview Place off Broadway, where . Cameron was a resident. It . is not clear where Captain Carter first tried to pull Cameron over, but both . vehicles pulled into the parking lot . of the Treehouse Apartments where the struggle ensued. Lieutenant Pruitt told My San Antonio that Captain Carter radioed for help shortly before Cameron was shot. Cameron had been celebrating the end of semester with friends before he was shot . Not aggressive: Cameron Redus' friends and family can't understand how someone as gentle and kind as him could have been shot by a police officer . A witness who lives in the Treehouse Apartments described hearing 'five or six' gunshots, but no verbal warnings. 'I . didn't hear him say anything like, ""Get down on your hands and knees,"" you know? I didn't hear him say anything. He just started shooting,' the . man told KSAT. 'He emptied the gun on him,' he said. 'Boom, boom, boom.' Mohammad Haidarasl lived directly below Cameron at the Treehouse Apartments. He told My San Antonio that he was asleep on his sofa when he heard an exchange between the student and Captain Carter. 'I heard [a man] say, ""Oh, you're gonna shoot me?"" like sarcastic almost,' he said. Less . than a minute later, Mr Haidarasl heard four to six gunshots. He only . realized the man who had been shot was his upstairs neighbor, whom Mr Haidrasl described as 'the nicest guy.' The officer, who has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the shooting investigation, has an 'extensive law enforcement background' according to the university. However, part of the background involves jumping from job-to-job on a regular basis, according to employment records obtained by the San Antonio Express-News. Devastated: One of Cameron's brothers, and his father Mickey, at the vigil . Memories: The ceremony included many remembrances from friends in the UIW community. A candlelight vigil was also held on campus at the Lourdes Grotto. Redus' brother and mother can be seen on the right of the picture . A vigil was held inside the Academic Convocation Center. Many in attendance either wore green clothing or a green ribbon as it was his favorite color. Redus' brother is seen here . 'He was just not that type of person,' Cameron's friend, 20-year-old Miriam Thomas, told My San Antonio. 'Everyone has been completely heartbroken over this.' More than 200 people - including the student's . mother and father - attended a vigil on Sunday to mourn the UIW student . and remember his short life. Captain Carter has had nine jobs at eight different agencies over his eight-year law enforcement career. He . rarely stayed in any job for more than a year and the two years and . seven months as a campus officer for UIW was the longest stint in his . career. KVUE-TV reports that Captain Carter has told investigators he feared for his life. Kyle Leihsing, a San Antonio native had been friends with Cameron for three years. 'He was one of the most level-headed people I've ever met. What I have heard is completely counter-intuitive to what I have known him to be,' he said. 'There's just an outpouring of genuine grief among hundreds, if not thousands, of people in our community because he was so well-liked and loved,' Annie Jones, another friend, told KENS 5. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the student and officer involved in this incident,' UIW President Dr Lou Agnese said. Big turnout: Family and friends of University of the Incarnate Word student Robert Cameron Redus gather for a candlelight vigil and tribute . Moving on: Cameron was due to graduate from the University of the Incarnate Word in May . Old high school friends were also shocked to hear about the shooting. 'He was so kind. He’s not an aggressive person at all,' friend Sara Davis told KHOU. 'The story doesn’t really make sense to any of us.' Cameron had moved to San Antonio from . Baytown for school. He went to Baytown Christian Academy and graduated . as co-valedictorian. His academic success continued at . UIW, where he had been named to the Dean's List and was a part-time . anchor for the school's student newscast. 'I . grieve on behalf of his parents, because I know how devastated they . are.

ffeb87a2f560f245af6bcc84b1fdd0b39dbb2aac,"(CNN) -- I carry in my mind a picture of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at the beginning of the Selma to Montgomery voting rights march on March 21, 1965. What makes that picture so vivid to me 48 years later, as we prepare to celebrate his 84th birthday this month, is that voting rights issues I once imagined were over have resurfaced on a national scale. The biggest difference between then and now is that today's voter suppression operations are highly sophisticated, compared with the crude, racist ones conducted by Southern sheriffs and voter registrars through the middle 1960s. Before the 2012 elections, well-funded efforts in state after state tried to curtail the participation of poor and minority voters by introducing burdensome voter ID requirements, despite a record showing individual voter fraud is virtually nonexistent in the United States. A five-year, nationwide investigation into voter fraud by the George W. Bush administration resulted in just 86 convictions. At the end of the Selma to Montgomery march, King delivered one of his most memorable speeches before a crowd of 25,000 on the steps of the capitol. ""Our whole campaign in Alabama has been centered on the right to vote,"" he declared. ""We are on the move now, and no wave of racism can stop us."" The beginnings of the march, which came about after violent clashes that pitted Alabama police and state troopers against civil rights protesters and black Alabamans trying to get on the voter rolls, were more uncertain. By current demonstration standards, those of us gathered at Selma, a hard town to reach for anyone who didn't live nearby, were few -- 3,200 by most estimates. As he moved to the front of the line, King seemed eager to get started. He gave no indication he was worried about his own safety. When the march moved down U.S. Highway 80, he appeared unperturbed by the counterprotest that seemed jolting to me: a ""Coonsville USA"" sign, young kids carrying BB guns screaming ""white nigger."" King had, I realized, accepted such hatred as part of his lot in life. He could not know that by August 6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act would be signed into law by President Johnson. He could only hope the Selma march changed more minds than were in the rows of us walking behind him. The voter suppression efforts that were aimed at preventing President Obama from being re-elected in 2012 are a reminder that the decisive victory the 1965 Voting Rights Act provided can be undermined if we are not vigilant. The Supreme Court already has on its calendar a case, Shelby County v. Holder, that tests the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires state and local governments, primarily in the Deep South, with a history of discrimination to obtain ""pre-clearance"" from the Justice Department before making any changes affecting voting. Motivating the Republican politicians, who in recent years have sought to suppress voting with tighter ID requirements, is their fear that the demographic tide is running against them. We have come 180 degrees from 1968, when Kevin Phillips in his landmark political study of that election, ""The Emerging Republican Majority,"" noted that by virtue of capturing the loyalty of the anti-civil rights whites of the South along with a majority of voters from the nation's heartland, Republicans put themselves in a position to be the dominant party in the country after decades of Democratic rule. In 2012 the tide has shifted again. Despite taking 59% of the white vote, Mitt Romney could not win an election in which the votes of minorities and new immigrants make up such an important share of the electorate. Republicans, aware that their hostility to such issues as future citizenship for undocumented immigrants and affirmative action has put the majority of nonwhite voters beyond their reach, have sought to do what white Southerners did before 1965 -- erect voting barriers to preserve their power. The voting barriers that King and the civil rights movement battled in the 1960s had their historic origins in such 19th century measures as the Mississippi Plan of 1890, in which the state instituted the poll tax as well as the requirement that a voter be able to read or interpret any section of the new Mississippi State Constitution. The emphasis on photo IDs, which so many poor and minority voters lack because they do not own a car and cannot afford to fly, is a variation of this past Southern strategy, as Georgia's Democratic Rep. John Lewis, who was badly beaten at Selma during the ""Bloody Sunday"" protest of March 7, has pointed out. The rhetoric of the Old South and the present can even sound alike when it comes to voter registration. We need only compare Judge R. H. Thompson bragging about how the Mississippi State Constitution of 1890 preserved the white vote ""by Anglo-Saxon ingenuity"" and Pennsylvania GOP House majority leader Mike Turzai telling a Republican State Convention this June, ""Voter ID, which is going to allow Gov. Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania, done."" (That Pennsylvania law ran into trouble with a judge and voter IDs were not required in the November election.) It is easy to imagine King being dismayed by these historical regressive links, but it is hard to imagine him being moved to silence or inaction by them. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","Nicolaus Mills remembers MLK's march from Selma to Montgomery for voting rights .

Researchers in Ohio have found a revolutionary way to let amputees feel what they're touching with prosthetic hands. The team from Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Case Western Reserve University has created a means of letting users feel more sensations, better, and with more sustained results than ever before. While others have hade lukewarm success at connecting nerves with electrodes, this team's special technique has created remarkable results. Scroll down for video... Common problem: Test subject Igor Spetic demonstrates his inability to pluck the stem from a cherry without crushing it when the sensors in his hand are turned off . Messy issue: Without sensation, Spetic is unable to determine the softness or size of an object . The breakthrough can be mostly attributed to a tiny, 7 millimeter connection called a cuff electrode. Placed in a user's body and connected to nerve bundles through the arm stump, the electrodes convey sensations from sensors on a prosthetic hand or fingers. The sense of touch is felt from 20 different spots on the hand, another feat on the part of its developers. What's more, the results have been found to last past 18 months whereas other such trials have ended with degraded sensation in the nerves. 'It’s real exciting to see what they . are doing, and I hope it can help other people,' Spetic says. “I know . that science takes a long time. If I don’t get something to take home, . but the next person does, it’s all to the better.” Neuroscience . professor at Northwester University Lee Miller told MIT Technology . Review just how exciting these results really are. Revolutionary: With the sensation on, Spetic is able to actually feel the cherry and control his grip accordingly . New technique: The remarkable results are thanks to a new technique of connecting electrodes to bundles of nerves in the arm . 'This is the greatest number of distinct touch sensations generated by peripheral nerve stimulation that I know of, and the 18-month-long stability is also unsurpassed,' Miller said. Two people have thus far been fitted with the device, including Madison, Ohio man Igor Spetic. Spetic is the subject of videos made by the researchers that first show him attempting to take the stem from a cherry while the sensation is turned off in his hand. As would often be the case for many prostetic hand users, he's unsable to complete the take without crushing the cherry. With the hand turned on, it's a different story. Spetic is able to remove the stem, leaving the cherry intact. 'It’s real exciting to see what they are doing, and I hope it can help other people,' Spetic said.

If I don’t get something to take home, but the next person does, it’s all to the better.'",Researchers at the Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Case Western Reserve University have created a new way to connect prosthetic hands to human nerves .

Low numbers: Dr Ion Jinga, Romania's ambassador in Britain, says only two dozen of his countrymen have entered the UK since January 1 . Fewer than 25 Romanians have entered Britain since labour market restrictions were relaxed on January 1, according to the country's ambassador in London. Dr Ion Jinga claims the predicted rush of his countrymen to the UK after EU border controls were relaxed has not happened. The diplomat also says that ten companies have contacted his London embassy trying to get Romanians to work for them, and they have been forced to direct them to the Jobcentre. British border officials have not published figures showing how many Romanians and Bulgarians have entered the country since New Year's Day. But in Holland they say that 21 from Romania and 15 from Bulgaria have arrived in the past two weeks, and Mr Jinga says it will be similar for the UK. 'I do not see any reason why Holland would be less attractive than the . UK, with the geographic proximity playing in favour of the Dutch. What . we know is that on the flight into Luton airport on Jan 1, only two . Romanians took advantage of the lifting of border restrictions in . Britain,' he told the Daily Telegraph. Mr Jinga said that companies who have contacted them were urged by Romanian officials to advertise in the Jobcentre, not directly through them. 'British companies are currently advertising 5,000 posts for Romanians to plug gaps in the highly skilled jobs market,' he said. Romania is trying its hardest to stop a surge of its nationals leaving the country for the rest of the EU to keep its own economy stable. But the promise of higher wages elsewhere is difficult to resist now controls on movement were lifted. Victor Spirescu, 30, was treated to Costa Coffee by Labour MP Keith Vaz when he landed in England on New Year's Day after labour market restrictions were relaxed.

Mr Clarke, who sits in the Cabinet as the prime minister’s trade envoy, said: ‘I just don’t think it’s true that the European Union is responsible for unacceptable waves of migration. The idea that you can have some fundamental debate that somehow stops all these foreigners coming here is rather typical right-wing, nationalist escapism.’ It caused a clash with Foreign Secretary William Hague, who insisted the lifting of controls on incomers from eastern European countries who joined the EU had triggered ‘large-scale migration’ and had been a ‘mistake’. But Laszlo Andor, the EU’s social affairs commissioner, suggested Britons were ‘emotional and misguided’ over the issue and would ‘pay more attention to the facts’ in the absence of a big influx from Bulgaria and Romania.","Dr Ion Jinga says influx of migrants since January 1 never happened .

But there was no escaping the murky past of Mark Duggan – the suspected gangster whose death sparked nationwide riots after he was shot by police – as mourners packed a church for his funeral yesterday. In tributes made by relatives before the 1,000-strong congregation he was described as a man who turned his life around with the help of his beloved partner; who loved playing computer games with their three children; who enjoyed getting ‘dressed up to the nines in bling’ to go out partying. Final send-off: The cortege arrives for the Mark Duggan's funeral yesterday. Duggan's brothers, the priest and the undertaker lead the flower-bedecked hearse pulled by plumed horses . A salute to a 'soldier': Mourners lined the streets and raised their palms to say farewell to the father-of-four . Procession: People paid tribute to the man described as a 'fallen soldier' The funeral was held this afternoon for Mark Duggan who was shot dead by police last month. It was his death which sparked riots across England . He was a ‘big kid himself’, said a . cousin. What’s more, she claimed, he was a ‘peacemaker’ who resolved . conflicts in the community. And he had recently applied to become a . fireman. But another side to Mark Duggan’s . life was evident too. It was there in the one-armed salute that men and . women gave as the white, horse-drawn hearse passed along the streets . from Duggan’s family home in Tottenham. And it was there outside New . Testament Church of God in Wood Green, North London, where the service . was held, as friends spoke on the street of Duggan as ‘one of our fallen . soldiers’. Outside the church, where those . mourners who could not fit inside stood on the pavement, the air was . thick with the smell of cannabis. Dark glasses were the order of the day . for men, short skirts for women. For Duggan, 29, was also known as . ‘Starrish Mark’. He was an ‘elder’, or senior member, of The Star Gang, . who strut the streets of Tottenham where such gangs trade in violence, . intimidation and drugs. Yesterday, among the floral tributes spelling out ‘dad’ and ‘son’, there was also a star-shaped wreath. During the 90-minute service Duggan’s . cousin Donna Martin began an obituary by repeating his nickname . ‘Starrish’ three times, eliciting applause from the congregation. She told of his upbringing on the . notorious Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham and how he left aged 13 to . live in Manchester with an aunt. There was no mention of the fact that . Duggan was the nephew of notorious crime boss the late Desmond ‘Dessie’ Noonan who boasted his gang had ‘more guns than the police’ and whose . feared family are ‘major players’ in Manchester’s underworld. But she did tell how Duggan had lost . friends in Manchester in ‘unfortunate circumstances’ and how, after he . moved back to London, he treated his friend Kelvin ‘Smegz’ Easton ‘like a . little brother’. The horse drawn carriage carrying the coffin leads a procession of vehicles to the New Testament Church of God, in Wood Green, north London . Distraught: Friends and family hug before the funeral held at the New Testament Church of God in Wood Green, North London today . Easton, 23, another gang member, was . stabbed through the heart with a broken champagne bottle at a nightclub . in East London last March in a row over drugs and a woman. Duggan is . said to have carried a gun afterwards for his own protection. Another source has said he was . planning to avenge the death, which is believed to be one of the reasons . that officers from Operation Trident, which investigates gun crime . within London’s black community, had Duggan under surveillance and were . trailing him in unmarked cars. He was a passenger in a minicab which . was apparently stopped by police near Tottenham Hale Tube station on . the night of August 4 when he was shot. The Independent Police Complaints . Commission, which is investigating the shooting, said police fired two . shots. One killed Duggan, the other lodged in the radio of another . police officer. Duggan’s gun, originally thought to have been a . converted replica, had not been fired. Two days after Duggan died, the . Tottenham riots erupted after his family spent five frustrating hours . seeking a meeting and explanation from local police chiefs. The . circumstances of Duggan’s death have led to lingering tensions between . family members and detectives. Yesterday policing at the funeral was . low-key.

Back at the church, ten black . Mercedes limos brought Duggan’s loved ones to the church. One of his . three children arrived in a white-striped suit and a T-shirt emblazoned . with the words ‘Miss You Daddy’ and a picture of his father in . sunglasses. In an echo of the image, the little . boy was wearing oversized sunglasses. Along with his baby sister, he was . comforted by his mother, Mr Duggan’s girlfriend Semone Wilson, as they . watched the horse-drawn hearse pass. During Miss Martin’s obituary, we . also learned that Duggan’s favourite films included gangster movie . Scarface and – ‘secretly’, she said – Annie. She repeated the family’s . belief that he would not have pointed a gun at police by saying he was . ‘no idiot and not suicidal’. Duggan’s partner Miss Wilson, 29, paid . tribute to him as her ‘first real love’ in a message read out by her . sister Michelle Palmer-Scott. ‘We faced trials and tribulations . together. We had our ups and we had our downs but through it all, I . loved him,’ she said, adding: ‘I don’t understand why you’re gone so . soon.’ Duggan’s mother Pamela Duggan, 53, . said: ‘In many way Semone saved Mark and that’s why he loved her dearly. She loved him unconditionally like they loved their children.’ Pastor Nims Obunge made an impassioned plea for peace in the community, which he said has seen ‘too much blood’.

Duggan’s death so far, Ken Hinds, a friend who was a steward at the . funeral and is chairman of the Stop and Search Monitoring Group for . Haringey, said: ‘It doesn’t fit in with everything that’s known on the . street. ‘It’s caused significant damage.

ffecf1dad502ae57829862e3ab640f36ac4fecda,"(CNN) -- Oil companies could soon be using an innovative new technique involving nanotechnology and magnets to help clean up offshore oil spills. Oil spills from container ships or offshore platforms are a frequent hazard to marine and coastal ecosystems and an expensive one to clean up. BP expects the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 -- the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history -- to cost it $40 billion. However, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) say they have found a method of recovering oil after a spill using magnets, potentially saving companies like BP money in clean up bills. On it's own, oil is not magnetic, but MIT researchers say that when mixed with water-repellent nanoparticles that contain iron, the oil can be magnetically separated from the water. The nanoparticles can later be removed to enable the re-use of the oil. ""I had known about other scientists using magnetic fluids to separate oil but it had never worked out practically and that was something I felt I could do something about,"" says co-researcher Markus Zahn. The recovery process would be conducted out at sea after the oil spill, explains Zahn. Seawater polluted with oil would be pumped onto a boat treatment facility. Once onboard, the magnetic nanoparticles would be added and attach themselves to the oil. See also: A robot that detects oil spills . The liquid would then be filtered with the magnets to separate the oil and water, with the water returned to the sea and the oil carried back to shore to an oil refinery. ""I think in the world we are in, there are always going to be spillages which affect the wildlife and livelihoods of people and this can help tackle that,"" says Zahn. Since the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, there has been a rise in interest from oil companies and government departments in funding new techniques for reducing the environmental impact and cost of future oil spills. Until now the two main methods have been using chemical dispersants, which break up the oil, and skimming, a technique whereby the oil is pulled off the surface of the water. Although there are drawbacks to both -- chemical dispersants can have negative impacts on marine life and skimming can be hampered by bad weather -- magnetic techniques may still find it difficult to gain acceptance. Zahn admits that one oil company has already turned down the opportunity of funding the research but is confident that other companies will support the project. The use of tiny nanoparticles is seen by some as controversial. As well as being complex and difficult to use on a large-scale, there are concerns they could damage marine life, if accidentally released. See also: Robotic sailboats built to clean up oil spills . While their impact on the environment is still largely unknown, scientists such as David Andrews from the U.S.-based Environmental Working Group (EWG), say their use should be limited. Others suggest the magnetic technique would be better suited to small-scale use and that existing alternatives such as skimming are still better suited for tackling large-scale offshore oil spills. ""On a small-scale it (the magnetic technique) may be an excellent system but I don't think it will work at sea in such a challenging environment,"" says Dr Susan Shaw, founder of the Marine Environmental Research Institute. ""I think ultimately, it may be a better way of recovering oil once it is brought ashore rather than out at sea."" For Shaw, a newly developed skimmer from an Illinois company Team Elastic offers a better method for cleaning up oil spills. It can recover about 4,700 gallons per minute, so assuming the skimmer could be deployed 24 hours a day, it would take 30 days to pick up the entire 200 million gallons of oil spilled during the Gulf of Mexico disaster. ""In my opinion, the new skimmers are the most hopeful and best method for cleaning up an oil spill and protecting health and the environment. They should be part of the safety equipment required by permit for every offshore drilling rig,"" says Shaw.","MIT researchers develop new technique for recovering oil using magnets .

Scam: Richard Lowery stole £56,000 from his great grandmother - who brought him up after he was abandoned by his parents . A 'son' who robbed the great-grandmother who brought him up of her £56,000 life savings has been jailed for 18 months. Richard Lowery, 24, was abandoned by his parents at the age of four and given a roof over his head by Brenda Lowery, 91. He repaid her kindness by systematically dipping into her bank account over a seven-year period for living expenses and even to pay £575 in court fines, Sheffield Crown Court heard. His great-grandmother even wrote a letter to the court asking for leniency and hoping that her 24-year-old great-grandson would not be jailed. But Judge Michael Murphy told Lowery: 'I can understand her views because to her you must be like a son. She stepped up to the mark to care for you when you needed it and has been caring for you but there are some situations which transcend the wishes of victims. 'The courts have a duty to the public to mark the repugnance society feels at such conduct. This was a breach of a high degree of trust. It was a despicable course of conduct and it was exploitation not borne of desperation but borne out of sheer greed.' Only last week the same judge gave Jayne Godsmark, 41, an eight-month suspended jail term for stealing £6,000 from her ailing 98-year-old grandmother's life savings. Louise Gallagher, prosecuting, said Lowery, who was responsible for his great-grandmother's financial affairs, stole the cash from an account she had with the HSBC for 40 years. She loaned him her bank card and he was the only one who knew her PIN number and used it at cash machines to withdraw money directly from the account or simply wrote out cheques payable to himself. His thieving came to light after his great-grandmother took out an equity release policy on her home with insurance company Aviva and Lowery attempted to obtain £30,000 in three tranches over four months in 2011. The company called in the police and the discrepancies were discovered. Ironically, Lowery used to collect his great-grandmother's pension for her without taking any of it. When interviewed by police, Lowery said he became 'addicted' to taking the money and did not realise just how much he had stolen. Plea: Despite the theft, his great-grandmother Brenda begged the judge not to jail him, Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) heard . Lowery, of Beauchief, Sheffield admitted theft of £56,427 from December, 2005 to May, 2012. Vanessa Saxton, for Lowery, said she needed her great-grandson's help with managing her finances. He apologised for his behaviour but had not told anyone, even his own family, why he did it. 'His attitude has been one of putting his head in the sand, he is a very quiet individual,' said Miss Saxton. He had made frequent small cash withdrawals over a long period of time and was astonished when confronted with the total. 'Until now he seems to have led a perfectly respectable life and cared for his great-grandmother all his life,' said Miss Saxton. He still lived with Mrs Lowery but no longer had access to her bank account. Judge Murphy told Lowery he had used the account as a cash dispenser 'to dip into whenever you wanted.' In sentencing he had taken into account Lowery's guilty plea, his previous good character and the views of his great-grandmother which helped reduce the sentence he handed down. A proceeds of crime hearing is expected to take place later in the year to reimburse Mrs Lowery for her losses.","Richard Lowery was dumped by his parents aged 4, and great-grandmother Brenda stepped in .

PC Eileen Arthurs, 52, has been jailed for two and a half years for misconduct in a public office . A police officer has been jailed today after she accessed the police national computer database to help a friend who was once suspected of involvement in Britain's biggest ever cash robbery. PC Eileen Arthurs, 52, lied to police about her friendship with Lee May, who was described as 'a man of interest' by detectives investigating the £52million robbery of a . Securitas warehouse in Tonbridge, Kent, in 2006. Arthurs . denied five charges of misconduct in a public office between 2004 and . 2012 but was convicted today by a jury at Maidstone . Crown Court and jailed for two and a half years. Divorcee Arthurs met Mr May when she sold her £760,000 house to him and the two became ‘at least’ friends. The court heard at one stage she was even asked by senior police officers if she knew 'trustworthy' neighbours in the street who could help them with surveillance on Mr May’s house. Lee May was never arrested or charged in connection with the robbery, and is not a police suspect in the case. Arthurs was working in the community safety unit at North Kent police station in Northfleet. Last year Mr May attended the police station to report someone was trying to kill him, giving a description of the car, an Audi, and its registration number. The following day Arthurs told a colleague she had seen a black Audi and its occupants 'behaving suspiciously' on her way to work that morning. She said she had kept a note of the car’s registration number which matched the one given by Mr May the previous day. Arthurs obtained a print-out of the Audi’s details on the PNC (police national computer), including its history and registered owner. She reported to her acting sergeant that the car’s registered owner was from Yorkshire and that the vehicle was 'probably dodgy'. Senior officers had already been suspicious of her conduct and on her way home from work she was stopped by police and arrested. Arthurs, from Bexley, Kent, was found to wrongly have the PNC print-out in her possession, and she had handwritten the same details on another piece of paper. She admitted knowing Mr May and said her account of the Audi that morning was a 'complete fabrication'. Arthurs worked in the community safety unit at North Kent police station in Northfleet . Judge Martin Joy told Arthurs, pictured arriving at court, that offences by officers 'seriously undermine the trust in the police service' Investigating officers looking into . the PC’s association with Mr May found this was not the first time she . had been spoken to about using the PNC for non-policing purposes. Between 2004 and 2005 Arthurs had used the Genesis police system to check the profile of Mr May. In June 2005 she accessed information on a Michelle Stevenson listed on the database, a former partner of Mr May. And in 2006 Arthurs checked the profile of Ian Tucker. He too was 'associated' with Mr May. Arthurs was given a formal warning by the Professional Standards Department of Kent Police in 2008 to 'show a higher degree of honesty and integrity' when using the police system. But she still failed to disclose her association with Mr May when submitting a vetting form to fellow officers in November 2011. Prosecutor Matthew Jewell told the court: 'We know that PC Arthurs was aware of May’s status as a man of interest to police. 'She knew he had been linked to one of the biggest robberies, not just in Kent but in the UK. 'Investigating officers working on the Securitas robbery considered Lee May a person of interest, so much so that they wanted to set up an observation operation on his home. 'Officers discovered that PC Arthurs had connections to this address, namely she used to live in the house before May. 'An officer leading the Securitas case emailed Arthurs asking if she knew any trustworthy people in the street who they could contact in a bid to set up their surveillance operation. 'Arthurs replied saying that she did not, however she did assist in compiling a full layout of the house.' Jailing her for two and a half years, Judge Martin Joy told Arthurs: 'You told lies to other officers, including superiors, perhaps to cover your tracks for your dishonest and criminal behaviour. 'This was an extended course of misconduct carried out over many years. The misuse of the computer relates to major criminals and not mundane matters. 'It is clear that misconduct by police officers such as committed by you seriously undermine the trust in the polices service which the public are entitled to.' Arthurs joined Kent Police in June 2002 about a year after separating from her husband. The court heard she was 'at least' friends with May - having regular and general contact, although she referred to him as a 'neighbour'. Kent Assistant Chief Constable Gary Beautridge said: 'The vast majority of officers serve with the utmost integrity, honour and pride. 'It is important that those rare few who cross the line are dealt with appropriately and charged if an offence has been committed.'","PC Eileen Arthurs, 52, accessed the police national database to help friend Lee May - once suspected of involvement in the £52million Securitas robbery .

ffed780e3c61e69339fd005410cbcab4d9a57ed9,"Depending who you ask, Yahoo's decision to hire Marissa Mayer several months into her pregnancy is either a boon to all working mothers or a misstep for the ailing tech company. ""Talk about lousy timing. She'll be taking maternity leave when she needs to be at work. Yahoo has enough problems without a part-time CEO,"" one commenter said in response to the Fortune article announcing news of her pregnancy. ""It is quite possible that she can do both effectively, but it is not un-'evolved' to express concern,"" another said, referring to Mayer's comment that Yahoo's directors demonstrated ""evolved thinking"" in choosing to hire a pregnant chief executive. ""As a Yahoo shareholder, I am very concerned and have every reason to be."" It's possible that Mayer anticipated these reactions when she revealed her plan to work during her maternity leave so she could ""stay in the rhythm of things."" Her announcement reignited an already hot debate over whether women can ""have it all"" and how family leave policies make it hard to juggle a successful career and family. Opinion: What signal is Marissa Mayer giving to Yahoo employees? But Mayer isn't your typical working mother, and some believe her experience reflects the extreme demands that corporate America places on men and women alike and how that translates to national policy. Besides, the demands of motherhood only grow with time, author and activist Gloria Feldt said. That's when benefits such as flexible scheduling, reduced work weeks and the option to work from home really make a difference in helping women get as close as possible to having it all. iReport: How do you balance career and family? ""Life only gets busier as your children grow, and that's where flexible benefits comes in,"" she said. ""We have a long way to go as a country when it comes to making those benefits accessible to everyone."" iReporter Jennifer Compton was away from work for 12 weeks after the birth of her son, Jack. But that hasn't made returning any easier, she said. Having flexible hours and remote cameras in day cares would help ease the transition, she said. ""Before, I got to spend all day with my son, and now it's only two or three hours in the evening,"" the human resources manager said in an iReport submitted to CNN.com. ""I want more time with my little guy, but I have to take what I can get. ... It's hard to balance everything."" 'Superhuman, rich or self-employed' That Mayer's pregnancy is a matter of concern to some even though it wasn't for Yahoo's board (as Mayer tells it) reflects a double-standard, Feldt said. ""It's very common for companies to negotiate time off upfront with a new hire. If she were a man, no one would judge her for taking time off, regardless of the reason,"" said Feldt, author of ""No Excuses: 9 Ways Women Can Change How We Think About Power."" Nearly 61% of women with children younger than 3 and 56% of women with children younger than 1 were in the labor force in 2011, according to Catalyst, an organization that tracks women's advancement in the workplace, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics. But ambivalence over their participation in the work force seems to persist. A 2009 Pew Research Center report found that 21% of adults said the trend toward more mothers working outside the home had been good for society; 37% said it had been bad and 38% said it hasn't made much difference. Women reported feeling stressed about balancing work and family, the report said, with 40% of working moms saying they always feel rushed compared with 24% of the general public and 26% of stay-at-home moms. As for working dads, 25% said they always feel rushed. This month's Atlantic magazine cover story, ""Why Women Still Can't Have It All,"" has stoked intense debate on the topic. Former State Department official Anne-Marie Slaughter proposes that the only women who manage to reach the pinnacle of their careers while raising a family are ""superhuman, rich or self-employed."" Slaughter chronicles her decision to leave Washington and return to academia so she can play a larger role in raising her sons, using her personal journey as a jumping off point to examine the decisions and barriers women face in balancing a career with family. In Twitter exchanges this week punctuated with the hashtag #havingitall, the Princeton University professor applauded Mayer's appointment at Yahoo but noted that it seemed to prove her thesis. ""Women who are having it all are superhuman, rich, and in charge. I'm all for Marissa Mayer! but the norm?"" she tweeted. Her exchange with Mia Farrow, who tweeted ""let's hope she inspires [corporations] to create better options for all working moms,"" underscored what feminists and policy experts have been saying for years: that corporate culture in the United States, one of few industrialized nations without paid family leave for new parents, does not foster ideal conditions for work-life balance -- for women or men. ""We live in a society where there's very little space for men or women in corporate spheres to easily juggle family lives with professional lives,"" said Caroline Heldman, chair of the Politics Department at Occidental College in California. ""When we talk about maternity leave, we assume it's only women who should be taking time off when a child is born. I think that comes from a culture where the assumption is that women are the primary caretakers and the father's bond with his children is not as important,"" Heldman said. ""I think we would have better familial bonds if we viewed parenting as something that every parent could participate in, not just women."" Someone in Mayer's position likely has the resources to enable her to work through maternity leave, but that's certainly not the norm for most working mothers. If anything, her experience is representative of the rules and expectations of CEOs of major corporations, 97% of whom are male, Heldman said. ""Her choices don't necessarily work for women in lower ranks and should not be held up as a standard for what all men or women should or could do,"" Heldman said. ""She's playing by the good old boys' rules, which uphold a system that doesn't allow space and time for male or female CEOs to really take time off if they need it."" Facing tough choices . Some parents can take time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which guarantees eligible employees at companies with more than 50 employees 12 weeks of unpaid, job-guaranteed leave for the birth or adoption of a child, according to Catalyst. Similar statutes exist in Washington D.C., California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin. In 2002, California became the first state to enact a paid family leave act, allowing employees to take six weeks' leave and up to 55% of their weekly wages, with a benefit cap, to care for a newborn or newly adopted child. Every employee who contributes to the State Disability Insurance is covered, not just those who work for companies with 50 employees or more. Although some individual companies offer a paid maternity leave benefit, many parents end up using a combination of short-term disability, sick leave, vacation, personal days and unpaid family leave. Most working mothers return to work within a year of having a child, according to the 2009 report, ""Opting-Out: An Exploration of Labor Force Participation of New Mothers,"" based on the American Community Survey three-year data file for 2005-2007. The researchers hypothesized that two groups of women may opt out: women whose earnings are so low they may not be able to afford child care and women whose family earnings allow them to forgo personal earnings. A 2004 Catalyst study found that while senior-level women and men showed interest in informal and formal flexible work arrangements, few actually took advantage of them: 44% of women used flexible arrival and departure times, compared with 36% of men; and 13% of women telecommuted or worked from home, compared with 12% of men. Perhaps the most telling is that 91% of women and 94% of men agreed that they could be flexible with their schedules when they had a family emergency or personal matter, but only 15% of women and 20% of men said that they could use a flexible work arrangement without jeopardizing career advancement. In the absence of policies that help working mothers, some end up leaving the work force or creating their own solutions. iReporter Shadra Smith of Fort Wayne, Indiana, took a pay cut when she changed jobs after finding out she was pregnant. ""[I] took a position that unfortunately pays less, but it allows me to have the mental and physical strength for my son,"" Smith said in an iReport. ""I've already accomplished some career goals, and being a mother is the career I would love to concentrate on now."" she said.

A trainee nurse has been awarded over £75,000 compensation after a prick on her finger at work transformed her into a cleaning obsessive. Alcinda Tobbal could not kiss or make love to her husband for fear of 'contamination' after being jabbed with a dirty needle whilst working as a nurse assistant at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London. The 45-year-old developed a 'severe' obsessive compulsive disorder focused on cleanliness after the incident in February 2008, a court heard. Alcinda Tobbal, pictured, developed a 'severe' obsessive compulsive disorder focused on cleanliness, after being accidentally jabbed with a dirty needle whilst working at Whipps Cross Hospital, east London . She was dismissed from her job due to the effects of the extreme OCD condition, which saw her wearing gloves even in baking hot weather and scrubbing her children’s shoes with bleach whenever they had been outside. But the most damaging aspect of her condition was that she became incapable of having intimate relations with, or even kissing, her bus driver husband, leading to the disintegration of their marriage, after he dubbed her 'mental'. Now she has been awarded damages by a judge, including more than £20,000 for her ‘pain and suffering’, which takes into account the fact that her marriage broke down due to her condition. Judge Edward Bailey, sitting at Central London County Court, said that the mother-of-five was employed as a nursing assistant and was working towards becoming a fully qualified nurse by studying at night school. But her career was destroyed when she was accidentally stabbed in the finger by a dirty needle sticking out of an 'over full' sharps bin in an operating theatre. Despite being given the all-clear after blood tests to rule out hepatitis and HIV infection, Mrs Tobbal’s distress and anxiety about what had happened to her continued to increase, with her 'main anxieties revolving around her HIV status', the judge said. Her symptoms snowballed until 'a diagnosis of OCD at the severe end of the scale...making it impossible for her to return to work and having a significant impact on her life, most seriously on the breakdown of her marriage,' the judge added. Alcinda Tobbal was working as a trainee nurse at Whipps Cross Hospital, pictured, in east London when the accident happened . Whipps Cross NHS Trust admitted primary liability for the accident and its alarming consequences for Mrs Tobbal, but hotly disputed the extent of Mrs Tobbal’s difficulties and the amount of compensation she deserved. Judge Bailey ruled that Mrs Tobbal ought to be compensated for her inability to work for the past five years. He told the court: 'I am quite satisfied that her continued absence from work after her accident was as a result of the injury she received and her - albeit excessive - psychological reaction to it.' He added that Mrs Tobbal 'developed a habit of compulsive cleaning' after the injury despite having blood tests for hepatitis B and C and HIV which came back negative two weeks after the accident. 'The average person, armed with normal fortitude, would have been able to get on with his or her life, no doubt making a firm mental note to be more careful of the sharps bin. Alcinda Tobbal became incapable of having intimate relations with, or even kissing, her bus driver husband, leading to the disintegration of their marriage, the court heard . 'Unfortunately, Mrs Tobbal was unable to get on in this way. She suffered from what can only be described as an eggshell psychology,' he added. Describing her condition, the judge went on: 'She feels the need to clean and re-clean crockery, cutlery and her house generally. 'She began to wear gloves in everyday activities because she was concerned she might contaminate her family. 'She felt unable to go out, avoiding leaving the home and endeavouring for some time to prevent her children from going out, except for school. 'When they returned from school, she washed their outside school clothing every day and ensured their shoes were scrubbed with bleach. 'She felt unable to have any physical intimacy with her husband for fear she would contaminate him. This led, after an initial period of support, to the breakup of their relationship. 'Even a kiss left her in fear of contamination and resulted in her need to wash. 'Of course, there is more to marriage than physical intimacy - Mrs Tobbal describes a good working friendly relationship with her husband whilst they brought up their children. 'But their emotional as well as their physical relationship has now broken down. 'While there was initial support from her husband, he now describes her as mental.' Judge Bailey awarded her damages for five years of pain, suffering and loss of earnings, including more than £20,000 'for the disruption to her work, her life and her marriage', caused by her 'fear of contamination.' However he declined to give her an award for future losses, saying Mrs Tobbal now has hopes for a brighter future, after her five years of hell. The judge said that recent psychology reports had concluded that 'her prognosis for a return to her pre-accident state was good' if she undertook appropriate counseling. Tara Vindis, for Mrs Tobbal, said of her client: 'She only has one friend as a result of her OCD. 'Her boundaries have shrunk and she lives a very insular life, focused on keeping her house very, very clean.' Mrs Tobbal declined to comment after the hearing.","Alcinda Tobbal became cleaning obsessive after pricking finger at work .

Karim Benzema put the hosts ahead in the sixth minute, slotting home after Alvaro Morata had crossed from the left before Barca equalized 12 minutes later -- Lionel Messi collecting his 18th goal against Real Madrid and his 50th of the season. Cristiano Ronaldo came on as a sub in the second half and livened up proceedings, but it was Sergio Ramos who scored the winner eight minutes from the end, rising highest to head home Luka Modric's corner. Barcelona thought they should have been awarded a penalty in the final minute when, at the other end, Ramos appeared to trip Adriano but the referee didn't agree. An angry protest by Victor Valdes after the final whistle earned the goalkeeper a red card. The result takes Real to 55 points and within one point of second-place city rivals Atletico -- who travel to Malaga on Sunday. Despite the loss -- just their second in the league this season -- Barca are still way out ahead of on 68 points, but not in an unassailable position just yet, as the match winner Ramos pointed out. ""In the league 13 points is better than 16. We have reduced the distance and whilst it is still possible mathematically we are obliged to fight,"" Ramos said. But thoughts are already turning to Tuesday's last 16 Champions League match up against Manchester United at Old Trafford. Defender Pepe believes back-to-back wins over Barcelona can inspire Real to victory in the second leg with the tie evenly poised at 1-1. Blog: Pedro's Point of View . ""We are very happy with the victory and it was important to win. It gives us a lot of hope for the game on Tuesday, we have to go out and try to win the game in Manchester,"" Pepe said.

Police . confirmed a shotgun registered to him was recovered from the house at . Pow Green, a hamlet outside Ledbury in Herefordshire. Officers are . investigating whether the deaths were the result of a murder-suicide or a . suicide pact, but said nobody else was involved. The . couple were described as pillars of the community, who moved to the . area from Worcestershire following Mr Knott’s retirement in 2006. Mr . Knott, a former church warden,  was said to be under ‘a lot of stress’ while fighting a planning application for the travellers’ camp in a . field next  to their house. Six . weeks ago, he wrote a letter,  published on Herefordshire County . Council’s website, objecting to plans to convert the field into a . one-family  site featuring a toilet block and  septic tank. Police were called to the home, pictured, of John and Elizabeth Knott near Bosbury after worried relatives could not get in contact with the couple . Mr Knott, feared that his property, pictured, would be impacted by any adjacent development after a family sought to change a field to the right of the property from agricultural to traveller accomodation . Mr Knott, whose house, marked 1 bounded the site, marked 2, objected to the planned traveller's site marked 3 . In . it, he said: ‘There are at least eight settled (traveller) families . within a one-mile radius of the proposed site. The area cannot sustain . any more.’ He also . expressed concerns that his home and neighbouring properties could be . flooded by sewage from the septic tank if the plans for the camp were . approved. The proposed site would have been the second set up near the Knotts’ house in two years. In 2012, the council approved plans for a traveller camp on the other side of their property, separated from them by woodland. Two caravans and a day room were installed on the Oakfield Nash End Lane site. Last . night, a former colleague of Mr Knott’s at Birmingham-based Ashford . Construction said: ‘They faced being virtually surrounded by traveller . sites. It drove him  to despair.’ Lyn . Hodgkiss, who runs a  butcher’s shop in a nearby village where Mr Knott . was a regular customer, said: ‘His wife had Alzheimer’s. He was . fighting the travellers near his house and it must have got too much for . him. Mr Knott had written to Herefordshire Council to express his concern about this planned change of useage from Agriculture to a one-family traveller site . ‘He always used to . come in and give us a nice order and he used to come in all happy and . ask how our son is. I could only say good things about him.’ A neighbour added that the couple were ‘very chatty and friendly’ when they moved to the area. He added: ‘Mr Knott had worked in the building trade but his wife was pretty poorly. ‘Apparently she was fading. He was very concerned about having a camp next door at the same time as caring for his wife. 'The . last time I saw him, he said he was under a lot of stress. He said he . was worried about the possible impact the traveller camp would have on . them because they have to drive past their house to get there.’ Mr Knott, whose property is circled, claimed the planned development, outlined in red, also presented a danger to traffic in the area due to the narrow road . Mr Knott said in his planning objection that he feared that developing a site so close to his home could put his 300-year-old cottage at risk of flooding . Mr Knott, feared the site to the south, marked in red would lead to flooding of his home, circled centre. He told planners that there was already traveller accommodation in the area, circled top centre . The couple’s local vicar, the Reverend Nicky Seabright, said yesterday: ‘The community are deeply shocked. ‘We do know that Mrs Knott was suffering from a progressive illness which must have been challenging for them both.’ Mrs Knott, who was known by her middle name Anne, had a 48-year-old daughter called Jane from a previous marriage. There was no answer at her home in Worcester yesterday. Other relatives declined to comment. Mr Knott, who was a former managing director of a construction firm, also expressed concern about the hand-drawn map attached to the planning application . Mr Knott's cottage is located on the northern boundary of the area marked in blue on this document . A . West Mercia Police spokesman said that officers were called to the . house at around 10.30am on Monday after family members were unable to . contact the couple. He added: ‘We would like to speak to anyone who saw Anne and John Knott prior to Monday August 11. ‘At . present, the last confirmed sighting was around midday on Saturday . August 9 and if anybody has had contact with them in recent days, we . urge them to come forward.’ Post-mortem examinations found they each . died of a single shotgun wound.

The war over chicken sandwiches escalated today as gay rights advocates revealed plans for a 'Same Sex Kiss Day' at Chick-fil-A to counter the hundreds of thousands of people who lined drive-through lanes and filled dining rooms at the restaurants across the nation on Wednesday. The fast food chain said it enjoyed record-setting sales thanks to 'Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day,' which seemed to achieve its goal of backing the company's 'Christian principles' by asking supporters to vote with their feet and their dollars. Liberal groups are furious at the fast food chain after CEO Dan Cathy was quoted as saying he supports the 'biblical definition of marriage' and that the United States was 'inviting God's judgement' by supporting gay marriage. Conservatives, including top politicians and pundits like former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Fox News commentator Mike Huckabee, have rallied to the defense of the company -- citing concerns over freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Scroll down for video . In your face: Gay rights groups are hoping to combat yesterday's Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day with a same-sex kissing protest at stores across the country . Supporters: This scene, people standing in long lines to patronize a Chick-fil-A in Fresno, California, was played out at the chain's restaurants across the nation . Waiting: The drive-through lane in Huntsville, Alabama, circles the parking lot twice hundreds of people waited for their turn at a chicken sandwhich . Huckabee's Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day was a wildly successful national movement -- with nearly 700,000 people pledging to attend on Facebook. Photos emerged from across the nation -- from Texas to Colorado to California and Chicago -- of patrons waiting for hours to support the company. 'It's gone beyond anything I could have imagined,' Huckabee, a former Republican presidential candidate, told Fox News. 'Every one of (the stores) that I know have reported record, historic sales yesterday... A lot of the stores ran out of chicken before the end of the day.' Chick-fil-A says it had nothing to do . with planning the rally that brought customers to its stores in droves, . but it appreciated the business. Should Chick-fil-A be free to voice their support for the biblical definition of marriage? 'We are very grateful and humbled by . the incredible turnout of loyal Chick-fil-A customers on August 1 at . Chick-fil-A restaurants around the country,' the company said in a . statement. It added: 'While we don't release exact sales numbers, we can confirm reports that it was a record-setting day.' Gay rights groups like the Gay and . Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation are firing back on Friday by . encouraging gay couples to 'show Chick-fil-A thanks for their support of . Love, Equality, and the Real Definition of Marriage!' by smooching at . the restaurant and photographing the evidence. Organizers don't recommend eating at Chick-fil-A and are encouraging their supporters to visit Kentucky Fried Chicken. Mockery: The Facebook group for the National Same Sex Kissing Day plays off the Chick-fil-A slogan 'eat mor chikin' with the motto 'kiss mor chicks' Show of faith: A pair of nuns were photographed walking out of a Chick-fil-A on Wednesday loaded with food, milkshakes and iced tea . Competition: A Wendy's franchise owner in North Carolina had several of his stores post support for Chick-fil-A on their marquee signs . A 20-year-old gay man and self-described liberal supporter of President Barack Obama, made a surprising announcement when he revealed he would continue eating at Chick-fil-A. The man, who gave his name only as Matt, wrote in a column for CNN iReport that 'Cathy has been unfairly attacked for his statement that he doesn't support same-sex marriage.' He argues that Cathy has a right to his opinion and  he respects Chick-fil-A for closing on Sundays out of principle. Matt writes that when gay rights activist 'push on anti-gay people and organizations to change their minds and opinions via bullying or forced involvement,' the results will not be favorable. 'I'm a gay man. I love Chick-fil-A as a place to get good tasting food. I . do not support their beliefs and disagree with their funding of groups . that are well known to be anti-gay activists. Personally they have never . treated me any different as a gay man and I will continue to do . business with them so long as that holds true,' he writes. Despite . their efforts, the protest is unlikely to come close to matching the . impact of Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day -- only 11,000 Facebook users . have said they plan to attend 'National Same Sex Kiss Day.' Not all gay people support the boycott, though. A 20-year-old gay man, who said he is a liberal who supports President Barack Obama, wrote a piece for CNN iReport in which he defended Cathy's right to oppose gay marriage. The man said he planned to continue eating at Chick-fil-A because he thinks the reaction of gay rights groups has been overblown -- and their southern-style chicken sandwiches taste good, too. As opponents regroup, Chick-fil-A is finding even more supporters -- including the owner of competing fast food restaurants. Jim Furman, the biggest Wendy's franchise owner in the world, posted 'We stand with Chick-fil-A' on the signs outside several of his restaurants in North and South Carolina, reported WBTV in Charlotte. The Wendy's corporate office issued a statement distancing the company from Mr Furman, saying 'we are proud to serve customers of varied races, backgrounds, cultures and sexual orientation, with different beliefs and values.' Mr Furman took the signs down after speaking with Wendy's officials. Roman Catholic Cardinal Francis George, the leader of the Archdiocese of Chicago, also sided with Chick-fil-A when he criticized Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel for blasting the company's anti-gay marriage stance. The mayor said the chain's values 'are . not Chicago's values' and said he did not welcome plans to . build additional restaurants in Chicago. Face off: When Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said that Chick-fil-A's values 'are not Chicago's values,' Cardinal Francis George said the mayor's view doesn't represent the Catholics who support 'traditional marriage' Controversy: CEO Dan Cathy drew ire from gay rights groups with his comments about same sex marriage . That opinion was shared and repeated by the mayors of San Francisco and Boston, as well. Emanuel's . words, along with a vow by Alderman Proco 'Joe' Moreno to block any . expansion in the city, drew Cardinal George's ire. 'I . was born and raised here, and my understanding of being a Chicagoan . never included submitting my value system to the government for . approval. Must those whose personal values do not conform to those of . the government of the day move from the city?' he wrote on the Chicago . Archdiocese blog on Sunday. A . church spokeswoman said the cardinal was standing up for 'religious . freedom' and that he has long spoken out against same-sex marriage. Cathy, the son of the company's founder, was quoted in a Baptist newspaper on July 16 saying he was 'guilty as charged' when asked about his opposition to gay marriage. He later told a Christian radio show: 'I think we are inviting God's judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at Him and say, ""We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage,"" and I pray God's mercy on our generation that has such a prideful, arrogant attitude to think that we have the audacity to try to redefine what marriage is about.' Cathy says Chick-fil-A isn't a Christian . company -- however its stores are all closed on Sunday, even in . airports and shopping malls, and his company biography says the purpose of his business is to 'glorify God by being a faithful steward of all . that is entrusted to us.' Opposition: Gay rights supporter Trey King stood outside the Chick-fil-A in Hollywood, California, on Wednesday with a rainbow flag to protest the chain's opposition to gay marriage . Picketing: The massive crowds drew handfuls of gay rights protestors to Chick-fil-A on Wednesday . Chick-fil-A also puts its money where its mouth is, donating $5 million to Christian groups between 2003 and 2010. The company supported groups like the Family Research Council, which lobbies Congress on a host of conservative social issues -- including the prohibition of gay marriage. Chick-fil-A, a $4.5 billion company, has made the Cathy family very wealthy. Dan Cathy, who runs operations, owns one-third of the family business -- making him a billionaire.

ffeeae175e5f04a713bcb69acde3c6120e555565,"A computer student suspected of trying to hack into police websites has been jailed for refusing to hand over his password in the interests of national security. University student Christopher Wilson caused the Northumbria Police website to shut down after ringing the force using a voice changing device to warn of a cyber attack. Wilson, who has Asperger's Syndrome, was caught sending online messages about 'trolling the Newcastle police department' and infiltrating the secret files of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Christopher Wilson, 22, has been jailed for six months for refusing to hand over his computer passwords after earlier being suspected of trying to hack into police websites . The 22-year-old even suggested putting nasty messages on a condolence page set up for two female police officers shot dead in Manchester. Wilson, who is doing a Master's degree in computers and has set up his own business programming artificial intelligence systems, was studying at Northumbria University when he first came to the attention of police. After repeatedly refusing to provide his password for his encrypted computer, a judge last year ordered him to do so in the interests of national security. None of the 50 passwords he provided worked so he has now been jailed for six months for failing to provide his details. The Master's student has set up his own business programming artificial intelligence systems . Judge Simon Hickey told him: 'What you were doing was for your own satisfaction, showing what you could do with your undoubted skill with computers. 'But this is a serious offence and I can't avoid an immediate custodial sentence.' Police began investigating Wilson in October, 2012 after two emails were sent to the Vice Chancellor of Newcastle University saying a man had been making online threats to kill a member of his staff and that he had a handgun and ammunition. The message was sent under the username 'Catch 22', which was linked to Wilson's server. Police began investigating Wilson in October, 2012 while he was studying at Northumbria University, pictured above, after he emailed another university warning them about an online threat against one of their staff . Police went to Wilson's home in Milford Close, Washington, and seized computer equipment, including one system he had built himself which allowed remote access to other computers. Wilson denied making the university threats and claimed he had fallen out with a couple of Dutch men online and that the allegations were malicious. Prosecutors accepted he was telling the truth and he wasn't charged. Police still wanted to access his computer and the passwords he initially provided didn't work. Detectives later linked Wilson to a call made to them a month later warning that the Northumbria Police website was going to be attacked. The attack lasted for eight minutes and the website began to slow down before being taken down as a precaution for four minutes. Wilson was arrested in January last year and admitted making the call but claimed he was just warning them of a possible attack by someone else. Police then uncovered other messages he had sent from his Skype phone which included him saying, 'gonna (sic) go harass some police stations' and 'Let's troll Newcastle police department'. He also encouraged others to report a hoax mugging outside Newcastle's Centre for Life. Wilson also discussed hacking into the university network and getting passwords for 50 other students, the court heard. When his phone was examined, police found references to him carrying out another online attack on the Serious Organised Crime Agency and trolling a police memorial page. David Lister, defending, said: 'He has expressed genuine remorse, he bitterly regrets his actions. 'He was 19 at the time and the impact of his Autism Spectrum Disorder or Asperger's meant he matured more slowly than others.'","Christopher Wilson was ordered by a judge to hand over his password .

Accused: Ryan Wyngarden goes on trial this week for the murder of his sister and her husband . The jury in the murder trial of a Michigan man accused of killing his sister and her husband for fear that she would reveal their incestuous love affair on Tuesday heard opening statements from the prosecution and the defense, which painted two very different pictures of the double homicide. Ryan Wyngarden, a 52-year-old married father-of-four from Zeeland, stands accused of shooting dead Gail and Rick Brink in their Park Township home in November 1987, only 18 months after their wedding. The prosecution in the case opened the trial Tuesday in Grand Haven by trying to convince the jury that the killings were premeditated – and that Wyngarden had admitted to his wife that he murdered the couple. Ottawa County Assistant Prosecutor Lee Fisher said in court that Mr Wyngarden was jealous of the relationship between his sister and her newlywed husband, and that the defendant was concerned that Gail Brink might reveal the truth about their sexual relationship. Wyngarden's defense team insisted that the 52-year-old man was innocent and had an alibi for the time of the murder, MLive.com. Defense attorney David Hall laid out a theory where a motorcycle gang with connections to a drug ring may have been behind the slayings. Day 1: Ryan Wyngarden appears in an an Ottawa County courtroom monitor during the opening his murder trial in Grand Haven, Michigan . The defense also insisted that no incest had occurred between the siblings during their teenage years. The case of Rick and Gail Brink laid unsolved until investigators decided to re-open it in 2011 and re-interview Wyngarden and his wife. At first, Pam Wyngarden stuck to the . story she had repeated for decades: that she and her husband were . visiting a friend's house, where they were babysitting the children, at . the time of the killings. But during interviews in January 2013, . the mother-of-four changed her story, saying that she could no longer hide his secret and claiming that her husband had . admitted to shooting dead the Brinks. At . a hearing in February 2013, she said they had only been dating a few . months when Ryan Wyngarden told her he had killed the couple because he . feared his sister would reveal they had had a sexual relationship as . teenagers. 'I was concerned that I would go to jail... because I was holding this information for so long,' she said, Michigan Live reported. 'I told myself I can't have this burden on my shoulders. I can't live with this.' Killed: Rick and Gail Brink were shot dead in their home in November 1987, 18 months after they married . Victims: Wyngarden allegedly shot the couple because he was worried she would reveal they had sex as teens . At a hearing last year, she recounted the moment Wyngarden allegedly told her he had carried out the murders in November 1987, just three months after they first started dating. 'He was upset and crying,' she told the court. 'And I asked, ""What's wrong?"" and he said, ""I shot and killed Rick and Gail"". I asked if he had called the police, and he said no.' When she asked him why he had killed them, 'he said the reason he shot them was he didn't want Rick to find out the intimate relationship between him and Gail and that he was jealous', she said. Mrs Wyngarden explained that this intimate relationship had been a sexual one. She said she married him regardless of . his confession because she craved love and support for her and her two . children, one of whom was his. According to the prosecution, Mrs Wyngarden told detectives that her husband brought her to his late sister's home and showed her where Gail and her husband were killed. Afterwards, the 52-year-old man allegedly warned her: 'If you ever tell anyone about this, the same thing is going to happen to you.' Wyngarden sits behind a photo of murder victims Gail and Rick Brink shown on an Ottawa County courtroom monitor . Prosecutor Doug Mesman shows photos of the Brink family during questioning of witness Bud Brink during the murder trial of Ryan Wyngarden . Pam Wyngarden is expected to take the stand and testify against her husband as the star witness for the prosecution. Fisher told the jurors Tuesday that the married woman will talk about how her husband allegedly left angry voicemails for investigators after they questioned the couple in October 2012. Mr Hall, who represents Wyngarden, said in court that his client stills stands by his alibi. In his opening statement, the defense attorney raised the possibility that the Brinks couple may have been victims in a case of mistaken identity. According to Hall, the previous owners of Gail and Rick's Park Township home, who had moved out not long before the murders, had been linked to narcotics trade and had connections to a Detroit-area biker gang. The previous homeowner, who was said to be a one-time police informant, is expected to testify during the trial as a witness for the defense. The trial is expected to last two weeks. Wyngarden remains in the Ottawa County Jail. Revelations: Pam Wyngarden, pictured in court last year after the case was re-opened, told investigators that her husband had admitted to killing the couple and she agreed to help him cover it up . Denial: Wyngarden sobbed throughout the hearing in February 2013 and yelled that he was not guilty . In the years after Wyngarden allegedly . told his wife about the murder, he demanded she kept it a secret and . would not allow her to have any friends in fear that she would tell . them, she said. As she spoke in court last year, her husband sobbed and shouted: 'How can you say these things? I didn't kill them, I didn't!' But Crystal Beelen, a former girlfriend of . Wyngarden's, also testified that Wyngarden admitted that . he had had a sexual relationship with his sister when they were . teenagers. The bodies of Rick, 28, and Gail Brink, 22, were found by Rick's parents, Isla and Bud Brink, after he failed to show up for work. The couple had last been seen two days before at a wedding. In the hearing last year, Mrs Brink said she found her daughter-in-law on the bed with a pillow over her head and multiple gun wounds. Her son was also found shot dead in his truck outside the home. Happier times: Pam Wyngarden, pictured, said her husband, right, became controlling because he worried she would share his secret. Last year, she said she said she could no longer hide the truth . The couple had been married less than 18 months at the time of their deaths. The case fell cold as investigators found . no apparent motives and believed that the Brinks could have been . victims of mistaken identity. Ottawa County Sheriff's Capt. Mark Bennett told Michigan Live . that several civilians, retired officers and sheriff's detectives are . expected to return to the town to testify about the on-scene . investigation. The trial is expected to take at least two weeks. If convicted, Wyngarden would face a sentence of life in prison.","Ryan Wyngarden charged with shooting dead Rick and Gail Brink in 1987 because he was jealous of their relationship .

Rangers in Virunga National Park reported hearing a loud explosion at 3:45 a.m. and then seeing lava flowing from the crater of the 10,033-foot volcano. ""I first thought (it) was the sound of war. I thought there was fighting again near our park station,"" said Innocent Mburanumwe, warden for the southern sector of Virunga National Park. ""Then I saw the mountain was on fire with sparks flying. We could see that we were not in immediate danger here at Rumangabo, but there are many people who live to the south of the volcano, where the lava is heading as I speak."" Nyamuragira is 15 miles (25 kilometers) north of the city of Goma and its 600,000 residents, but Mburanumwe said in a blog posting that lava flows from the mountain were unlikely to threaten human populations. Lava flows from another park volcano, Nyiragongo, destroyed parts of Goma in 2002. The wildlife authority said the Nyamuragira eruption was likely to destroy habitat for 40 chimpanzees on the volcano's lower slopes. Virunga National Park is also home to 200 endangered mountain gorillas, but they live on the slopes of the Mikena volcano to the east of Nyamuragira. The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History calls Nyamuragira the continent's most active volcano, with 42 eruptions since 1885. Its most recent eruption ended in December 2006.","Lava flowing down southern flank of Mount Nyamuragira, park rangers report .

Thirty-one of the passengers who were aboard the ill-fated February 2013 Carnival Triumph voyage turned cruise from hell are looking for compensation for their pain and suffering in a civil case that began last week. Emotions were high in the Miami courtroom as passengers took the stand to describe the five days adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with very little food, sewage-filled decks and near total darkness at night. 'I think about the smell, the stench and the bad things. All the memories come flooding back, and I can't stop them, testified 74-year-old Jean Cripps, who like the rest of the plaintiffs says the experience left emotional marks that have remained in the year since the headline-grabbing cruise. Nightmarish: Passengers revealed gruesome details of their ordeal after enduring five days of overflowing toilets, feces-covered decks and overpowering stench . 'I did not get physically injured. I got mentally injured,' said Cripps, who suffers from Parkinson's disease and whose husband is diabetic. 'The whole experience never ends...It's over and over again.' According to CNN, U.S. District Judge Donald Graham made a sweeping ruling prior to testimony that Carnival is indeed responsible for the fire that left the cruise helpless and adrift. 'It is highly likely that Carnival was responsible for a reasonably probable causes to which the accident could have be (sic) attributed. Here, the facts of the occurrence warrant the inference of negligence,' Graham wrote. However, the judge also ruled that the passengers, per their agreements with Carnival, were not guaranteed a safe cruise and therefor the company was not in breach of contract. Nevertheless, the passengers will . continue to testify to the extent of their emotional distress and . injuries for at least another week in an attempt to convince the judge . they deserve compensation from Carnival. Those . include testimonies like the Cripps', who emphasized an extreme fear of . physical injury during the debacle--not least of all because Alton . Crisp went without his diabetes medication for days--and other . passengers' with less tangible but far more stomach-turning flirtations . with disaster. Carnival failure? The Carnival Triumph was anything but after a fire knocked out power and left 3,000 passengers without power, with very little food, and fearing for their lives in some cases . Suffering after a year: Now 31 passengers have filed a civil suit against Carnival and want compensation for the emotional trauma some of them say they relive even now, a year later . Like Fleda Key, who described having terrible diarrhea on the already feces-covered ship and the distinct lack of usable toilets. 'There was lots of urine and feces all the way up to the rim of every one,' said the 68-year-old. '(I) choked away the smell...I was fearful, downright afraid and scared.' 'I walked through water and feces and urine, no telling what else,' Key's daugher Michelle Key agreed on the stand. 'We would slip and slide through greasy, gross, slippery muck.' Like many of the passengers, the Keys said they feared they wouldn't make it home alive from the trip. Houston-based plaintiff's attorney Frank Spagnoletti said each passenger should receive anywhere from $30,000 to $1 million in compensation, depending on the severity of their injuries. 'There's documented evidence with regard to any number of plaintiffs that show that they were physically injured, and there is ample documented evidence that shows that all of the plaintiffs were injured mentally because of the way they were exposed to this,' he said in his opening statement. Miami attorney Curtis Mase, representing Carnival, said the claims of injuries are overblown. 'There are a number who I believe deserve nothing. And I will tell you this, the one or two that I can think of who have significant injuries, they're very much in the minority and there are only one or two,' Mase said. Steep: The attorney representing the plaintiffs said they're asking for between $30,000 and $1 million for each of the 31 passengers . Inhumane conditions: Passengers were reduced to going to the bathroom in biohazard bags and placing excrement outside their cabins in the hallways .","31 passengers who were stranded aboard the Carnival Triumph in February 2013 are alleging the company is responsible for their suffering .

Despite having missed the break, the peerless jockey was happy to bide his time towards the rear as the keen-travelling My Ambivalent took the field along at a brisk pace. Irish challenger Royal Diamond was also prominent in the early stages, as was home favourite Fawkner and big Japanese hope Admire Rakti, who finished last and had to be put down after he collapsed upon his return from the track. The landscape of the race changed markedly around the home turn as the Ed Dunlop-trained Red Cadeaux gained a slight lead two furlongs out and fleetingly looked poised for a famous success at the age of eight. Admire Rakti started as the favorite but collapsed and died afterwards . Admire Rakti was leading the field round the bend early on in the race . Australian Governor General Peter Cosgrove (left) presents the trophy to winning owner  Christoph Berglar . Model Gigi Hadid was pretty in pink at the Melbourne Cup . But Moore, who also claimed the Cox Plate aboard the Aidan O'Brien-trained Adelaide towards the end of October, and Protectionist had other ideas. The splits arrived beautifully as the pace quickened inside the final furlong, which unquestionably played to the strengths of Wohler's inmate, who surged handsomely clear for a decisive triumph. Who Shot Thebarman and Signoff finished third and fourth respectively, while Godolphin's Willing Foe, trained by Saeed bin Suroor, ran a blinder in fifth spot. Moore said: 'He's won very easily, like a very good horse. 'I was struggling for a position early on, but I had so much horse under me. 'I'm very pleased for him (Wohler), his record is very good. 'I've got to thank Michelle (Moore's wife) at home because I've been away a lot. 'You need to win these races for it to be worthwhile. 'It's very special.' Wohler praised Moore's role in the Protectionist fairytale. He said: 'Ryan couldn't have the position that he'd liked to have had, but he was so patient. 'When they came round the last bend he just needed to have the right gap and he found it. Flemington was packed as the Aussies turned out for Melbourne Cup day in their thousands . Protectionist trainer Andreas Wohler (left) and English jockey Moore lift the Melbourne Cup aloft . 'He (Protectionist) quickened so well and Ryan is a superstar. 'He stays and has a nice turn of foot. We just needed a smooth run and the jockey was absolutely great. 'We have had great success all around the world, but this is the biggest of all. 'This is a moment we won't forget.' After being among the front-runners in the early going, Admire Rakti faded suddenly midway through the race. Racing Victoria chief steward Terry Bailey said on the TV broadcast that the seven-year-old Japanese stayer collapsed and died shortly after returning to the stalls. Dr Brian Stewart, Racing Victoria's head of veterinary and equine welfare, later issued a statement saying the cause of death has yet to be determined, 'although the circumstances of the horse's passing are very rare' Admire Rakti, owned by Riichi Kondo and trained by Tomoyuki Umeda, carried top weight of 58.5 kilograms (129 pounds) in the fourth-fastest Cup ever run. Stewart said a postmortem examination would be conducted at the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital. 'Our sympathies are extended at this time to the owner Mr. Kondo, trainer Mr. Umeda and his staff who cared deeply for their horse and are naturally saddened by their tragic loss,' he said in the statement. Briton Moore tips his cap when swarmed by photographers after the country's biggest race of the year . Jockey Zac Purton said he could tell there was something wrong with his horse early in the race. 'I knew he was in trouble when he didn't tow me into the race around halfway from home,' Purton was quoted as saying by the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 'So I eased him down straight away, the horse's welfare comes first. 'It's very sad. He gave me a great thrill at Caulfield and for this to happen to him is just not fair.' In another post-race incident, seventh-place Araldo broke its leg on the way back to the stalls and had to be euthanized. Racing Victoria said the horse was spooked by a flag waved by a person in the crowd and, in retreating, kicked out and fractured a pastern bone in its hind leg on a fence near the path. Protectionist is now set to continue his racing career in Australia under the tutelage of trainer Kris Lees. Luke Murrell, director of part-owners Australian Bloodstock, said: 'We'll talk to Kris and Andreas, but I think we'd look like giving him a lead-up run before the BMW (in Sydney next year). Asked about Royal Ascot, Murrell said: 'It's a possibility, for sure. There are lots of options.' Dunlop hailed Red Cadeaux, running in the Melbourne Cup for a fourth time, as 'the greatest bridesmaid ever'. The Newmarket handler said: 'He's always susceptible to a younger horse but I'm very proud. 'The way the race was run we were in front plenty soon enough for us and the winner was very good on the day. 'We'll have to come back again, but we'll just see how he is as he's old. 'However, I would like to bring him to Sydney in the autumn. 'He's just been an amazing horse, he must be the greatest bridesmaid ever.' Bin Suroor was especially satisfied with the outcome after his other contender, Cavalryman, was a late defection from the race. Moore was all smiles after getting his hands on the prize for winning the Melbourne Cup . Moore was happy to play up for the photographers after his big win Down Under . He said: 'We understand what happened with Cavalryman, it was up to the vets. 'I'm happy with Willing Foe, he ran a good race and was beaten by a better horse. 'We'll keep him in mile-and-six staying races and, who knows, he could come back.' Seismos, trained by Marco Botti, finished a creditable ninth from a tough draw in stall one. Botti said: 'There was nothing Craig (Williams, jockey) could really do with the draw he had, but he finished the race well.' John Gosden felt Gatewood, who came home in 12th place, did not see out the two-mile trip. Moore salutes the jubilant crowd after running home Protectionist at the lucrative meet Down Under . Moore was the centre of attention during one of his greatest afternoons in the sport . The Clarehaven handler said: 'He ran a great race, he just didn't stay. 'It wasn't the usual Melbourne Cup as My Ambivalent did her own thing from the front. 'He'll come back home now and have a break until the spring.' Despite having shown up promisingly for a long way, the Johnny Murtagh-trained Royal Diamond beat home just two horses. Stablemate Mutual Regard, impressive winner of the Ebor at York in the summer, fared a little better in 14th place, while the headstrong My Ambivalent was 17th. But the day belonged to Moore, who was typically quick to deflect the glory. The jockey said: 'I've just got to thank Andreas, who did a marvellous job bringing this horse all the way down here for a long-term plan. 'He did a top-class job and all I had to do was point him. 'He's a very good horse, he's still improving, and who knows how far he could go. 'It's probably the greatest race in the world and I hope everybody enjoyed their day.'","Briton Ryan Moore rode Protectionist to victory in the Melbourne Cup .

fff048b7c5b9578c3a494d42a5bece64753af818,"(CNN) -- Even as they were rejecting as far-fetched an Australian company's assertion that it may have identified the resting place of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 -- thousands of miles from where investigators have been searching -- experts acknowledged Wednesday that they have little choice but to check it out. ""The investigators are going to be hard-pressed to blow this off,"" said Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general for the Department of Transportation. ""I think, at this point, because of the lack of results where they've been searching for six weeks, they're almost stuck. They have to go look."" The Adelaide-based firm GeoResonance has said that electromagnetic fields captured by airborne multispectral images some 118 miles (190 kilometers) off the coast of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal showed evidence of aluminum, titanium, copper and other elements that could have been part of the Boeing 777-200ER, which disappeared from radar on March 8 while en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing. ""The company is not declaring this is MH370, however it should be investigated,"" GeoResonance said Tuesday in a news release. GeoResonance Managing Director Pavel Kursa, citing intellectual property concerns, would not explain how the imaging works. Nevertheless, the company got its wish on Wednesday, when Bangladesh sent two navy frigates into the Bay of Bengal to the location cited by GeoResonance. ""As soon as they get there, they will search and verify the information,"" Commodore Rashed Ali, director of Bangladesh navy intelligence, told CNN in Dhaka. The chief coordinator of the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, retired Chief Air Marshal Angus Houston, held out little optimism that any such search would prove fruitful. He told Sky News International that the search area in the Indian Ocean had been set based on pings believed to have emanated from one or both of the plane's voice and data recorders. ""The advice from the experts is that's probably where the aircraft lost power and, somewhere close to that, it probably entered the water."" CNN aviation expert Miles O'Brien said GeoResonance's claims are not supported by experts. ""My blood is boiling,"" he told CNN's ""New Day."" ""I've talked to the leading experts in satellite imaging capability at NASA, and they know of no technology that is capable of doing this. I am just horrified that a company would use this event to gain attention like this."" He called on company officials to offer ""a full explanation"" for their assertion, which he said appeared to be based on ""magic box"" technology. Sending investigators to the Bay of Bengal would draw away from the limited resources that are focused in the southern Indian Ocean, O'Brien said. But that won't stop them from going, he predicted. ""I think they have to,"" he said. ""It's a public relations thing now."" David Gallo, director of special projects at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, also expressed skepticism. ""It's so revolutionary, and I don't know anyone that knows of this kind of technology,"" he told CNN. ""And I know most of the people in this business."" 'We were being ignored' The company's director, David Pope, said he had not wanted to go public, but did so only after his information was disregarded. ""We're a large group of scientists, and we were being ignored, and we thought we had a moral obligation to get our findings to the authorities,"" he told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday. GeoResonance's technology was created to search for nuclear, biological and chemical weaponry under the ocean's surface or beneath the earth in bunkers, Pope said. And the company's news release said its search technology was reliable. ""In the past, it had been successfully applied to locate submersed structures, ships, munitions and aircraft,"" it said. ""In some instances objects that were buried under layers of silt could not be identified by other means."" The company began its search four days after the plane went missing and sent officials initial findings on March 31, Pope said. It followed up with a full report on April 15, which it would not make public. ""We only send our report to Government authorities as it contains the exact coordinates of what we believe to be the wreckage of an aircraft,"" Pope said Wednesday in an e-mail. By going public with their conclusion, if not their data, the company says it hopes it will spur officials to take its claim seriously. Malaysian authorities contacted GeoResonance on Tuesday and were ""very interested, very excited"" about the findings, Pope said. Inmarsat, the company whose satellite had the last known contact with MH370, remains ""very confident"" in its analysis that the plane ended up in the southern Indian Ocean, a source close to the MH370 investigation told CNN. The Inmarsat analysis is ""based on testable physics and mathematics,"" the source said, and has been reviewed by U.S., British and Malaysian authorities as well as an independent satellite company. Is GeoResonance on to something? Relatives hear new details . On Tuesday, relatives of the 239 passengers and crew heard new details from officials, including audio recordings of conversations between the plane and a control tower that had not been released before but appeared to contain nothing out of the ordinary. ""Malaysia three seven zero, contact Ho Chi Minh 120.9, good night,"" says a voice identified by Malaysian officials as that of a radar controller in Kuala Lumpur. ""Good night Malaysian three seven zero,"" answers a male voice believed to be a Flight 370 crew member. A preliminary report on the plane, submitted last week to the International Civil Aviation Organization, will be released to the public Thursday, the Malaysian Ministry of Transportation said Wednesday. ""The report will be very basic, I assume -- most initial, preliminary reports are,"" said Schiavo, the aviation analyst. ""Just the facts, basic things."" But she predicted it will also lay out what is not known, as well as a blueprint for the path ahead and, as such, could prove helpful to family members of those who were aboard. Plane audio recording played in public for first time to Chinese families . More intense underwater search . Seven weeks of intense searching have found nothing linked to the plane. Though some ships will stay on the Indian Ocean to gather any debris, the international air effort to find the plane is over. The likelihood of finding any debris on the ocean's surface is ""very remote indeed,"" since it has probably become waterlogged and sunk, Houston said. So crews will scour a larger area of the ocean floor -- 23,000 square miles (60,000 square kilometers) -- in a process that could take eight months, officials said. The next phase will use private contractors and could cost about $56 million. Houston said that could stretch to 12 months if any glitches with equipment or weather were to occur. He was confident the aircraft will be found, though perhaps not soon. ""Nothing happens fast underwater,"" he said. ""It could take months and months and months and months."" The Bluefin-21, which has searched the 121-square-mile (314-square-kilometer) area around where pings were thought to have been detected, resumed searching a nearby area of the ocean floor at about 1 a.m. ET on Wednesday -- its 17th mission, according to a U.S. Navy source. New phase to include private contractors, may cost $60 million . Journalist Farid Ahmed reported from Dhaka; CNN's Anna Coren reported from Adelaide, Australia; Miguel Marquez and David Molko reported from Western Australia; Mitra Mobasherat reported from Kuala Lumpur; Tom Watkins, Holly Yan and Mariano Castillo reported and wrote from Atlanta; and Mike Ahlers contributed from Washington.

But experts say this is the ideal time to plan a foreign holiday after travel agents began slashing the price of package trips yesterday and it emerged that a strong pound is giving tourists up to 28 per  cent more for their money than a year ago. Operators are cutting the prices of deals to popular resorts in Turkey, Greece and Spain as competition begins during the peak selling season for holidays after Christmas. Bargain breaks: Thomson is offering 14 nights in Florida for £1,119 per person - a saving of £670 per couple . When package prices, meal costs and . exchange rates were assessed together for ten winter destinations in . January, Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt came out top for value. A week in the Red Sea resort costs just £399 – less than half of mid-haul competitor Jumeirah Beach, Dubai. The strong pound also buys tourists around £55 per £500, or 12.5 per cent more in Sharm than during the same period last year. The . best value long-haul destinations include Orlando in Florida, Negril in . Jamaica, and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, according to a . survey for the Post Office. Bali, . in Indonesia, is the place to  go to get the most from the pound, with . sterling up 28 per cent on  the weak rupiah – buying the equivalent of . £108 more spending money for each £500 exchanged compared to 12 months . ago. Cape Town  in South Africa is also great value, with tourists . getting the equivalent of £91 more per £500 because of  the 20 per cent . slump in the value of the rand. A . seven-night break, departing January 1 from London to Orlando in . Florida costs £719, researchers said, while a holiday in Playa  del . Carmen, in Mexico, was £899  and a seven-night stay in Dubai  was £983. Thomson is offering seven nights for couples to Marrakech for £399 per person - a saving of £330 per couple . Most expensive of the resorts surveyed was Penang in Malaysia where the package costs as much £1,314. Paul . Havenhand, the head of travel at the Post Office, said: ‘Egypt’s  Red . Sea resorts have always been a good value option but it’s not  just . Sharm el-Sheikh where sun-seekers will find their pounds  stretch . further. ‘Sterling buys . more holiday cash in all ten of our January hotspots, with the biggest . benefits to be found in Cape Town and Bali.’ January is prime selling season for holiday firms, with some cutting as much as £360 per person off short and long-haul breaks. Thomas . Cook has slashed seven nights in May at a four-star resort in Gran . Canaria by £200 per person to £419. Thomson First Choice has 14 nights . in Mauritius in May from £1,599 a head, saving £740 per couple. The travel agency is also offering a seven night stay at a five-star resort in Belek, Turkey, for £1,769 which saves £320. Thomas Cook is offering seven nights in Olu Deniz in Turkey all-inclusive from £1179 per person . A seven night stay in Barbados has been cut by £442 to £1,159 per person. However, . British holidaymakers are expected to spend more on their annual . getaway in 2014 rising to an average of £1,035 per person, a new study . has found. That will include £617 on the hotel and flights, and £459 in spending money. A typical break will last 9.6 nights, staying in a Spanish beach resort, and self-catered accommodation. Next year will also see a 14 per cent fall in the number of Brits opting for a staycation - a break within Britain. Holidaymakers are more likely to jet off on long-haul flights, research by online comparison service Travel Supermarket shows. Popular destinations will include the likes of U.S (7 per cent), and Turkey (3 per cent). Spain continues to be the nation's favourite country in which to take a foreign holiday. But the number of us who expect to be visiting will fall from 14 per cent this year to 12 per cent next. Over a third of British holidaymakers (37 per cent) expect to spend more on their holiday in 2014. Thomas Cook is offering seven nights in Ayia Napa self-catering from £1,529 for a family of four . In 2013 the total sum spent was 1,035 pounds, or 41 pounds less than 2014. A . quarter of those who plan to spend more (25 per cent) saved up for a . nicer break, while 23 per cent cut back on last year's travels to afford . it. Almost four in ten Brits (39 per cent) took a beach holiday in 2013 but only 29 per cent plan to do the same for in 2014. Instead, Brits are craving culture, history, shopping or entertainment. Research shows city breaks were five per cent more popular in 2013 than they were in 2012 (35 per cent, 30 per cent). Excluding those who have yet to decide, five per cent more holidaymakers plan on taking two or more breaks in 2014 compared to 2013 (70 per cent, 65 per cent). A quarter are set to take exactly two holidays in 2014, which is the national average. The summer months of June, July and August are by far the most popular months to travel in 2014. Trips in June are potentially inspired by the FIFA World Cup, which kicks off on June 12 in Brazil. A total of four per cent of Brits surveyed revealed they are going to a destination with a good atmosphere to watch the tournament. Thomson First Choice is offering 14 nights in Mauritius from £1,599 per person . While a further four per cent claim the World Cup might inspire them to go to Brazil one day. The trend of people booking all-inclusive breaks in 2014 is set to rise by two per cent. Nearly two in five single young professionals (39 per cent) want to have an adventure. Those most tempted by a relaxing holiday are couples who do not plan to have children (73 per cent) and couples with grown up children (71 per cent). Almost one in five families with young children go on holiday to experience new cultures (19 per cent), but the majority (67 per cent) claim that spending time with the family is their main motivation for traveling. Bob Atkinson, travel expert from TravelSupermarket said: 'Spain has long been a favourite beach destination for Brits looking to unwind. Airtours is offering seven nights in Sharm el Sheikh in Egyt from £1,799 for a family of four . 'It continues to offer great value in terms of affordable holidays and a reliable experience for holidaymakers. 'However it's great to see people having the confidence to try new, less traditional, holidays as they look to make the most of their time and money overseas. 'With economic signals indicating a slow but steady upturn in many countries, Portugal, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria and Cyprus are emerging as popular holiday alternatives to the nation's favourite, Spain. 'Meanwhile, destinations such as Sri Lanka, Dubai, Florida, Cancun and Egypt are ideal for those looking at experiencing more long haul locations for their beach breaks. 'The fact that so many of us are keen to enjoy a city break demonstrates how keen we are to make use of the UK's proximity to exciting, and increasingly accessible cities across Europe. Cities offering low cost of living such as Budapest, Tallinn, Vilnius and Riga, will continue to soar in popularity, but for those looking to splash more cash, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Las Vegas are all increasing in popularity as people travel for special occasions or for a treat. 'Regardless of where you choose to go, January will always be a key booking time for holidaymakers, so my advice will always be to think about what you want from your break and research your options via a price comparison website to help decide on the best holiday options for you. 'This way, you can book with confidence knowing you're getting the best value break possible.'","Destinations expected to enjoy price cuts include Turkey, Greece and Spain .

fff0d92c6b4fdb0ef79eb101ba90939f8c462141,"The future of NASA's planet-hunting Kepler space observatory was in question Wednesday after a part that helps aim the spacecraft stopped working, the U.S. space agency said. Controllers found Tuesday that Kepler had gone into a ""safe mode"" and one of the reaction wheels needed to orient the spacecraft would not spin, Associate NASA Administrator John Grunsfeld told reporters. NASA engineers are trying to figure out whether they can get the balky part back into service or whether they can resume control by another method, Grunsfeld said. ""We're not ready to call the mission over,"" he said. But at roughly 40 million miles from Earth, ""Kepler is not in a place where I can go up and rescue it."" Another Earth called a certainty . The Kepler mission has identified 132 planets beyond our solar system since its launch in 2009, leading scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them. It has gone into a ""safe mode"" with its solar panels facing back at the sun, giving controllers intermittent communication with the craft as it spins. Three new planets could host life . The probe was built with four reaction wheels and needs three of them -- one for each axis -- to aim its telescope precisely at a distant star, deputy project manager Charlie Sobeck said. One failed in July 2012, leaving it with only two functioning wheels at this time, Sobeck said. Kepler shut itself down after it was pointing in the wrong direction, Sobeck said. He said it was ""reasonable to suspect"" the failure of the reaction wheel was the cause, but scientists hadn't confirmed that. More news about Kepler . The $600 million mission was designed to operate for three and a half to six years.

fff156ae1611cbaf243975c55681e735395c6368,"(CNN) -- At long last, Maria Toorpakai Wazir can indulge her life's greatest love without fear of persecution. Hounded out of the notoriously dangerous tribal region that borders Pakistan and Afghanistan -- once referred to as ""Hell's door knocker"" -- salvation has been found thousands of miles away on a different continent. She survived death threats, spent countless hours alone in her room and masqueraded as a boy for years. And all for her love of squash. Now Pakistan's number one female player, who is ranked 53rd in the world, is homing in on her quest to become the best female player in the world, under the tutelage of Jonathon Power, the Canadian star whose name was inscribed on the first racket she ever owned. It is a fairytale story that has taken the 22-year-old a world away from a treacherous existence in the mountains of Pakistan, to Power's academy in Toronto, and morphed her into an agent for social change in her native country. ""I think positive and I do positive so I think people in Pakistan need to be educated, need to take part in sports and skills so they have high integrity, high self-esteem and so they use energy in a positive way,"" she told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""They will start holding rackets and bats rather than holding guns and grenades. I don't want militancy or Talibanisation -- I just want a brighter future for all the kids. I don't want them to end up as suicide bombers."" Growing up in South Waziristan provided Wazir with a crash course in conservatism, a prevalent theme in a territory with a reputation for fierce tribalism. ""It was an area in between mountains and mud houses and as it was 100 or 200 years ago,"" she explained. ""The girls are deprived of all those basic rights. They stay inside the home and get married off at a young age. ""My whole family was different to the rest of the people in the area -- you could see the progress, the different mindset -- but they were still living in the Stone Age. ""They had no awareness about education or any health or exercise, or women's rights or child's rights. They didn't know how any education can be important for one person as a human."" Exasperated at the barriers placed in front of her, Wazir took drastic action aged just four, burning all her dresses, putting on her brother's clothes and shearing off her long, dark hair. ""My dad believes that it is your choice and your right to live the way you want,"" she said. ""He laughed and he gave me a boyish name Genghis Khan, the greatest warrior in the history of the world. He said 'So, we have a fifth son, and his name is Genghis Khan.'"" However for Wazir and her family, domestic tolerance came at a price. In a society cloaked by repression and inequality, even being seen unaccompanied in public could be perceived as a betrayal of her culture and Muslim religion. And the liberal attitude of her father, Shamsul Qayyum Wazir, who encouraged his wife to continue her education and allowed their daughter to play outside with her brothers, was contradictory to the prevailing attitude of ultra-conservatism. So much so that he family decided they'd had enough after a campaign of intimidation that included the stoning of the family house, attempts on their lives and an imposed spell in an asylum for the father. The family moved to the city of Peshawar -- another Taliban stronghold -- where Wazir's scrapes intensified, with one scuffle leading to a head injury that required 12 stitches. Realizing she needed to channel this aggression, her father enrolled her in weightlifting classes at a local sports club, keeping up the pretense she was a boy. Wazir went on to win a junior weightlifting championship, but she also grew fixated on squash, having seen it played on her breaks from training. She earned a place at a squash academy run by the Pakistan Air Force, though she had to reveal her true identity to the director. Such was his delight at seeing a girl enraptured by squash he donated a racket to Maria bearing the name of Jonathon Power -- who won 36 top level events during his 15-year career at the top of the sport. But as word spread of her emerging talent, the anonymity Wazir had reveled in for so long evaporated. ""Attitudes changed, they started bullying but I used to find a way,"" she explained. ""I used to go early in the morning when there was no-one in my way. ""I used to repair those balls that were bad and torn in the squash court that guys used to throw away with tape and glue."" Taliban's unwanted attention . A steady improvement in her game led to appearances in high profile tournaments and prominence in the Pakistani media. Awards from then president Pervez Musharraf and prime minister Shaukat Aziz were a mark of her pioneering spirit, but they also attracted the Taliban's unwanted attention. ""It was exhausting at every step,"" she said. ""It was hard to let people know all I want is to play squash. That's how I can live happy but I had to change my life with time. ""For the last eight years I've been trying hard to come through to the common people and today I'm getting threats from Taliban. I was totally exhausted. I didn't know what to do. ""I stopped going to the academy because it's the biggest dishonor if a daughter is kidnapped. That's (why) I locked myself in my room and started hitting from evening to morning."" Her absence was noted and when she relayed the threats she'd received the issue was debated in parliament, who reacted by beefing up security around her. ""They put so many attack posts on the way to the squash court and around the squash court too,"" she said. ""Above the squash court they put snipers. ""I was going once a week or twice a month but at that time I completely stopped because if a bomb happened -- there is so much glass in the squash court itself -- it would kill the innocent kids. ""I didn't want it to be the reason so I stopped going and started playing in my room for three-and-a-half years."" It was during this time Wazir says she knew she had to leave Pakistan to follow her dream. ""My dad said 'If a baby bird wants to learn flying, he has to leave the nest' and at that time I realized I cannot learn flying while am here. ""For three-and-a-half years I didn't get any email from anyone and one day I got an email back from Jonathan Power saying that he's going to help me, support me, teach me how to play squash so I can play at tournaments and become a world champion for Pakistan."" Power himself was sent to London as a 12-year-old to train with former Pakistani world champion and all-time squash great Jahangir Khan, and was immersed in the culture of Khan's country, traveling to play there on many occasions during his career. Wazir's plea struck a chord with Power, who flew her to Toronto and has since been working on building her strength and stamina, and molding the rawness of her technique into a formidable weapon. ""I recognized right away this girl is special, she's very courageous girl and I wanted to help,"" said Power. ""She'll run through that wall 10 times until she finally breaks it. She thinks working hard just means killing your body and you'll get better, but sometimes you have to work smart. ""It's so rare to find somebody who has so much drive and so much passion, who is just dying to absorb knowledge. I think she's going to make it to number one in the world.

The weather is set fair for London but the micro-climate about to be generated by 80,000 people inside Wembley Stadium is brewing up a storm. Froch’s thunderous punches and the lightning fists of Groves threaten to make this a Saturday night as electrifying as it is historic. But which of them will be struck down? The warrior with the huge heart and unbreakable jaw, or the high-tech strategist with the creative thought process? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Froch and Groves square up at an intense weigh-in . Storm brewing: George Groves and Carl Froch are heading into a titanic clash at Wembley . Weigh in: The two boxers salute the crowd after being weighed at Wembly Arena . Not that either of these fighting men is entirely devoid of the other’s prime qualities but it is the broad differences which are dividing opinion so sharply. The Nottingham Cobra and London’s Saint George each predict one-sided victories by knock-out which will leave no scope for the kind of controversy ignited by the abrupt conclusion to their first, dramatic encounter. You pay your money – either to be there, to watch on TV or place a bet – and you take your choice. The great British public are split down the middle. The bookmakers have Froch as the marginal favourite but Groves still close to even money. A majority of the fraternity of the ring appear to favour Froch – with Barry McGuigan, Amir Khan,  Lennox Lewis, Anthony Joshua and legendary American promoter Bob Arum among those telling me that experience will out – but there are plenty of dissenters. War: The two fought out a brutal encounter in Manchester in the first fight . Controversy: The fight was stopped by referee Howard Foster in the ninth round - perhaps prematurely . What everyone seems to agree upon is that Groves needs to win early or Froch gets him late. Everyone, that is, except the  combatants themselves. Groves says: ‘I expect to KO Carl with a left hook in the third round but if he survives I will dominate even more the longer it goes.’ Froch says: ‘I will box properly this time and take George out in the middle to late rounds. Unless he actually does come out looking for that third-round win, in which case I stop him early.’ Welcome to confused.com. What we know for sure is that the 26-year-old Groves gained the nation’s respect with his instant flooring of Froch six months ago and the lead he held on the scorecards before referee Howard Foster jumped hastily between them in the ninth round. More significantly, he also caught the attention of the world super-middleweight champion. Froch went into their first fight underestimating Groves to the point of under-preparing and was so irritated by the presumptuous attitude of an opponent 10 years his junior that he fought with  near-suicidal anger instead of a  calculating brain. ‘I’m not making that mistake again,’ he says. ‘I’ve trained back to the physical  condition I achieved in my 20s.’ Workout: Froch works out in Broadmarsh Shopping Centre in Nottingham earlier this week . Looking good: Groves hits the pads at Westfield Shopping Centre, west London . That has been done by a return to road running instead of cutting corners on the treadmill and with a tough strengthening regime which has included, most eye-catchingly, the repeated battering of a lorry tyre with a heavy metal bar. Froch has also addressed his  complacency issue by engaging a sports psychologist. He says: ‘I will be fighting with my mind not my emotions. I won’t be charging out again looking for a quick one-shot KO to teach him a lesson — and  getting caught myself. ‘Instead of the worst Carl Froch of my career, George is now facing the best Carl Froch there’s ever been.’ To which Groves says: ‘That’s just not true. He should have lost the first fight and he can’t win this fight. I’m a better boxer than him in every aspect and he just can’t change.’ Must see: Media and fans pack into Wembley arena to witness the weigh-in . Fighting talk: Froch and Groves once again went at it during the weigh-in . On the opposite page, McGuigan, who is grooming Carl Frampton as his own heir to greatness in Belfast, advises Froch to make some basic adjustments ‘not least by keeping his left hand up by the side of his head to block those big Groves rights.’ Whether he will pay heed is open to doubt. Froch knows the risk entailed in keeping that arm low but it has always been one he is prepared to take. Armed with that iron chin he is willing to absorb a big shot so he can keep jabbing and hooking with his left from unusual and unexpected angles, adhering to the ring maxim that it is the punches  opponents do not see coming which are most devastating. While the late Friday afternoon timing of the weigh-in could create a stamina issue for Groves if he has to toil down to the 12-stone limit — even though he denies he is not a 12-round fighter — the real key to this intriguing contest lies secreted deep in the contrasting personalities of these two men. Confident: Froch says he will be in better shape and a better frame of mind for the rematch . Both are proud and excited to  be the central characters in a passion play being staged before the  biggest boxing audience in Britain since the war. But while Groves says ‘80,000 or 8,000 is the same  to me,’ Froch declares himself  ‘honoured and humbled by the magnitude of the occasion.’  Groves reports knowledge and experience gained from the original clash, while Froch says: ‘You can’t beat a man like me with bravado.’ Groves, as he prepares to move on to German promoters Sauerland, is setting himself the target of ‘an impressive performance to make the world sit up and take notice. Froch says: ‘I have no real interest in becoming a celebrity. It’s the winning that comes first.’ The scale of interest has been driven by the public’s love affair with these Battles of Britain and such rematches make a lot of money for all concerned. Better? Groves said he 'expects' to beat Froch in the third round with a left hook . Promoter Eddie Hearn took a gamble booking Wembley for the night after an England match but he has successfully tapped into a popular mood of fascination. Projected Sky pay-per-view sales of a million may fall just short of Ricky Hatton’s record 1.2m for his Las Vegas fight with Floyd Mayweather but if it is achieved then Froch will bank anything up to £10m, Groves close to £2m. Being the defending champion has its purse privileges, which Froch has earned the hard way as he goes into his 12th straight world-title fight, all but one against the elite fighters in his division. Although, at coming up to 37, he has no plans for imminent retirement he was asked this week how he would like to be remembered whenever that day comes. Froch replied: ‘As a warrior who feared no man and ducked no-one.’ Time for action: The pair go face to face for real at Wembley stadium on Saturday night . As one who predicted he would stop Groves in the ninth round of the first fight, I expect Froch to be fractionally more patient before his world-class battle-hardening prevails again, in the 10th or 11th. But whatever the result, that  epitaph of his has already been assured. Froch-Groves II, Unfinished Business, is live on Sky Sports Box Office.","Carl Froch and George Groves prepare to clash at Wembley .

The North Korean insults come after President Obama visited  South Korea and its president Park Geun-hye for two days in which both leaders asked that North Korea not proceed with its nuclear program. The Committee for Peaceful Reunification of Korea CPRK)  said, 'Park Geun-hye's recent behavior with Obama was like a mean immature girl begging gangsters to beat up someone she does not like. Or a crafty prostitute eagerly trying to frame someone by giving her body to a powerful pimp.' South Korean President Park Geun-Hye (R) and US President Barack Obama (L) arrive to receive a briefing from United Nations Commander General of US-ROK Combined Forces Command in Seoul during Obama's two day visit . The Korean Newws Agency (KCNA) said the official English translation of North Korea's description of Park was as a 'capricious whore.' North Korea called Obama 'master' and Park Guen-hye his 'puppet' and said that Park would pay a 'dear price,' reports The Guardian. Satellite imagery has shown an increase in activity at North Korea's nuclear test site and Park warned that Pyongang was ready to execute another atomic test. Both Obama and Park threatened North Korea with harsher rules and economic sanctions on the already poor country. They encouraged China to speak against it's ally's nuclear threats. The CPRK called the both Park and Obama's statements 'intolerable insults' against their leadership. US President Barack Obama (L) and South Korean President Park Geun-Hye (R) attend a joint press conference at the presidential Bule House oin which they discussed North Korea's nuclear threats . 'In particular, Park Geun-Hye continued to viciously take issue with our dignity, system and nuclear programmes,' it said. They said her remarks were as though she were 'froth(ing) at the mouth.' 'She thus laid bare her despicable true colours as a wicked sycophant and traitor, a dirty comfort woman for the US and despicable prostitute selling off the nation,'  said the KCNA translation. The CPRK claimed that Obama should have 'postponed or shelved his trip' following the ferry full of schoolchildren that sank in South Korea. The CPRK said that Obama was 'utterly indifferent to the sorrow' felt by South Korea after the ferry incident. 'The latest visit by Obama only reaffirmed our long-held belief that might, not words, are the only option to deal with the old enemy US and strengthened our resolve and determination to stick with our policy to fight a full-scale nuclear war,' they said. Pyongang is North Korea rejected South Korea's proposal to absorb the North into the South . 'Park Geun-hye will pay a dear price for abandoning the opportunity we earlier gave and choosing a path of anti-unification and anti-peace and a path to confrontation and war,' they continued. They also likened Park to a 'comfort woman,' a term used to describe women who were sexually enslaved by Japanese soldiers during World War II. The comments will be a controversial topic in South Korea as it's still a touchy subject regarding their relationship with Tokyo. North Korea has been known to criticize South Korean leaders including Park's predecessor Lee Myung-Bak. The attacks on Park have been even more offensive and sexual in nature since she is the first female president in Seoul. Park has expressed her wish to build a trusting relationship with Pyongang but she says she will also remain strong if she faces provocation. Pyongang rejected her proposal to prepare for unification and to attempt to absorb North Korea into South Korea.

And that wasn't the only surprise Mr Mason had in store, as the show's hosts announced that as an engagement present they would donate towards the amount needed to fund surgery to remove excess skin following his dramatic weight loss. Asked if a date had been set for their wedding, Miss Mountain told The View: 'There’s so many things we need to do to take care of Paul first.

Mr Mason's binge eating began in his 20s at the time of his father's death and a deterioration in his mother's health. He quit his job as a postman when his weight stopped him from finishing his rounds. As his weight soared he was left unable to stand or walk before finally becoming bed-ridden and being looked after full time by council carers. Firefighters had to demolish the front wall of his former home so they could drive a fork lift truck inside to lift him out and put him into an ambulance when he needed a hernia operation in 2002. Mr Mason was later given a purpose-built housing association home with extra wide doorways so he could move around. His care bill cost taxpayers an estimated £100,000 a year and is believed to have topped £1million.

The Bank of England figures showed that November saw the biggest rise in unsecured borrowing since February 2008, when Northern Rock was nationalised and the credit crunch took hold. It comes as consumer helplines warn that people would be struggling to make ends meet when the first credit card bills of the year start to arrive this month. Scroll down for video . Experts say Black Friday promotions were probably linked to a new seven-year high in borrowing for UK consumers during November . Statistics released yesterday show that more than £980m was taken out in loans and overdrafts during November, a sharp rise from the average of £728m in the six months before. The report also shows that, despite credit card lending falling from £399m in October to £269m, it remained above the average for the previous six months. Experts said the surge in retail sales around Black Friday - when an estimated £810m was spent online - was probably linked to the increase in borrowing. Research carried out by R3, which represents those working in the insolvency sector, found that more than a quarter of adults were expecting to take on debt to pay for their celebrations. At the same time, banks and credit card companies were competing with offers in a bid to win new customers and balance transfer deals on credit cards became increasingly generous. Martin Beck at the EY Item Club told the Independent that growth rate was 'reminiscent of the credit-fuelled days of the mid-2000s'. And Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, told the Guardian that many households will probably be overstretched. She said: 'While most people will be able to cope with this extra borrowing, we are concerned that many households will have overstretched – particularly over the Christmas period.' Chief executive of the debt charity StepChange Mike O'Connor added that the figures 'point to a worrying rise in people's reliance on credit'. According to the figures, unsecured lending was up 6.9 per cent in November, compared with the previous year. It had grown at its most rapid pace since October 2005. The statistics also showed that consumers have borrowed more than they have paid off almost every month since September 2012. On the business lending side there was a more encouraging picture, with net lending to small and medium-sized businesses rising by £252m in November. It represented the biggest increase since the series was started by the Bank of England in 2011. But net lending to all non-financial businesses fell again by £1.1bn, while the figures showed a slowdown in mortgage lending. According to the R3 research carried out before Christmas, half of those planning to borrow money for the festive period were planning to use an existing credit card, while 24 per cent said they would use overdrafts. Some 14 per cent said they would borrow on a store card. Worryingly, 11 per cent planned to skip other spending commitments, like mortgage payments, while eight per cent expected to need a payday loan. Giles Frampton said: 'Taking on debts is fine so long as they’re affordable and people have a plan for how to pay the debt back. Pressure to spend is acute at Christmas.'","Figures show biggest rise in unsecured borrowing since February 2008 .

The wife of a convicted drugs baron spent  thousands of pounds on Botox, designer handbags and sports cars while claiming benefits, a court heard. Diane Brookhouse, 41, applied for the state handouts after her husband Richard, 45, was jailed for smuggling cocaine and heroin. But rather than living on the breadline, the mother of two enjoyed a lavish lifestyle by  helping him run his illegal  business from behind bars, it is alleged. Trial: Diane Brookhouse (left) collected her husband Richard (right) - who masterminded the operation from his prison cell - on day release from Kirkham open prison and drove him to drugs meetings, the court heard . Warrington Crown Court was told that . Brookhouse was a key player in a drugs ring that imported more than . £15million of heroin and cocaine into the UK via ‘fishing trips’ from . France. Neil Flewitt QC, prosecuting, claimed . she took her husband, who was nearing the end of his 22-year sentence, . to meetings with drug dealing associates while on day release from . prison. He said: ‘She did so, in part at least, in order to obtain the . funds required to maintain a lifestyle that she could not afford to . enjoy through legitimate means.’ Brookhouse also claimed  benefits, he . said, while making a ‘substantial cash deposit’ on her rented property . as well as rental payments that ‘exceeded the amount that she received . by way of housing benefit’. She also ran two luxury cars – a Mercedes CLC 180 Sport and a Volkswagen Golf convertible. Mr Flewitt told jurors that . Brookhouse, of Warrington, Cheshire, spent almost £1,300 at the . hairdressers’, making 16  visits to a Toni and Guy salon in just over a . year. Fists up: Former amateur boxing champion Carl Wall, 36, was described as a 'wholesaler' for whom Mr Brookhouse arranged importations. He admitted conspiracy to supply controlled drugs . And between June 2010 and June 2013, . she also allegedly spent £2,635 on Botox and filler treatments at a . private clinic, which she mostly paid for in cash, and had two . top-of-the range iPhones on £80 contracts. When Brookhouse was arrested, police . also found a £1,215 receipt for a handbag by the designer brand Chloe . and £440 cash in her purse. The brunette is in the dock alongside . co-accused Stephen Crane, 55, of Lutterworth, Leicestershire, and Ikhlaq . Hussain, 25, of Bury. All three deny conspiracy to supply cocaine and . heroin. Brookhouse also denies conspiracy to supply the party drug . mephedrone or M-cat. The court heard that the drugs were trafficked into . Britain by a 19-strong gang using chartered fishing breaks to the . continent as cover. The plot unravelled after a trip to . northern France in April last year when officers in Essex collared two . men loading a van with a haul including cocaine with a street value of . £15million and £400,000 worth of heroin. The other 16 gang members have admitted various charges of conspiracy to supply drugs. Richard Brookhouse, who ran the . operation from his prison cell via smuggled mobile phones, has admitted . the same charge and will be sentenced later. The trial continues.

fff6f8f6b9ff40a563a0a77c3a9d44aad41d9bac,"(CNN) -- A Bahrain court sentenced eight Shiite opposition activists to life in prison after finding them guilty of plotting to overthrow the country's Sunni royal family, state media said Wednesday. They were among 21 people who were convicted on terrorism-related charges in connection with the anti-government protests in the country, the Bahrain News Agency said. Soon after the judge read the verdict, the defendants protested loudly, prompting officials to forcibly remove them from the courtroom. Zainab al-Khawaja, a spectator, protested her father's life sentence by yelling ""God is Great."" She was arrested. Rights groups have urged Bahrain to halt the special military court proceedings, with Human Rights Watch deeming them a violation of international law. ""Most defendants hauled before Bahrain's special military court are facing blatantly political charges, and trials are unfair,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. In London, Britain's foreign office minister for the Middle East, Alistair Burt, said he was ""extremely concerned"" over the sentencing and the nature of many of the charges. ""It is deeply worrying that civilians are being tried before tribunals chaired by a military judge, with reports of abuse in detention, lack of access to legal counsel and coerced confessions,"" he said. In a meeting last week with U.S. President Barack Obama, Bahrain's Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa said he is seeking national dialogue with the protesters. Bahrain's crackdown contradicts statements the prince made, Human Rights Watch said. Bahraini human rights activist Nabeel Rajab said he, too, disapproved of the trials. ""This court does not meet international standards for human rights and for fair trials. The people were sentenced for expressing their opinion and for opposing the government,"" Rajab said. ""This goes against the government saying it wants a dialogue."" Sheikh Ali Salman, head of the opposition Wefaq group, said Wednesday's sentencing goes against the conditions called for by Obama and the international community to restore calm ahead of any dialogue. Khalil Marzooq, a Wefaq leader, said the Shiite organization was reviewing whether to enter into national dialogue. He said the continuing crackdown and trials, not the protests, were hurting the country's international standing. Bahrain is one of several Middle Eastern and North African countries embroiled in anti-government protests. The ruling royal family -- Sunnis in a majority-Shiite nation -- accuses protesters of being motivated by sectarian differences and supported by Iran. Also on trial in Bahrain are dozens of doctors and nurses who are accused of taking control of a hospital during anti-government protests, storing weapons and holding people prisoner. The doctors, their lawyers and international human rights activists say the defendants were tortured to extract confessions.

Prince Andrew has revealed he remained friends with Sarah Ferguson after their divorce 'more for family than anything else'. The royal spoke about the couple's split and continued friendship in a candid interview with US satellite TV channel CNBC. The couple married in 1986 but separated in 1992 and divorced four years later. But they have remained on good terms and have brought up their daughters, Princesses Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24, together. Scroll down for video . Prince Andrew has said he stayed friends with Sarah Ferguson (right) for 'the sake of family' in a  new interview . The couple, pictured at daughter Beatrice's graduation in 2011, have called themselves 'the world's happiest unmarried couple' In his latest interview, to be screened in the US this week, the 54-year-old said of their relationship: 'It's just part of life's rich tapestry if you have been married to somebody,' the Sunday Times reported. He added: 'I just see it as illogical not to be a friend at the end of the day, regardless of what your circumstances are.' The Duke and Duchess of York have made no secret of their amicability since their split and are said to describe themselves as 'the world's happiest unmarried couple'. The Duchess, 54, who still lives at the Duke of York's home in Windsor, even visited the Queen's estate in Balmoral, Scotland for a break earlier this summer. It is believed the Duke's TV interview is a bid to improve his image worldwide after his acquaintance with convicted American paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The couple married in 1986 (left) but divorced a decade later - however they have since remained close friends . Andrew reportedly said of the scandal that he accepted he had to 'live with the rough and live with the smooth' in a 'free world, with freedom of speech'. He also used the interview to promote his iDEA scheme, which aims to improve young people's computer and digital skills to help them get a job. The technology-loving Duke is promoting the scheme with pop star Will.i.am and the pair are said to 'compare smartphones' when they meet up. But Will.i.am's phone caused embarrassment in a recent interview about the scheme, when it went off as the pair were answering questions on live TV. After the incident, the Prince told the Black Eyed Peas frontman: 'I leave my digital devices in the car when I am doing engagements - based on the fact that they might accidentally go off.' Talking about the scheme in his latest interview, Andrew said: 'I believe that the next generation are as capable and have greater opportunities than our generation ever had. 'So it's about making those possibilities more relevant and more alive to young people today.' The Duke used the interview to speak about a new scheme he is fronting with pop star Will.i.am (right), which helps young people gain skills in computing .","Royal couple divorced after decade of marriage in 1996 - but stayed friends .

A four-year-old boy suffers from a rare condition that means a scrape or an argument could kill him, his parents say. Four-year-old Morgan Taylor has adrenal insufficiency which means he cannot naturally deal with physical or emotional setbacks. The youngster’s body does not produce the stress hormone cortisol, and so his body will begin to shut down if he is not administered a life-saving injection within 30 minutes of any stressful event. Morgan Taylor, four, has adrenal insufficiency which means his body doesn't produce the stress hormone cortisol. As a result, without a life-saving cortisol injection after stressful events, his body would shut down . After Morgan started school in Burnley his mother, Susan Murwald, 39, said: ‘Every day I watch the clock, waiting for him to come home. ‘I miss him and it’s hard because I worry about anything happening. ‘He should be my responsibility, but I have to let him be a normal little boy and go to school.’ Morgan was diagnosed with the condition after being born by emergency caesarean at 28 weeks, weighing just 1lb 8oz. Morgan (pictured with his mother, Susan) was born at 28 weeks weighing just 1lb 8oz. When he was a week old he developed an infection and his parents were told he would not survive . Morgan (pictured with his mother, Susan, father, Neil, sister Abbey, 14, and brother, Ollie, 18-months) also has growth problems, chronic lung disease, a heart defect and behavioural problems . When he was a week old, he contracted . an infection in his bowel and Susan, and his father Neil, were told to . expect the worse by doctors who said he was not strong enough to . survive. The adrenal glands, which are found at the top of the kidneys, produce steroid hormones that are essential for life - cortisol and aldosterone. Cortisol mobilises nutrients, enables the body to fight inflammation, stimulates the liver to produce blood sugar and helps control the amount of water in the body. Adrenal insufficiency is caused by the failure of the adrenal glands to produce sufficient (or any) cortisol. A prolonged lack of the hormone causes severe fatigue, depression, loss of appetite and weight loss. Cortisol is particularly important when the body is subjected to stress, such as surgery, trauma or a serious infection. If the adrenal glands do not produce cortisol, the body might not be able to cope with this kind of major stress. This causes a life-threatening condition called adrenal crisis which causes symptoms including low blood pressure, stomach pain, nausea and fever. There are a number of potential causes for adrenal insufficiency including an infection, an autoimmune disease and pituitary gland tumours. Ms Murwald, a . mother-of-five, said: ‘We knew we were having a small baby, but we . didn’t know there was anything medically wrong with Morgan until he was . born. ‘They sent us home for the night to be with our other children and said they would call as soon as he started to deteriorate. ‘It was so upsetting to be told our baby wasn’t going to last the night. ‘We had only had him a week and I hadn’t even been able to give him a cuddle.’ But amazingly, the call never came and the couple returned to the hospital the following morning to learn that their little boy was pulling through. ‘It was a massive turning point for Morgan,’ Ms Murwald said. However, Morgan has be left with adrenal insufficiency which makes him vulnerable to physical and mental stress. Other symptoms of the condition include fatigue and muscle weakness, dizziness, nausea, loss of appetite and stomach ache. Mr . Taylor, a 37-year-old engineer, said: ‘If you or I fall over, our body . will deal with the stress of that situation, but Morgan’s body can’t do . that. ‘Even if he had an argument with someone, he wouldn’t be able to sit down and calm himself down. He’s just not capable. ‘Any . kind of shock to the system, physically or emotionally, means he needs a . cortisol injection as his body won’t naturally release it. Morgan has just started school but because of his condition is cannot play with the other children in the playground in case he becomes stressed . Morgan (pictured at school with Grace Naylor, four) is still small for his age and his parents do not know what the future holds for him . ‘If he doesn’t get the injection, his . body will start to shut down and he becomes clammy, lethargic and run . down and he would eventually die. ‘We have to take his kit wherever we go as just a trip to the park or the shops can be dangerous.’ Ms . Murwald has stayed at home to look after Morgan, who also has growth . problems, chronic lung disease, a heart defect and behavioural problems. Ms Murwald said: 'We knew we were having a small baby, but we didn't know there was anything medically wrong with Morgan until he was born.' Morgan is pictured in hospital shortly after his birth . All of the staff at Morgan's school are trained to administer his cortisol injections if he needs them . She said: ‘I worry about him and he’s in a class with other children who are much bigger than him. He has to really think about what he’s doing. ‘He knows all about his condition and he knows what the injections are for. ‘He’s aware that he has to be cautious and knows he’s not allowed to play contact sports. We have had to drill it into him.’ Ms Murwald said: 'I worry about him and he's in a class with other children who are much bigger than him. He has to really think about what he's doing' All of the staff on the school premises are trained to administer cortisol injections to Morgan if he needs them. ‘I feel more comfortable because of that,’ said Ms Murwald. ‘All the staff came forward to be trained which is nice because they didn’t have to. ‘But I can’t help but worry that everything will be OK as he has complex medical needs, just like any parent would. Ms Murwald said: 'He's very happy and incredibly cheeky, and although he's got this illness we just have to deal with it. It's heart breaking really because he's always got a smile on his face no matter what. We don't know what the future holds for him but while he's happy that's all we can ask for' ‘He’s very happy and incredibly cheeky, and although he’s got this illness we just have to deal with it. ‘It’s heart breaking really because he’s always got a smile on his face no matter what. ‘We don’t know what the future holds for him but while he’s happy that’s all we can ask for.’","Morgan Taylor, 4, has adrenal insufficiency which means his body doesn't produce the hormone cortisol, so he cannot deal with stress .

A hospital has sparked outrage by announcing it is to erect a smoking shelter outside a cancer ward. Managers at the new £400 million University Hospital of North Staffordshire have applied for planning permission for five shelters on site after patients repeatedly ignored the no-smoking policy. They will be put up outside the hospital's maternity block, two main entrances and its accident and emergency unit. Bosses at the new £400 million University Hospital of North Staffordshire have applied for planning permission for five smoking shelters on site . But the final shelter is to be installed outside the hospital's cancer ward - a move which has infuriated victims of the disease and charities. Cancer survivor Harry Larkins, 70, from Cheadle, Staffs., who still has annual check-ups after beating the disease in 2009, yesterday (Wed) slammed the decision. He said: 'I know they have to accommodate smokers, but a lot of people in the cancer ward have smoked throughout their lives and don't need reminding that could be the reason they are there. 'It's just plain insensitive. It is a huge site and they could put them somewhere a lot more discreet. I think it's a terrible error of judgement.' Ron Locker, founder of the Staffordshire Moorlands Cancer Support Group, said: 'I understand the difficulty of people who have been smoking all their lives to just quit. The move was taken after ents repeatedly ignored the hospital's no-smoking policy (posed by model) 'But it is not pleasant for patients heading into hospital to have to walk through people smoking outside.' Councillor Colin Eastwood, chairman of Newcastle Borough Council's Health Scrutiny Committee, said: 'I don't feel the shelters are really addressing the problem of smoking. It is almost like condoning smoking. 'Smoking is a real issue in the local area and it concerns me that the hospital is providing for them. 'What they should be doing is supporting smokers who are admitted to hospital to quit the habit.' Hospital officials yesterday refused to explain why a smoking shelter was planned for the cancer centre. Chief Nurse Liz Rix said: 'We do not condone smoking on our premises by patients, visitors or staff. 'However, a degree of pragmatism has been adopted to keep the hospital clean and tidy and smokers away from building entrances. 'The beautiful main entrance has become a particular problem area with a large number of smokers congregating and at times it has been difficult to keep the area clean. 'We accept this has caused problems for neighbouring residential areas and are working with unions to see what actions can be taken to alleviate this. 'We enforce a blanket ban on staff smoking on our property and staff will not be allowed to use the shelters.'

fff8c4836275d6079178a62d1badbaae8a6b0e07,"(CNN) -- Lane Kommer should be skiing this week. Instead he postponed a trip to Colorado because the snow situation just isn't looking good. ""We've been keeping a close eye on the weather the last few weeks and keeping our fingers crossed, hoping for some good snow and it just got to the point where we decided it's better to reschedule and pay to change our plans than to go out there and be disappointed,"" said Kommer, who was planning to fly from Dallas to meet up with friends at Beaver Creek Resort. Now they're planning to go in February. It is a decision faced by skiers and snowboarders across the United States as ski resorts scramble to make the snow that Mother Nature isn't providing. December 2011 yielded the 11th least extensive snow cover in the United States in the past 46 years, according to climatologist David Robinson, a professor in the geography department at Rutgers University. Weather patterns are moving in and out too quickly and nothing is locking in to produce significant snowfall, he said. ""It doesn't look like there's going to be huge improvement the next two weeks and we're getting halfway through winter by then. But still, hope springs eternal for late January into early March. One would expect that we're going to see at least some interruption in this progressive fast-moving pattern,"" Robinson said. Any snow would be a welcome change for the Lake Tahoe area straddling California and Nevada, where odd spring-like weather has plagued snow seekers. Base snow averaged about 14 inches at seven area resorts on Thursday, with summit averages of a little more than 19 inches. The annual average summit snowfall at one of the resorts is 350 inches. Revenue at some California resorts over the peak week between Christmas and New Year's was down 20% to 30% after a tremendous ski season across the United States last year, according to estimates from the National Ski Areas Association. It's no good for skiers, but the warm weather is pleasant, said local restaurant manager Vicky Mallett. ""It's just gorgeous. People are paddle-boarding and hiking and riding their bikes, so they're definitely in town hanging out,"" said Mallett, who manages the Fire Sign CafÃ© in Tahoe City, California. Lack of the cold white stuff actually brought a boost to the cafÃ©'s business in the past few weeks, she said. ""We're really busy because (visitors are) not skiing."" People who would usually be on the trails all day are skiing in the morning and then coming into town, Mallett said, but she suspects the novelty of the warm weather will wear off for vacationers. Ski resorts in other parts of the West didn't experience such steep declines in December business. In Colorado and Utah, revenue was down by single digit percentages over the holiday week, said Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association. Holiday bookings at major destination resorts are usually made before the start of the season. With the lack of snow going into January, some potential customers are hanging back to see what happens, Berry said. ""We are a weather-dependent industry, no matter what, and we've done lots of things to help mitigate it, but at the end of the day, it's always nice to have Mother Nature's help,"" he said. Some of Colorado's biggest resorts -- like Aspen and Vail -- are surviving on high altitude, cold temperatures and enough money to produce a lot of man-made snow, said Patrick Crawford, content director of snow sports website OnTheSnow. Ski areas are trying to make the best of it. Aspen/Snowmass CEO Mike Kaplan penned a blog post this week titled ""The Glass is Half Full"" highlighting some of the best trail conditions, and a Facebook comment complaining about attractive photos of ""fake snow"" on the resort's page received this upbeat response: ""Yep - sometimes we've got to lend a hand when Mother Nature is being fickle. Sure beats doing nothing, right?"" Vail Resorts, which owns six resorts in Colorado and California, is looking at a .6% increase in total lift ticket revenue from the start of the season in November through the beginning of January over the same period last year, according to CEO Rob Katz. Katz said that slight uptick after last year's incredible season is due in large part to the company's investment in snowmaking and family-friendly activities and amenities. So while a lot of expert terrain is closed, the intermediate terrain is available to vacationing families. ""For an expert skier who wants to ski everything, no question, they come and they say 'hey, this isn't as good as it was last year,' absolutely,"" Katz said. Despite a very slow start to the ski season, there are a few brighter spots, Crawford said. Western storm systems have split to the far north and south of the country, so conditions in New Mexico, Arizona and southern Colorado in the south and the Pacific Northwest, Alaska and Canada are looking pretty good. ""We can't complain certainly,"" said Kathleen Goyette, a spokeswoman for Ski Washington. Resorts in Washington got 20 to 35 inches of fresh snow during the last week of December. The state's resorts are aware of their luck compared with many other areas of the country, she said. ""We've been there before,"" Goyette said. ""We've been the ones with no snow."" Not so compassionate is Big Sky Resort in Montana, which is taking a run at Vail Resorts' business with an offer of free lift tickets to holders of the company's Epic Pass, which allows unlimited access to all six Vail-owned resorts in Colorado and California. Epic Pass holders must book lodging through Big Sky to be eligible for free skiing. Still, there's no bounty of deals, and the OnTheSnow user community isn't happy paying full price for poor conditions, Crawford said. ""Considering the state of the snow, you don't see as many discounts as you think you might. But this is also when (resorts) make all their money."" Things have ""turned the corner"" at ski areas east of the Mississippi after a 10% to 15% slump in holiday week revenue, said Berry of the National Ski Areas Association. There has been some natural snow in some areas this week and colder temperatures mean resorts are ""making snow like crazy."" People in the ski business have their fingers crossed for recovery across the country. Lack of snow affects livelihoods as well as vacation plans. ""It's a big big deal for our little industry,"" Crawford said.","Ski resorts have suffered from dry weather and warm temperatures .
Base snow averaged about 14 inches this week at Lake Tahoe resorts .
Bright spots include New Mexico, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska ."

Jockey Zac Purton made an emotional statement about the Caulfield Cup winner's sudden death to the TVN Racing Network. 'He gave me a great thrill at  Caulfield, for this to happen to him, it's not fair,' Mr Purton said. Animal rights activists have seized on the opportunity to question the ethics of horse racing.

Verema was euthanised after it broke its leg in the 2013 Cup. Another horse, the outsider Araldo, was transported to University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital for treatment after he injured his right hind leg after the race. Elio Celotto, the campaign director for the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, blamed the racing industry for treating the animals poorly. 'If these were human athletes, the sport would be banned,' Mr Celotto told Daily Mail Australia. In a statement, the RSCPA said horses were dying for our entertainment. 'This is a tragic outcome for both horses and we expect there to be a full and transparent investigation undertaken into both incidents. 'Events like these are a stark reminder to the community of the real risks to horses associated with racing.' 'Sadly, injury and death are the price some horses pay for our entertainment in a sport that puts intense pressure on animals to perform to the limits of their endurance. Verema, ridden by Christophe Lemaire (green silk), died following last year's Melbourne Cup (pictured) after it snapped its cannon bone around the 200m mark . Racing Victoria's (RV) Head of Veterinary and Equine Welfare, Dr Brian Stewart, said: . 'It is with sadness that we confirm that Admire Rakti has passed away in his stall following the running of the Emirates Melbourne Cup. 'The exact cause of death is yet to be determined, although the circumstances of the horse's passing are very rare. 'A post mortem will be conducted at the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital as is standard practice. 'Our sympathies are extended at this time to the owner Mr Kondo, trainer Mr Umeda and his staff who cared deeply for their horse and are naturally saddened by their tragic loss.' Dr Stewart also advised that the Mike Moroney-trained Araldo suffered an injury to its right hind leg when it took fright upon returning to scale and kicked the fence. The horse has been treated by the on-course veterinary team and has been transported by ambulance to the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital for further treatment and assessment. Protectionist took out this year's Melbourne Cup, with crowd favourite Admire Rakti finishing last . Claire Fryer, a spokeswoman for PETA Australia, told Daily Mail Australia: 'People who care about horses should steer clear of horse racing.' Ms Fryer said horses routinely sustain catastrophic injuries or drop dead on the track. Animal rights group Voiceless tweeted: 'The story of Admire Rakti exemplifies everything that is wrong with the horse racing industry.' Dr Brian Stewart, the head of Veterinary and Equine Welfare at Racing Victoria, said the exact cause of Admire Rakti's death was yet to be determined. 'It is with sadness that we confirm that Admire Rakti has passed away in his stall following the running of the Emirates Melbourne Cup,' Dr Stewart said. The Victorian Racing Club led the tributes to Admire Rakti on Twitter, saying it 'expresses its condolences to connections of (the horse) following his passing'. Admire Rakti took out the Caulfield Cup in what was described as 'brilliant style' last month, and many Twitter users paid tributes to the horse's racing prowess. The Toodyay Race Course organisation, in WA, tweeted: 'RIP Admire Rakti - what a wonderful horse may he rest in peace.' Businessman Scott O'Neill wrote: '#AdmireRakti rip mate.

A mother who created false alibis for her murdering son and his friend has been imprisoned for two years. Maria Keane, 37, told police her then 16-year-old son George Keane and his friend Luke Garner had been watching DVDs at her house on the night of December 23. But her lie was exposed when other evidence was uncovered that led the pair to be convicted of the murder of David Scott on the same evening. Alibi: Maria Keane, left, gave a false witness statement to her police saying her son George, right, was watching DVDs at home when in fact he was involved in a murder . The teenagers were jailed indefinitely last month and Maria Keane has received a two-year prison sentence for perverting the course of justice after she gave a false witness statement. Mr Scott, a father-of-two, was repeatedly stabbed by the killers in Stanley, County Durham. Stabbed: David Scott, the father-of-two who was killed by the two youths before Christmas last year . Garner was arrested five days later and in police interviews said he had been at Maria Keane's home. When police checked out the story, Maria Keane told police her son and his friend had been with her watching TV at her house that night and had stayed there until noon the next day. When further evidence came to light George Keane was arrested on December 31 - and repeated his claim. But CCTV showed him away from the house and a witness said he had confessed what had really happened. Sentencing her at Newcastle Crown . Court, Judge James Goss QC said: 'With you they concocted a false alibi . where it was agreed you would all say George Keane and Luke Garner were . in your house and in your company in the period when they were in fact . involved in killing David Scott. 'You gave a witness statement which gave them a cast iron alibi and they gave the same account. 'This . was deliberate lying to deflect possible blame for a crime of homicide . and the seriousness of this type of offence merits a custodial . sentence.' Maria Keane was arrested on January 4 for perverting the course of justice. After her arrest Maria Keane changed her story to try to fit in with other evidence the police had gathered. Accomplice: Luke Garner, who was also convicted of the murder, was jailed along with George Keane . The mother-of-seven - who is currently pregnant with her eighth chid - has two previous convictions for child neglect from 2003 and 2005 and one for animal cruelty in 2011. The court heard George was not living with her at the time and had been in care. Maria Keane pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. Peter Sabiston, defending, said: 'It was a moral dilemma with it being her son and a really serious allegation. 'She is poorly equipped to deal with the traumas in her life. 'She has seven children and is expecting another child.' David Scott sustained five stab wounds to his upper body, four to his back and one to the right front side of his abdomen, in the attack just after 1am the day before Christmas Eve last year. One of the stab wounds to his back penetrated a lung, causing internal bleeding into his chest cavity and effectively suffocating him. Keane and Garner, both now 17, were given indefinite sentences.

Most couples who renew their wedding vows do so several years after they first step down the aisle. But Gemma and Luke Stewart are not a couple with time on their side. Their vow renewal on a beautiful Corfu beach last October, just a year after they first married, was a symbol of just how much time they might have left together. For Gemma, 30, has been told she may have just three months to live, after being diagnosed with terminal malignant melanoma. Gemma Stewart says being told she had terminal cancer made her realise boyfriend Luke (pictured) was the love of her life. The couple married in October 2011 . But while she is clearly devastated at her diagnosis, she also believes it has made the last few months of her life some of the best. Put simply, she says: ‘Being told I had terminal cancer made me realise Luke was the love of my life.‘Suddenly everything becomes very clear and you realise exactly what it is you want.’ Until then, the couple, who have been together for eight years, had been unsure of their future. As Gemma explains: ‘We always loved each other but it just didn’t work the first couple of times we lived together. I am quite bohemian and a hoarder of stuff and Luke is the total opposite. We also had different outlooks on life, to some degree. The couple enjoyed a 30's Hollywood glam-style themed wedding. Until her diagnosis, they had been unsure of their future . ‘I was also badly affected by the death of my father at the beginning of 2009 as he was the person who basically brought me up and we were extremely close. 'Being told I had terminal cancer made me realise Luke was the love of my life' ‘After that, I had a burning desire to have children to continue Dad’s blood line. But Luke wasn’t ready to have a family and that caused a huge rift between us. ‘In hindsight, it really wasn’t the right time to go about it, as I was incredibly raw. ‘Now we’ve made it work because we’ve realised how much we love each other.’ The couple, who live in Farnborough, Hampshire, met in April 2005 in a nightclub. ‘It was a very cheesy nightclub and we both stood out like sore thumbs,’ Gemma told MailOnline.  ‘We’d both been dragged along by the groups of friends we were with. But we got talking and just clicked. He took my number and we went on a date shortly afterwards.’ Over the next few years they had a couple of minor breakups, but always remained friends. And they were back together when in October 2010, Gemma found a lump near her groin. ‘I spoke with Luke and he encouraged me to go see a doctor,’ she recalls. ‘Neither of us dreamed it could be cancer. Shock diagnosis: Very fair skinned, Gemma has never been a tanner and was always careful in the sun . 'My doctor agreed - I was too young and had lived a healthy lifestyle, so he was sure it was nothing sinister. But as a precaution, he decided to run a few tests.' 'I just couldn't believe what I was hearing... it was like being smacked around the face' She began to feel uneasy when she was called in for a biopsy – and rightly so, for the news that followed was shattering. The biopsy had revealed malignant melanoma in her lymph nodes. ‘It was such a shock as I have never been a tanner – I just couldn’t believe what I was hearing,’ she  says ‘It was like being smacked around the face. ‘My mind was whirring with questions – when had it started, how had I got it when I’d always been so careful in the sun?’ Doctors told her the primary site of the melanoma was in the middle of the ball of her foot. ‘Looking back, I had felt very run down, but I put that down to my busy job as a special needs teacher working with autistic children, commuting and the stress of Dad dying,' she says. ‘I was warned from the start that it wasn’t good. I was pretty much slap bang in the middle of stage three, advanced cancer and was already very ill.’ The couple renewed their vows in Corfu last October, just a year after they first married. Gemma's blue wig is to symbolise the Greek theme . Gemma immediately underwent major surgery at the Royal Marsden to remove 37 lymph nodes, before undergoing chemotherapy. 'I am so grateful for every day we have together' But that failed to stop the cancer spreading and just seven months later, in May 2011, she received the devastating news that the cancer was terminal. ‘When I heard the news, all I could think about was Luke,’ she recalls. ‘We’d broken up again in the January but now everything seemed so clear, and I had to be with him. ‘He was at work and I couldn't bear to tell him over the phone. I waited for him to come around to my house and when I told him my prognosis we hugged and cried and told each other how much we loved each other. ‘It was then that I realised that the man in front of me really was the love of my life and before I knew it, I was telling him I wanted to marry him. He felt the same and proposed then and there. ‘Suddenly, everything became very clear and I no longer cared about anything in the past or the silly rows we’d had. ‘I knew regardless of what happened Luke would always be there for me. He was my rock, the one person who could cheer me up no matter what. Gemma says: 'When I do pass away I will be happy because in Luke I have found the love of my life and nothing else matters. I am so grateful for every day we have together' Precious moments: Gemma and Luke, seen on a boat trip, met in a nightclub in April 2005 . ‘I just knew that I wanted to marry him, have a fabulous day celebrating our love and enjoying the time we had left together.’ Not knowing how long she he had left, Gemma set about planning her 30’s Hollywood glam-style wedding. And in October 2011 she and Luke, 36, who works for a luxury mobile phone company, married in front of their friends and family in a Farnborough boutique hotel. ‘It was the best day of my life and I couldn't have been happier,’ says Gemma. ‘It wasn’t about getting a piece of paper, it was about celebrating our love with friends.' Brave: Gemma hopes her story will serve as a cautionary tale to those striving to get a sun tan . Since her diagnosis, Gemma has also thrown herself into travelling the world, visiting destinations such as the Mauritius, Australia and New York and the Caribbean. And in October, the couple celebrated their first anniversary by having a blessing in Corfu – the destination of their first holiday. Having lost her hair due to radiotherapy on her brain, after tumours were also discovered there, Gemma decided to embrace the Greek theme and wear a blue wig. ‘I just thought “if I’m going to wear a wig, why not wear a fabulous blue one and do the Grecian look”.' She has chosen to share her story now to try and prevent others suffering a similar fate. ‘I just want to make sure people don’t get to my stage. I have always been fair skinned and never a tanner, but I must have been burnt on my foot at some stage and that’s what triggered the cancer, although I have no recollection of it. ‘I was always very careful, wearing factor 30. So look after yourself and don’t sacrifice your life for a tan. I can’t stress enough how much it’s not worth it.’ She is now planning her 31st birthday in March as her next milestone to reach, and something to focus on. ‘But I know that if I do pass away I will be happy because in Luke I have found the love of my life and nothing else matters. I am so grateful for every day we have together.’ January 21- 27 is Macmillan Cancer Support’s Cancer Talk Week.

fff95a57a982743cc4752dc154a8f7ba701304a5,"By . Stephanie Linning . A reclusive pensioner died surrounded by a huge pile of rubbish that he had been hoarding - and his body was not found until police broke down his door eight months later. Denis Walsby, 74, who had not had contact with his family for years, was found lying underneath a stack of papers at the foot of his stairs, with bags of rubbish and cardboard boxes packed in around him. The police officer who uncovered the decomposing body described the scene as being 'like a nest' where Mr Walsby had collected, and kept, everything that he needed. Hoarder: Plastic bags and cardboard boxes filled with junk were stacked so high in Denis Walsby's house that the police officer who discovered his body found it difficult to open the front door . During the inquest at Southampton Coroners' Court, it emerged that Mr Walsby was living downstairs among the clutter in his terraced house in Romsey, Hampshire during the final months of his life. Dates on the piles of mail found in his home indicated that Mr . Walsby could have died in April last year - eight months before he was found dead - the court heard. The alarm was raised when a postman saw mail piled up inside the porch at his home in Romsey, Hampshire. PC Lindsay Miell, who found Mr Walsby's body, noticed an infestation of flies upon entering the property. She said: 'It was hugely cluttered to the point that I couldn’t step inside the doorway. 'The thing that immediately struck me was the smell. It appeared in the last stages of his life that he had created a small nest for himself - it was where he had basically done everything.' Reclusive: Denis Walsby, pictured in 1968. He did not have any contact with his family for years before he died, according to his ex-wife . Mr Walsby had not had contact with any family for years and had not been in touch with his ex-wife Joyce, 69, for 30 years. Joyce, from Southampton, said they had moved to the then new-build home in 1970 when they were both working for Ordnance Survey. The couple divorced in 1982 and his ex-wife said that she had not spoken to Mr Walsby since he retired in 1984. It was only after Mr Walsby died that she met his cousin, Robert Lucas, who it appears is his last surviving relative. Mr Walsby would holiday in Germany and would visit Mr Lucas at his home in Camberley, Surrey, on his way home. He was last seen at a family funeral in 2001 and Mr Lucas last spoke to him in 2006. Little is known about the last ten years of his life. Richard Heather, of Hampshire taxi firm Samtax, took Mr Walsby on weekly shopping trips. He said: 'He never used to complain about his health.' Mr Walsby’s neighbour, Karen Stewart, also said she had knocked on his front door several times each year. She said would only see him once every few months and could have been the last person to have spoken to him. She said: 'I felt so awful when I heard that he’d died, I was in tears.' A post-mortem found that Mr Walsby had died from a head injury although it is uncertain how he sustained it. Delivering a verdict of accidental death, Central Hampshire coroner Grahame Short said: 'Because of the period of time which has elapsed, it’s not possible to ascertain whether he had been drinking, for example, and then fallen, or if he had a fall because he tripped. 'He was clearly a very reclusive man who preferred his own company.'","Denis Walsby was found underneath stack of papers, surrounded by rubbish .

""We had many more competitive applications than money to fund them in this round,"" Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Tuesday. ""Race to the Top"" is an Obama administration initiative to award money to states that show that they have a plan for school reforms in four main areas: turning around low performing schools, adopting college and career ready standards, effective teachers and principals, and using data systems to support student achievement. Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia applied for the second round of competition, and of those, 19 were listed as finalists by the Department of Education in July. Those finalists all sent representatives to Washington in August to present their case to a group of peer reviewers. Massachusetts received the highest score in the second round of competition followed by New York and Hawaii. Sometimes, it's just about finishing the test. In the first phase of the competition, Hawaii turned in an incomplete application.  In the second phase, not only did they turn in a completed application, but they were awarded with a grant of $75 million. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist thanked the teachers' unions for their success.  In that state, 54 local teacher unions signed on to their plans. ""This level of participation far exceeds the five local teacher unions who joined our efforts during Phase 1,"" he said in a statement. Tennessee and Delaware both won grants under the program in the first round which was announced earlier this year. Over the next four years, Tennessee will receive $400 million and Delaware will receive $100 million for their programs. For the second round, the Department of Education announced that it would be limiting the amount that any given state can receive. The limits are based on the student population of that state. So, large states like New York and Florida can receive as much as $700 million while smaller states like Hawaii, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia are limited to $75 million grants. The grants will be awarded in installments over the next four years.  And state education departments need to spend the money according to the plans they submitted.  In a conference call with reporters, Duncan said he would pull funding from states that he feels are not ""acting in good faith."" Duncan said he hopes Tuesday's announcement is not the end of the program. ""We're very hopeful there will be a Phase 3 of 'Race to the Top' and have requested $1.35 billion dollars in next year's budget,"" he said.","Nine states plus the District of Columbia are winners .

fffa5b51768e8689c470e64bb4bfb039ccc1eaf9,"Blaze: A teenage work experience girl set fire to the wilko store in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, because she was 'a bit bored' A teenage private schoolgirl who was 'fed up' of her work experience in a shop set fire to it, causing £1million damage, a court heard. The girl, 15, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was working in a wilko shop, formerly known as Wilkinson's, in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, on placement from her fee-paying private school when she started the blaze with a cigarette lighter. Staff and customers had to be evacuated as thick black smoke filled the shop as the fire, which began in a cage in a warehouse behind the shop, swept the premises. Warwick Crown Court heard the 'intelligent student' set fire to waste cardboard in a cage in the goods inward bay as she was fed up of stacking shelves and wanted to go home for the day. Fire crews were called after the blaze got out of control, and spent more than half an hour battling to quench the fire which began at around 12.20pm on July 8 this year. The girl was arrested by police shortly afterwards, and admitted to officers it was a 'stupid thing to do.' Ninda Gill, prosecuting, said: 'The incident occurred at lunchtime when the store was busy with customers, and elderly customers were caused distress. 'The potential for injury to staff and customers was great as the store was consumed by smoke.' Miss Gill added that, as a result of the blaze, the hardware chain was now reviewing its national policy in relation to taking on any more work experience students. She said: 'It has caused a national employer not to engage in work experience schemes.' CCTV footage played in court showed the teenager leaning into a cage of waste cardboard in the goods inbound bay. Smoke began to rise one minute later and, as she left the bay, flames began flickering, which quickly turned into an inferno. Fire investigators rated the danger to life at eight on a scale of one to ten, although the building was evacuated without anyone being injured. The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, hoped to start a small fire that would get her sent home . Fire crews were called and it took more than half an hour to extinguish the flames at the homeware store . The blaze was tackled by five fire crews using breathing apparatus and a 'conservative estimate' has been put on the damage caused at between £600,000 and £1 million. John Mohammed, defending, said: 'To a degree she got a bit bored, and she would have liked to have done something more exciting than stocking shelves. 'When she went to the goods inward area she intended to start what she thought would be a small fire in a crate, as she described it, which contained cardboard boxes. 'She lit the corner of a box, and did not expect it to spread any further than the cage it was in.  She thought it would cause some disruption, sufficient for her to be able to go home.' He added: 'She didn't realise how quickly the fire would spread to other boxes - she certainly did not intend to harm anyone.' Shoppers and staff had to be evacuated at fire swept through the store at lunchtime, filling it with black smoke . Mr Mohammed said the girl came from a good family, and her parents were 'aghast' at what she did. He said she bitterly regrets what she did, and she had written a letter of apology to Wilkinson. The teenager herself said: 'When I was doing it I didn't think of the consequences - it was a stupid act. If I could turn the clock back, I would.' The girl, who admitted arson with intent to cause damage and being reckless as to whether lives were endangered, was due to be sentenced this week. But Judge Alan Parker ordered for her to be examined by a psychiatrist first, saying: 'I am very concerned about her, and very concerned about the dissociation referred to. 'The fact that she is an intelligent girl makes it more disturbing.'","Teenager, who cannot be named, was on placement from fee-paying school .

fffaf50d60eb097e3909ac9c702cb9c8b865615e,"(CNN) -- In the old days, being passive-aggressive took effort. An annoyance -- like, say, a neighbor who has elected to make the stairwell his own personal broom closet -- would fester and fester until one was finally forced into action. IE, leaving a note to the effect of: ""Hi! I tripped over a bucket of liquid in the hallway and turned my ankle. Therefore, I elected to remove your garbage from our common area -- for the sake of everyone's safety. Thanks! :D 3B. P.S. Everyone can hear you have sex through the wall."" Now, it's all too easy to vent your frustrations via Twitter, Facebook and various and sundry meme machines, cluttering the newsfeeds of friends and ""Facebook friends"" with your petty, petty gripes. We get it: Sometimes you just need to scream silently into your pillow, and since one does not always have a pillow on hand (unless one rolls like that), the Web is often the closest substitute. Still, it is vital to realize that you are not, in fact, bellowing into the ether about your co-worker's apparent lack of breathing-through-the-nose skills -- no, you are recording these grievances for all to see, laugh at and possibly garner a book deal via passive-aggressive notes. Thankfully, the Web (and its outlying regions) is an innovative place, and now it's possible to get passive-aggressive (and even outright aggressive) without spreading your lack of sunshine to the rest of your social network. Here's what to do: . When your friends are being all foe-like . The other weekend, you had a rather unfortunate drunken experience with a fire extinguisher at a local music venue. The next day, you confided in your friend -- let's call him ""Steve"" -- who immediately appropriated the venue's security camera footage and posted your incriminating, foamy dance (you were belting out a stirring rendition of ""We Didn't Start the Fire,"" you now recall) to YouTube. You became a viral star! -- for all the wrong reasons. Angrily, you take to Facebook and start posting messages akin to, ""NOW I KNOW WHO MY REAL FRIENDS ARE!"" Sorry to break it to you, dude, but acting out digitally in this way makes you look like a giant loser -- not that you needed any help in the first place. Naturally, you should probably confront your friend, but if you can't manage to summon up the balls to do so, might we suggest downloading Face-Invaders, an iPad game that allows you to blast your Facebook friends in effigy as if they were malignant aliens from outer space. ""Steve"" will never know what hit him -- unless you manage to get your hands on another fire extinguisher. When your beau is being a schmo . So here's the thing. Everything about you and your girlfriend makes us intensely uncomfortable: the way you (wetly) make out in public, the way you lick sauce off of each other's face while eating, and, especially, the way you get into raging fights in public locations and then retreat into the nearest restroom to ""make up."" And when you port all of that over into the digital realm, snipping about fights and seeking support from your friends (""He's just not good enough for you, girl!"") we're just that much more embarrassed for you because it's all out there for anyone to see (Openbook is watching). Luckily, someone has gone and created an application called Pair especially for couples, allowing Jack and Jill to share pictures, videos, texts and drawings with each other -- and each other alone. So the next time you feel tempted to bring up Jack's inability to purchase TP via incensed tweet, snap a pic of the naked roll and send it along to J instead.

fffafbfcfd9d95f06f9459f16403fb89c1998675,"As the hours count down to $85 billion in government-wide spending cuts, there's one transportation service that won't be derailed -- Amtrak. Officials of the nation's only long-haul passenger railroad say there will be no cutbacks or changes in its schedule, especially on its popular Northeast Corridor route between Washington, New York and Boston. That's much different than the scenario facing U.S. airlines, which may be forced to alter schedules if federally run air traffic control services are disrupted by spending cuts due to take effect on Friday. Just how is Amtrak able to absorb a hit from the so-called budget sequester? Part of the answer lies in its charter as a for-profit government corporation, which allows it to operate like a business and charge fares and fees. ""Amtrak is planning to take actions to allow it to withstand a funding cut and not cut service. During (fiscal year) 2013, Amtrak is experiencing solid revenue growth and we have been controlling our costs and managing our budget in anticipation of a possible reduction in federal funding,"" said Kimberly Woods, an Amtrak spokeswoman. Congressmen leave as spending cuts loom . However, she acknowledged that the ""continued lack of predictable federal appropriations makes proper budgeting and future planning extremely difficult."" Rail service has been a priority for the Obama administration. While in the Senate, Vice President Joe Biden commuted for years to his home in Delaware on Amtrak and is one of its biggest supporters. The railroad has instituted a number of business reforms over the years, some of them under pressure from Congress, lowered debt, and has been able to make infrastructure improvements to boost operating efficiency. Amtrak carried more than 31 million passengers last year and covers most of its operating costs from passenger revenue. Why Washington can't cut wasteful spending . But it also receives taxpayer help each year. In fiscal year 2012, Amtrak was approved to receive an operating subsidy of $466 million. The remainder of government help for capital improvements and debt service was estimated at $950 million. If Amtrak is going to continue to stay on track, it will have to rely on its money-making short haul routes, where it competes with airlines. Nearly 90 percent of the rail service's ridership since 1997 has been on trips under 400 miles. Along with a 55 percent jump in passengers, it generated a positive operating surplus of $47 million in 2011, according to a new report released by the Brookings Institution. Amtrak has been the fastest-growing domestic transportation mode over the past 15 years, the report said. By the numbers: Congress and fiscal delays . Ten metropolitan areas, mostly on the coasts, account for nearly two-thirds of its ridership. Its signature line, the high-speed Acela, operates in the Northeast and is aimed at premium-paying business travelers. ""The Brookings report shows that Amtrak ridership has been growing faster than any other domestic mode of transportation, faster than GDP, and faster than population growth. These ridership numbers include our long-distance train passengers,"" Steve Kulm, Amtrak spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. Heavily subsidized long-haul routes have long been a target of criticism from Amtrak opponents, especially in Congress. What you need to know about spending cuts . The report on rail travel trends found ridership on long distance routes carry less than 20 percent of system riders and contributed a drag to Amtrak's bottom line to the tune of $614 million. ""We appreciate their suggestion to allow states the flexibility to use their federal surface transportation dollars for rail investments. With regard to how long-distance trains are funded, Congress has determined that these services are vital and a necessary part of America's national transportation system and economy,"" Kulm said. Robert Puentes, a Brookings senior fellow and co-author of the report, said that Amtrak is ""too often considered a big, bloated bureaucracy that depends heavily on federal subsidies and is no longer relevant to the technologically oriented metropolitan economies of today.""

Kristel Padasas was volunteering at a mass officiated by the Pope near Tacloban's airport today when a scaffolding reportedly holding huge speakers was blown over by strong winds. She suffered a fractured skull and was taken to St Paul's Hospital in Tacloban City, shortly after the leader of the Catholic church departed, where she was pronounced dead, according to reports. Kristel Padasas, 27, was killed when she was hit by a piece of scaffolding supporting huge speakers during Pope Francis's visit to the Philippines today . Vatican spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi said the Pope was informed of the woman's death after returning to Manila. He asked his aides 'to investigate how he could show his own suffering in solidarity with the (woman's) family', Mr Lombardi said. Ms Padasas, from Manila, was based in the Samar province of the island where she was working on a recovery project for typhoon Haiyan with charity, Catholic Relief Services (CRS).

Deceit: Dr Ellen MacInnes (pictured) was banned from the roads for drink-driving and used a sample of clean blood from her own patient in Essex to try to con testers that she was all clear . A family doctor has been found guilty of a ‘grave abuse of trust’ for taking blood from a patient and pretending it was her own in an attempt to beat a drink driving ban. Dr Ellen MacInnes, 46, claimed she was checking for an ‘underlying medical condition’ when she took a syringe of the female patient’s blood. But she instead submitted the vial as if it were her blood to medical experts working for licensing authority the DVLA – along with a forged signature from another doctor – in an effort to convince them she was sober after a string of drink driving convictions and a driving ban. A General Medical Council panel heard that the married mother of four had sent the ‘clean’ sample of blood with the forged signature in an unsuccessful attempt to deceive the DVLA and have her licence reinstated. The same day she had already submitted a genuine sample of her blood at the Whitley House Surgery in Chelmsford. Confronted with two samples of blood bearing her name – one ‘clean’ and one containing ‘abnormalities’ – on May 26 last year, staff testing it for the DVLA at the Broomfield Hospital Laboratory became suspicious. She was required to give another sample and admitted her deception during a further blood  test at the former Royal London  Homeopathic Hospital on August 17 last year. But as the doctor left the room, and the nurse washed her hands, Dr MacInnes snatched the blood vial and fled the hospital. In an apparent attempt to see if  her blood would come out clean  if tested, she sent a sample of it for analysis to the Baddow  Village Surgery in Chelmsford – where she once worked – using forms filled out with a former patient’s name. When her sample came back showing ‘abnormalities’ she accessed the surgery’s computer to wipe all traces of it. Dr MacInnes, of Chelmsford, was found guilty of three charges of  dishonesty by the GMC and suspended for 12 months for serious professional misconduct. GMC panel chairman Dr Surendra Kumar told Dr MacInnes: ‘The panel heard you took the blood from Ms A under the pretence it was to be tested to discover if she had an underlying illness. Dr MacInnes was formerly of the Baddow Village Surgery in Essex (pictured) but has been suspended for a year . ‘The panel took a grave view of your abusing her trust in you in such a way.’ He added: ‘Your dishonest actions have the potential to undermine the reputation of the profession as a whole.’ Dr MacInnes admitted the charges of dishonesty, but claimed they were ‘sudden irrational decisions’ – a view the GMC said was ‘not credible’. She was previously suspended by the GMC’s fitness to practise panel in 2009 for a period of six months following a spate of drink-related incidents. The previous misconduct hearing was told her brushes with the law began in 2004 when she was convicted of drink driving and disqualified at North West Essex Magistrates’ Court. In January 2006 a practice nurse smelt alcohol on the doctor’s breath ‘from some feet away’ while  she was fitting a contraceptive coil. She was fired later the same month after she appeared drunk and smelling of alcohol at a surgery meeting. A further drink driving conviction followed in 2007.","Suspended by the GMC in 2004, 2009 and in 2011 for working or driving under the influence of alcohol ."

'It tastes like cow poop!' said one young boy when tasting coffee from Brazil as part of the gustatory experiment from website KitchenBowl.com . Video of the American youngsters trying foods from Korea, Brazil, Finland, Vietnam, Poland and the Netherlands has nearly half a million views on YouTube since being posted yesterday. Korea: The American kids were less than thrilled when offered this Korean breakfast of anchovies, kimchee, and eggs though they dared to try it anyway . Gross!: This American kid grimaced as he tried the breakfast typically served to kids in Korea . The first breakfast the American children tried was from Korea and consisted of kimchee (pickled cabbage), anchovies, egg, and other spicy foods, . 'There's a dead fish in it,' said one of the boys as he proceeded trying the dish with caution. The others seemed to have a bit of trouble gulping down the savory tastes as well. When trying food from Brazil they were given coffee, ham, bread, and banana. 'I think it's weird that kids in Brazil drink coffee' said one of the American participants who was as shocked as 'cow poop' kid that the typically adult drink was an item on the menu. The children had no trouble munching on the banana part of the meal which may have been the most recognizable element on the breakfast table. You want me to drink what?: This American likened coffee as part of this Brazilian breakfast to 'cow poop' but didn't mind the bread, ham, and banana it was also served with . Next the adventurers were asked to try food from Finland which was characterized by a bowl of raspberries along with salmon and onion on a piece of bread. 'No I would not eat fish for breakfast,' said one girl who was presented with the common dish of Finland. 'This is pretty soft that could be my pillow,' said the spunky young boy of the bread, salmon, and onion creation. One of the American kids was fond of the meal but wasn't quite sure where it came from. 'I actually would eat this for breakfast,' he said. When asked where he thought the food might come from he replied, 'Africa.' I'd eat it: This kid said he liked the salmon, onion, bread and raspberry breakfast from Finland but guessed that the meal actually came from Africa . Another American girl who tried the fish breakfast had trouble placing a geographic origin. 'What's Finland,' she asked? 'A country in Europe,' replied one of the adults serving her the food. The young Americans were then served a very old egg called a Century Egg in a breakfast menu from Vietnam. 'So it kind of has liked a portable toilet smell and a rotten egg smell,' said one boy when describing the Vietnamese food. Vietnam: One American youngster said that the extremely old Centry Egg from Vietnam smelled like portable toilet and also rotten egg . Not pleased: This American child had trouble sniffing and stomaching this breakfast from Vietnam . 'This is really good,' said another. The egg, sausage, potato, and apple, breakfast from Poland proved to be a hit with the American kids. 'This tastes like French fries and French fries are good,' said one kid. The other kids stuffed their faces until they couldn't take eating any more food. Poland: This American's eyes were bigger than his stomach when he was served the Polish breakfast of eggs, sausage, apple, and potato . The final breakfast from the Netherlands which was Hagelslag (chocolate sprinkles) on toast, proved to be the biggest hit. 'I don't think my friends would eat this for breakfast because their mom's would say it would be too unhealthy,' said one child. 'This is great,' said another girl as she voraciously scarfed down the toast leaving chocolate smudges all over her face. While some of the foods may have differed from the egg and cereal breakfast common to American children, chocolate sprinkle toast may be popular with kids in America and many countries across the globe. Disbelief: This American said he didn't think he or his friends would be allowed to eat the chocolate dish at home for fear that it would be 'too unhealthy' Netherlands:: The kids unanimously enjoyed the Hagelsag (chocolate sprinkles) toast from the Netherlands and were sent into a chocolate stupor .","'It tastes like cow poop!' said one young boy when tasting coffee from Brazil as part of the gustatory experiment from website KitchenBowl.com .

Not having it: 89-year-old Moses Lake, Washington shop owner Miyo Koba stands in her store holding the 5 wood golf club she used to fend off a samurai sword wielding attacker who robbed her store on Sunday morning . Brave: The attacker came in demanding Miyo open the register. She refused and says she was emboldened by the false belief her attacker's 3-foot sword was just a toy . 'I had the scissors in my hand like this,' she said as she demonstrated her threatening stance to KREM. She said the robber demanded she open the register and that he at some point knocked her down. 'I didn't have the nerve to stab him,' admitted Koba, who nonetheless was under the false impression his sword was just a toy. 'I didn't feel threatened.  It just probably made me a little bit more brave,' she told KREM. While on the floor, the plucky lady snatched a nearby golf club and started swinging. Sharp lady: Koba first grabbed a pair of scissors, which she brandished at the robber but was hesitant to stab him. Instead, she grabbed a golf club--but not before he pushed her to the ground . Thwomp! Koba first swung at the robber's head, but missed. So she whacked him in the legs before he ran off with her cash register . 'I got into a sitting position and I found the club so I went tried to swing this club at him and I tried to hit his head a couple times but I couldn't reach it,' said Koba, who then went for his legs where she landed some blows. The wounded robber managed to make it out of the store with the cash register, which was recovered later by police along with the robbers clothing and shoes. Police say he was riding a BMX style bike as he fled. 'He must have been running around in his underwear and no shoes because that's what they said, they found all his clothes,' said Koba. Thankfully, Koba was unharmed and had her register returned by police.","Miyo Koba of Moses Lake, Washington was threatened with a samurai sword on Sunday by the first robber she faced in 60 years as a shop owner .

Rooney was the youngest player to represent England at the time, aged 17 years and 111 days, when he came on at halftime to win his first cap in a friendly against Australia at Upton Park on Feb. 12, 2003, beating a record that had stood since 1879. He became the youngest player to score for England seven months later in a 2-1 win over Macedonia in a Euro 2004 qualifier in Skopje on Septemner 6, 2003, aged 17 years 317 days. Although Theo Walcott eclipsed his youngest appearance record in 2006, Rooney's record as youngest scorer still stands. England's appearance record is held by Peter Shilton, the goalkeeper who was capped 125 times. David Beckham made a record 115 outfield appearances.

A racist thug who made a Nazi salute inside a packed pub and called black people c***s and n*****s was today jailed for almost two years and branded a ‘disgrace to the values of this country’. John Hennigan, 46, of Harlow, Essex, was caught on camera delivering the fascist gesture in front of shocked drinkers in February at The Magpie pub in Bishopsgate, central London. The antics put him in breach of an Asbo imposed in 2005 when a swastika was discovered daubed on the front door of his council house. It was the seventh time he had flouted the order. Racist: John Hennigan, 46, of Harlow, Essex, was caught on camera delivering the fascist gesture in front of shocked drinkers in February at The Magpie pub in Bishopsgate, central London . Hennigan claimed he had only been raising his arm to collect his change after paying for a drink, but was convicted by a majority verdict of 10-2 after a trial at the Old Bailey in central London. Sentencing Hennigan, Judge Nicholas Cooke QC told him the court was ‘not upholding some culture of political correctness’ but ‘preserving public order’ and dealing with unacceptable behavior. He added: ‘In this crowded public house in this city you gave a Nazi salute and spoke provocatively of Jews. The Holocaust was a crime against humanity of enormous magnitude. ‘Behaving in the way you did was appalling. You spoke of black people as c***s and n*****s. ‘The use of such terms is grossly offensive and conjures up memories of the slave trade, again a crime against humanity of enormous magnitude. Behaving in such a way was likewise appalling.’ The judge said Hennigan’s antics were also an affront to those who fought against the ‘racist evil of Nazism’ in the Second World War and ‘insults the memories of those who sacrificed themselves’. London pub: Hennigan had been barred from The Magpie in central London two times before but was spotted on CCTV by manager Paul MacAllion. 'He was making Nazi salutes at the bar,' the manager said . He added: ‘You see yourself as some sort of loyal nationalist or crusader against Communism. You are in fact a disgrace to the values of this country.’ Hennigan, who attended court wearing a T-shirt with an image of left-wing Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara with a line through it, told the judge ‘no probs’ as he was led away to the cells. 'You see yourself as some sort of loyal nationalist or crusader against Communism. You are in fact a disgrace to the values of this country' Judge Nicholas Cooke QC . The racist has 43 previous convictions for offences including drug and firearm possession and common assault. He was last before the courts for breaching his Asbo in 2010. That was after he launched racist abuse at a newsagent before attacking him with a sweet display. Hennigan had been barred from The Magpie two times before but was spotted on CCTV by manager Paul MacAllion. ‘He was making Nazi salutes at the bar,’ the manager said . ‘I was trying to make sure it was the same guy I had barred, staring at the CCTV, and three times I saw him do it. I went immediately down to the bar and confronted him.

Officials in a popular resort city in New Jersey are considering rules that would require visitors to pull up their pants, wear a shirt and don a pair of shoes while strolling the town's boardwalk. Wildwood, popular with holiday-makers from surrounding areas during the summer months, has a family-friendly appeal, and the city's officials want to keep it that way. Mayor Ernie Troiano Jr told Press of Atlantic City, 'I'm sick of hearing people complain . about the disrespectful individuals who walk around with their butts . hanging out.' Visitors to the boardwalk in Wildwood, New Jersey, may soon be subject to dress regulations, including pants no lower than three inches below the waistline . The proposed rules are contained in a new . city ordinance, up for a public hearing June 12, titled 'Establishing . decency standards on the public Boardwalk'. Under the regulations, the waistband of pants, shorts, swimsuits, and skirts can be no lower than three inches below the waist to prevent the exposure of skin or underwear. Other regulations require shirts to be worn between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m, and shoes that 'adequately protect one's feet from wood or nails protruding from the surface of the boardwalk must be worn at all times'. Mayor Troiano Jr said the shoe requirement was a safety issue, while the clothing rules reflect the town's values and the image it wants to project. 'I know the social climate's changed and what people think is decent is different than it was,' Troiano said. Wearing pants low, often belted well below the hip, is a fashion popular among young skaters, who may soon be forced to pull up their pants in Wildwood, New Jersey . Commissioner Peter Byron said he supported the ordinance in its current form. 'I think it's obnoxious with these kids who wear their pants down around their knees,' Byron said, adding he sometimes receives complaints from people unhappy with the style of dress. Other towns such as Cape May and Ocean City have some regulation in place regarding clothing on their respective promenade and boardwalk. Meanwhile, laws similar to Wildwood's proposed ordinance have been enacted in communities around the country, including Terrebone Parish, Louisiana, and Cocoa, Florida. A public hearing on the ordinance is scheduled for June 12 at City Hall.","Ban would prohibit visitors to Wildwood, New Jersey's boardwalk from wearing pants more than three inches below the waist .

fffd2fe47548b7f2b5621765190a74c2a25798b7,"(CNN) -- The plight of a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl who could die within weeks without a lung transplant has sparked a fight for new rules governing organ donations. Tens of thousands of people have signed a petition on Change.org, and a congressman has called on the Obama administration to take quick action. Sarah Murnaghan -- whose story CNN chronicled -- needs new lungs. She's been in a Philadelphia hospital for months due to the cystic fibrosis that she's had since birth. She's at the top of the list for any pediatric lungs that may become available for transplant in her region. She's been waiting for 18 months. None have come along. But doctors say modified adult lungs could help save her -- and adult lungs become available much more often. That's where the rules becomes a problem. Kids under age 12 aren't prioritized for adult organs. So Sarah could only get available adult lungs if everyone else waiting for lungs in her region -- no matter how sick they are -- turns them down. Sarah's mother, Janet Murnaghan, told CNN she was ""shocked"" when she learned the rules a couple of weeks ago. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) manages the nation's transplant system under contract with the Department of Health and Human Services. The network, established by Congress, is officially called the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). Lawmaker assails 'tragic unfairness' Rep. Patrick Meehan, a Republican who represents Sarah's district, sent a letter Tuesday to Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, calling on her to convene a meeting of the network's leadership immediately ""to address this tragic unfairness and act to give Sarah a chance at life and an adult lung from the next available donor. Sarah's young life literally hangs in the balance."" It's a message echoed on the Change.org petition. ""This policy needs to change,"" it reads. ""The OPTN/UNOS Lung Review Board, a national group of transplant physicians and surgeons, can make an exceptional ruling for Sarah. And they can recommend new policies."" People posted heartfelt messages along with their signatures. ""Because my daughter had (cystic fibrosis) and a double lung transplant. Give this little girl the life she is entitled to!"" wrote Reyna Kosla. ""She has just as much right to have a transplant as any adult. She could have her whole life if given that chance and for the parents to enjoy what some waiting adults have already experienced,"" wrote Lorraine Husack. Organ network: Breaking the rules could hurt another patient . OPTN issued a statement noting that there is a separate policy for children because the ""biological needs and circumstances of candidates younger than age 12 are different from either adolescent or adult candidates. One key difference is the size and lung capacity of donors and patients among these age ranges."" Kids younger than age 12 are prioritized for donations from other kids of similar age and size within a 1,000-mile radius. Policies allow ""status adjustments for specifically defined groups of candidates with unique medical circumstances not addressed by the overall policy,"" the statement says. But, it adds, a ""request to adjust the status of a patient under age 12 so that they may be included in the allocation sequence for adolescents and adults is not within the scope of the existing lung allocation policy. OPTN cannot create a policy exemption on behalf of an individual patient, since giving an advantage to one patient may unduly disadvantage others."" The network routinely reviews policies and considers ""public input as well as medical data and experience,"" the statement said. Dr. Stuart Sweet, a board member at UNOS, helped develop the current policies. ""There is no perfect system,"" he told CNN. ""It's the best we can do right now."" Sweet said Sarah's story ""tugs at his heart"" but that if he changed the system for Sarah's advantage, ""there's another patient, very likely an adolescent, who gets a disadvantage."" ""We've built a system that tries to be as fair to everyone as possible."" CNN's Chris Welch, Zain Asher, and Jennifer Bixler contributed to this report.","10-year-old Sarah Murnaghan could die within weeks if she doesn't get new lungs .

fffd571b1b78d9156c4fcf8d7b8b6bd0cc17175b,"Australia was settled by a wave of immigrants from India little more than 4,000 years ago, a genetic study shows. The finding overturns the view that the continent was isolated from the time it was first colonised about 45,000-50,000 years ago until Europeans discovered Australia in the eighteenth century. DNA evidence suggests that rather than complete most of the journey over several generations by foot, the Indian migrants came over by boat. By the time the Indian settlers reached Australia the ancient land bridge was under water so they sailed. Australia’s first human colonisation was the culmination of the long walk out of Africa by the human species. Humans are believed to have left Africa, via the Arabian coast and through India before reaching Indonesia and New Guinea and finally over an ancient land bridge to Australia. Following their arrival there was, according to ‘the prevailing view’, little if any contact between Australia’s Aboriginal inhabitants and the rest of the world. But DNA evidence has now revealed a second wave of human settlement took place about 4,230 years ago, long before the first European settled there. Australia was first seen by a European in 1606 when it was sighted from a ship and a further 53 vessels arrived before Captain James Cook arrived in 1770 to claim it for Britain. Analysis of DNA samples from Aboriginal people living in the Northern Territories of Australia today shows that they have up to 11 per cent of their genetic heritage is Indian . The new settlers came from India and the . lack of their DNA in other parts of Asia suggests they sailed directly . across the Indian Ocean rather than work their way towards Australia by . foot. Scientists found strong evidence of a wave of settlers from India reaching Australia 141 generations ago. Aborignals who took part in the study were found to have up to 11 per cent of their DNA from Indian descent. Intriguingly, their arrival corresponds to evidence in the archaeological record that shows dingos reached Australia about the same time, suggesting they may have been transported by boat by the human settlers. Dr Irina Pugach, of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, said the international research team calculated that the Indian DNA reached the Aboriginal population 141 generations ago. Assuming that each generation is . separated on average by 30 years the geneticists were able to conclude . that the Indian population arrived on in Australia 4230 years ago. James Cook was born in Marton, in Yorkshire, in 1728. He worked for a shopkeeper before joining the Navy. In 1768 he set off in HM bark Endeavour, a former collier, on a secret mission to find land for King George III. In 1770 Cook located the east coast of Australia named it New South Wales and claimed it for Britain. He was killed in 1779 by islanders on Hawaii. ‘Interestingly this date also coincides with many changes in the archaeological record of Australia, which include a sudden change in plant processing and stone tool technologies, with microliths appearing for the first time, and the first appearance of the dingo in the fossil record,’ she said. ‘Since we detect inflow of genes from India into Australia at around the same time, it is likely that these changes were related to this migration.’ Mark Stoneking, a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute, led the study and told Nature magazine: ‘Australia is thought to represent one of the earliest migrations for humans after they left Africa, but it seemed pretty isolated after that.’ DNA from 344 people was analysed for the study, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Samples were taken from people in Papua New Guinea, South East Asia, China, the US and Australia’s Northern Territory. The dingo is thought to have reached Australia with humans about 4,230 years ago.","Genes reveal that a wave of Indian migrants arrived 4,230 years ago .

Marco Reus, Ilkay Gundogan, Fabio Coentrao, Paul Pogba and Arturo Vidal are among the names in circulation at Manchester United. They are the kind of reinforcements David Moyes will need if United are to challenge once again for the Barclays Premier League title. Aside from their wage demands, here are the two questions they will be asking of United’s chief executive Ed Woodward: . Crucial duo: Whether United sign anyone could depend on Robin van Persie (left) and Wayne Rooney . Turin talent: United have been watching Juventus midfield pair Paul Pogba (left) and Arturo Vidal . The fact that neither question can be answered by Moyes or Woodward is hardly a great selling point for one of the biggest clubs in world football. Without satisfactory answers to either of those questions, it is impossible for a top player to consider signing for Manchester United. In the last five seasons, Rooney has scored 85 goals in 137 Premier League appearances. Over the same period Van Persie has 90 in 128 in the league. If Rooney and Van Persie are not in the team, then United cannot hope to win a competitive Premier League, let alone the Champions League. Let’s be honest, Reus and Gundogan - who played in Borussia Dortmund’s midfield in last season's European Cup final - won’t fancy threading balls into the path of Javier Hernandez. Decent enough player, but Reus and Gundogan, who scored Dortmund’s equaliser in the final against Bayern Munich, operate on a different level: inside the Westfalenstadion they rely on Robert Lewandowski. Rooney and Van Persie are on the same wavelength, elite players who are capable of turning games with a twist of their hips and a finish to match. Can Pogba, who left United for Juventus in controversial circumstances two years ago, or Vidal really rely on the fading talents of Antonio Valencia or the inconsistency of Ashley Young on either wing? Probably not. Realistically, this United team is all about Rooney and Van Persie. Rooney, who earns £250,000 a week, is coming up 10 years as a United player. His future at Old Trafford is far from certain. There is nothing scheduled to discuss terms on a revised contract that will expire in less than 18 months. Dortmund duo: Marco Reus and Ilkay Gundogan (below) are also on David Moyes's radar . Since the interest from Chelsea last . summer, there has been nothing to suggest that Rooney will commit his . long-term future to United. It is still possible that the United forward, who has been in Egypt with his family recovering from injury, will leave in the summer. There is, of course, an argument that United must cash in at the end of the season to prevent him walking away on a free transfer in the June 2015. The practicality is that United wrote off his transfer valuation five years after he was signed from Everton for 2004. Anything they get from here is a bonus. To meet accounting standards, the £28m United paid for him was amortised between 2004, when he left Goodison Park, and 2009. So, anything United . get for Rooney from here is good business because his transfer fee . from Everton was effectively written off five years ago. Left back on the agenda: Fabio Coentrao, here training with Cristiano Ronaldo, is a long-term United target . Rooney is one issue for incoming players and Van Persie, especially his continued absence from the United team, is another. We . have been here before with Van Persie when he was at Arsenal, when . injuries disrupted the early periods of his career in north London. He has only played two full seasons in the Premier League since his move to England from Feyenoord in the summer of 2004. Two years ago, when he was elevated to the role of captain at Arsenal, he played in every league game and scored 30 goals. Talisman: Wayne Rooney (right) has been United's best player this season but is yet to sign a new deal . Hold on to them! Van Persie (right) and Rooney (centre) celebrate the Dutchman's goal against Arsenal . Last . season at United, when he won the title in his first season at Old . Trafford, he scored 26 times in 38 Premier League appearances. Now he is sidelined with niggling injuries and no-one, including Moyes, knows when he will return. Van . Persie, who is captain of the Holland team who will be appearing at the . World Cup in Brazil this summer, has not played since December 10. His . last goal was against Arsenal, the winner at Old . Trafford on Novemer 10 after 27 minutes. Watching brief: Moyes ran the rule over Pogba and Vidal in Juve's weekend match at Cagliari . This may be unfounded, but it doesn’t feel as though he has the same appetite for the game now that he finally has a Premier League medal. For someone struggling with groin and toe injuries, he has been out of the game for a long time. His return date is unspecified. Him and Rooney are the two players that can make a difference when it comes to lifting silverware at the end of a season. Without them, United simply don't have the same appeal.","Manchester United need to decide on Wayne Rooney's future now .

The only child of former U.S. President Bill Clinton has said she is no longer able to completely rule out the possibility of making a political bid if, at some point, she did not support her local representatives. The 34-year-old suggested she may be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator. Scroll down for video . Future bid: Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton has said she may one day consider running for office . Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her father, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, suggested she may one day be open to running for a number of offices, from mayor to senator . In an interview, Clinton told Fast Company how ever since being a child she had always been asked about going into politics, with the answer usually being a plain 'no'. But now, she said, the answer was not so clear. She said: 'I live in a city and a state and a country where I support my elected representatives. 'If at some point that weren't the case, and I didn't support my mayor or my city councilwoman or my congressman or either of my senators - and I'm lucky to live in a state where I have lots of women representing me, you know - maybe then I'd have to ask and answer the question for myself, and come to a different answer.' It is not the first time Clinton, currently vice chair of the recently rebranded Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation, has spoken in these terms - she has previously given a similar response to Marlo Thomas, as published on The Huffington Post. And after delivering a keynote speech at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas last month, she said she was slowly changing her mind about whether to run for office herself in coming years, according to Buzzfeed. Chelsea Clinton, pictured with her mother, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has said she cannot completely rule out ever running for office . 'I donâ€™t know,' she said. 'For a long time, my answer to that question was no. 'At the moment I find it pretty discouraging that almost none of my friends think about running for public office as an option.' Last month, MailOnline reported on how Clinton told the tech conference what it was like growing up in one of America's most famous and powerful families - and how she learned to debate with them on major issues from the age of six. And while her father may have been the leader of the free world and her mother the U.S. Secretary of State, criss-crossing the globe solving international crises, they both needed their daughter's help to learn how to text. 'I definitely taught my parents how to text and how to charge their phones,' Chelsea Clinton said, adding the latter was 'a very mysterious thing' for her parents. Of the mock debates the family would have at home in Arkansas, she told how she would argue with one of her parents and the other would act as moderator.","Chelsea Clinton said question of running for office is no longer 'visceral no'

Van Winkle has told investigators he was 'going to purchase' the home that the stolen property was removed from. He is accused of breaking into a vacant home and stolen furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items. 'I'm still actively trying to by this house,' he told the network. 'It's just sad the way this has played out. It's not me.' 'I feel horrible. It's the worst day of my life.' The burglarized residence, which is in foreclosure, is near a home that Van Winkle was working on for his show on DIY Network, The Vanilla Ice Project, and some of the stolen property was later found at Van Winkle's personal home, police say. It has been reported however that Van Winkle told his work crew that he owned the home, and sent them over twice to burgle the property.

Speaking just months before his untimely death, Chris Kyle insisted his only regret was that US lives were lost because he shot too few of the enemy. The late veteran's wartime exploits are portrayed in the divisive Oscar-tipped movie American Sniper, starring Bradley Cooper and directed by Clint Eastwood. Little regrets: In an interview three years ago America's most lethal sniper Chris Kyle claimed he wished he'd 'killed more' Iraqis . Speaking to Toby Harnden of The Sunday Times three years ago, Kyle was asked whether he regretted any of his kills while on tour. Replying in his characteristically soft Texan drawl, the former sniper, said: 'No, sir, not at all. 'To be honest with you, I wish I'd killed more because every kill saved American lives and that was what I was out there for.' Kyle was thrilled by the success of his autobiographical book, which led to 'huge fascination' with the grisly art of snipers. The soldier, played by Bradley Cooper in Oscar-tipped film American Sniper (L), accumulated 160 confirmed kills in Iraq, with the true number estimated to be as high as 255 . In the 2012 interview, he added: 'It's been a taboo for too long, I'm glad that people are actually looking at it with an interest and saying these guys are actually something we need.' Less than a year after the conversation, Kyle was killed on a remote shooting range in Texas by a disturbed veteran he was helping, who was said to have been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Opinion: Seth Rogen caused a Twitter storm with a tweet about American Sniper . The movie based on Kyle's book, produced by and starring Bradley Cooper, has been a box office hit, but has also divided opinion, with some criticising the film's jingoistic stance. Filmmaker Michael Moore caused an online debate when he tweeted about how he was raised to believe snipers were 'cowards' since his uncle died by a Japanese sniper shot in World War II. Taking to Twitter in rage, the Fahrenheit 9/11 director seethed: 'My uncle killed by sniper in WW2. We were taught snipers were cowards. Will shoot u in the back. Snipers aren't heroes. And invaders r worse.' Seth Rogen also caused controversy after tweeting: 'American Sniper kind of reminds me of the movie that's showing in the third act of Inglorious Basterds.' The comedy actor faced a storm of online abuse for his comment and recently issued a clarification and apology. He wrote: ‘It appears I need to further clarify a tweet I sent a few days ago. 'I said a sniper movie kind of reminded me of a scene in another movie that involved a sniper movie. 'I didn't compare the two at all. I merely said that one kind of reminded me of the other, because they both involved plots about the most lethal of snipers. ‘People then claimed that I compared the movie American Sniper to Nazi propaganda, something I would never do. 'I'm sorry if this somehow offended anyone, but that was not my intention. I hope this clears things up.’ Critics of the movie included talk show host Bill Maher, who claimed the film is only cleaning up at the box office because audiences lap up its 'psychopath' hero. Controversy: Rogen said American Sniper (still on the right) reminded him of Nation's Pride (still on the left), a fake Nazi propaganda film from Quentin Tarantino's World War II film Inglorious Basterds . Speaking on his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher, he drew on excerpts from the autobiography Kyle wrote before he was killed in February 2013, in which he said he enjoyed war and referred to his targets as 'savages'. Kid Rock was one of the first stars to wade in on the debate stirred up by Rogen and Moore, tweeting: ‘: 'F— you Michael Moore, you’re a piece of s— and your uncle would be ashamed of you. Seth Rogen, your uncle probably molested you. I hope both of you catch a fist to the face soon. 'God bless you Chris Kyle, Thank you for your service.'

The film, directed by Clint Eastwood, was then compared with Hurt Locker, another film centered on the Iraq war which made far less money, though won widespread praise. Maher said: 'Hurt Locker' made $17million because it was a little ambiguous and thoughtful... [American Sniper] is just ""American hero! He's a psychopath patriot, and we love him.""'

A swarm of an estimated 30 million . insects had been devastating crops in Egypt, putting authorities on high alert as sparrow-sized locusts began making their way . into Israel earlier this week. Reports suggest that the insects are . mainly concentrated in areas of southern Israel, but sightings have been . reported elsewhere. Chef Moshe Bassoon who cooks locusts . in his Jerusalem restaurant says he counts himself 'lucky' to have been . able to get wild insects for his eatery. 'You want them plump and meaty,' he . told The Times, suggesting different ways of cooking the insects, . including rolling them in chickpea batter and frying them in oil until . they 'turn red - like a lobster.' Holiday food: Locusts are not only delicious, local Israeli chefs say, but also kosher and the perfect treat . Damaging: A swarms of locusts fly near Kadesh Barnea, in Jerusalem, Israel, yesterday after crossing the border from neighbouring Egypt . Mr Basson ensures the winged creatures are kosher, as he himself had to prove their status to a rabbi before he began serving them at his restaurant. 'I had to bring a male and a female and the eggs to the rabbi for his examination,' he said. 'And I had to prove that there was a local tradition of Jews eating them.' The . locust alert comes ahead of the week long Passover festival, which begins on March 25. It . recounts the biblical story of the Israelite exodus from Egypt, during which, according . to the Bible, a huge swarm of locusts was the eighth of 10 plagues God . imposed on Egyptians to persuade Pharaoh to free the ancient Hebrews . from slavery.

Israel's Agriculture Ministry sent . out planes to spray pesticides over agricultural fields earlier in the . week to prevent damage by the locusts and set up an emergency hotline . and asked Israelis to report sightings.

'We hope our . actions are effective,' one of the pilots of a plane spraying the fields . said on Army Radio. 'Let's hope the damage will be minimal.'

Insects are not just something which features in Heston Blumenthal’s recipes, and are eaten as snacks or part of healthy meals across the globe. The practice is most common in Asia, but has not been unheard of in the western world. ‘Insects are a healthy, nutritious and tasty alternative. Many contain as much – or more – protein as meat or fish. 'Some insects, especially in the larval stage, are also rich in fat and contain significant percentages of amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals,’ says food writer Stefan Gates, a panellist on BBC Radio 4’s Kitchen Cabinet. In Thailand it is not uncommon that schools feed crickets for lunch and in Cambodia young boys go hunting for tarantulas which they fry and eat. In China beetles and roaches are sold as snacks at markets. More than 1,000 insects are eaten in 80 per cent of countries around the world - mainly those in the tropics. The tradition might be spreading to the UK as Giant Toasted Ants are already available at Selfridges for £14.99 a pack.

ffffd563a96104f5cf4493cfa701a65f31b06abf,"(CNN)Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has decided to ""actively explore"" a presidential bid after conversations with his family over Thanksgiving, he said in a Facebook post Tuesday. While Bush had been making steps toward a presidential bid with recent speeches in early primary states and plans to release documents from his time period as governor, the timing of Tuesday's announcement was widely unexpected and will quicken the pace for some would-be Republican primary challengers. In the post, Bush writes that over the holiday he ""talked about the future of the nation"" with his family. ""As a result of these conversations and thoughtful consideration of the kind of strong leadership I think America needs, I have decided to actively explore the possibility of running for President of the United States,"" he said. Bush has been moving toward a run for months and in recent days sparked renewed speculation over his plans with a visit to the all-important early primary state of South Carolina to give a commencement speech Monday, and his comments in a Sunday interview that he felt he ""would be a good president."" RELATED: Bush to grads: 'Shake things up' Democrats scoffed at his announcement. Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee suggested it was simply meant to draw press, but dismissed the possibility of a Bush run either way. ""I don't know what the difference is between 'thinking about' running and 'actively exploring' running, but I suspect it has a lot to do with keeping his name in the news,"" Elleithee said. ""However you see it, there's no parsing this simple fact: Jeb Bush has fully embraced the failed economic agenda that benefits only a select few at the expense of the middle class. That's not going to change no matter how many different ways he says he may run."" Bush's announcement is sure to speed up the timeline for many other potential Republican presidential contenders on whether to jump in as well. Bush is seen as a top pick for establishment Republicans hoping to encourage the party to nominate a candidate they see as most electable on the national stage. Many observers believe if Bush jumps in the race, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio — who's been mentored by Bush since his entry into Florida politics — wouldn't run. And he'd likely make it tougher for some of the more establishment-minded governors, like Texas Gov. Rick Perry or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, to find footing in the race. However, a source near Rubio said Tuesday that while Bush's announcement changes the dynamic of the race, the junior Florida Senator is still ""on track to run for president"" in 2016. And Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has been actively preparing for a bid and would likely run to Bush's right flank, also seemed nonplussed by the announcement. ""I think we're a big tent -- we can use moderates, conservatives, libertarians — we need em all,"" he told reporters walking into the Capitol. Asked whether he could win the nomination, Paul demurred. ""I think the more the merrier -- the public will determine that."" Bush added in Tuesday's post that he hopes ""to visit with many of you and have a conversation about restoring the promise of America"" in the coming months. RELATED: 6 things to know about Jeb Bush . Bush also announced the creation of a PAC, which will aim to ""support leaders, ideas and policies that will expand opportunity and prosperity for all Americans."" He added that the PAC would ""facilitate conversations with citizens across America to discuss the most critical challenges facing our exceptional nation."" On Sunday, Bush also announced plans to release about 250,000 emails from his time in office and an upcoming e-book about his time as governor, moves seen as efforts to re-introduce Americans to his governing chops in preparation to emerge as a more prominent player on the national stage. If he does make his bid official, he'll likely face fierce opposition from conservatives in the primary, who have long been frustrated with his advocacy for Common Core educational standards and his support for a more moderate vision of immigration reform. RELATED: Bush releases 250,000 emails . He's previously expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, though he's wavered in that support since. And while he's come out in opposition to President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration, he's also urged Republicans to act on immigration reform ""rather than have their heads explode."" That moderation on immigration reform — and his diverse family, as his wife was born in Mexico and he speaks fluent Spanish — have many in the GOP hopeful Bush could help the party overcome some of their deficit with Hispanic voters, which has proven to be problematic for them in national races. Despite the likely conservative opposition, Bush has hinted he wouldn't shift to the far-right to please GOP primary voters if he runs. During the Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting earlier this month, Bush warned that the GOP presidential nominee shouldn't ""lose the primary to win the general without violating your principles."" The comments came as the conservative and more centrist wings of the GOP continue to debate a path forward for the party, with many on the right arguing former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost in 2012 because he didn't stand strong enough on conservative principles. But Romney and Bush, despite the conservative criticism, remain two of the most popular figures in the party, and indeed both led the recent McClatchy-Marist national poll of the potential GOP presidential field. Romney took 19 percent, while Bush came in second with 14 percent support; with Romney out of the race, Bush would lead with 16 percent support, followed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee with 12 percent. Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.","Other 2016 hopefuls maintain that Bush's announcement wouldn't prevent them from running .
